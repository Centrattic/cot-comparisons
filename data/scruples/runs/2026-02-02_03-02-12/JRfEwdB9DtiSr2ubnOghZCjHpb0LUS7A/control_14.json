He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. So, the situation is that Jake's wife passed away, and he's really struggling. He shows up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief, so they didn't let him stay. But Jake is in a fragile state, using sleeping pills, and maybe even considering something worse. The author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, but the author thinks they were helping.\n\nSo, the key points are: Jake is grieving, in a state of depression, possibly suicidal. The author's action led Jake to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome might be harmful. There's a balance between pushing someone to be independent and providing necessary support during a crisis. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, when someone is in severe emotional distress, especially with children involved, the community's role is to support them. Denying shelter could be seen as not providing necessary support. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Maybe they thought Jake could handle it, but Jake's actions suggest he's not able to, leading to a risky situation.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, indicating that their decision had negative consequences. The author might not have considered Jake's mental state fully. Even with good intentions, the outcome was Jake being homeless, which is a serious issue. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide the necessary support during a critical time, leading to a worse situation.\n\nBut wait, the author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief. Maybe they thought that by not letting him stay, they were pushing him to face reality. But when someone is in a suicidal crisis, immediate safety is more important than long-term coping strategies. The author might have underestimated the urgency of Jake's mental health crisis.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because not providing shelter to someone in a vulnerable state could be seen as a failure to support them when they needed it most, leading to harmful consequences.\n"
