He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a best friend, Jake, who's struggling after his wife's death. He shows up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Later, Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Grief is a complex emotion, and people handle it differently. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author's decision might come off as harsh. The author's intention was to help by pushing Jake to cope, but forcing him out when he's unwell might not be the best approach. Allowing the daughter to stay was good, but refusing Jake could have left him without support, leading to the night on the streets.\n\nThe key points are: Jake was in a mental health crisis, the author refused him shelter, and the result was worse. Even if the author's intention was to help, the action might have been too abrupt. Friends in crisis might need more immediate support. The author could have offered alternatives like a temporary stay with conditions or connecting him with professional help. Refusing without other options might be seen as inconsiderate, hence AITA could be on the author's side. So the answer is A.\n"
