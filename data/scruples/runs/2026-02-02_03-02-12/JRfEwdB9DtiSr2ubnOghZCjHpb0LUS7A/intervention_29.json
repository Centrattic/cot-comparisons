He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves Jake, the author's best friend, who lost his wife and is struggling. Jake shows up at the author's house with his daughter at 1 AM, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter but not Jake, leading Jake to sleep on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is grieving, which is a very sensitive and emotional time. He's clearly in a bad state, using sleeping pills, and avoiding his house. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief by not enabling him to stay in a place that triggers bad memories. But Jake ended up in a worse situation by sleeping outside, which the wife later criticized.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that forcing Jake to stay in his house might help him confront his grief rather than avoid it. However, Jake's immediate need was shelter and support. The author's refusal, while well-intentioned, didn't account for the immediate safety and well-being of both Jake and his daughter. The daughter is a minor, and the author allowed her to stay but not the father, which could be seen as neglecting the family unit during a crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have considered the emotional complexity of Jake's situation. Grief can impair judgment, and pushing someone to stay in a triggering environment without proper support can be harmful. The author might have been trying to help, but the approach could have been more compassionate. Maybe suggesting professional help or connecting him with other support systems would have been better than a blunt refusal.\n\nThe key points here are intention vs. impact. The author's intention was to help Jake heal, but the impact was that Jake felt abandoned and resorted to sleeping on the streets. The daughter's safety is also a factor\u2014leaving the daughter with Jake might have been risky if he's in such a bad state. However, allowing the daughter in but not the father could split the family, which might not be in the child's best interest either.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, friends are expected to provide support during crises. The author's refusal, even if for a good reason, might be seen as not fulfilling that role. But it's also understandable that the author is trying to encourage Jake to face his grief rather than avoid it. The line between helping and enabling is thin here.\n\nI think the author's approach was misguided. While the intention was good, the method of refusal without offering alternative support (like contacting a shelter or a support group) could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests that the author's action didn't consider the immediate consequences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they failed to provide necessary support and instead caused harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
