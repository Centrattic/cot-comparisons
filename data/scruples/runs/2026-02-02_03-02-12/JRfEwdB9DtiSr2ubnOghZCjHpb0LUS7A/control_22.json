He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for not letting his best friend stay at his house after his wife's death. So, the situation is that Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he showed up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jake's mental state. He's in deep grief, possibly experiencing depression, and is taking sleeping pills to cope. Coming to a friend's house in the middle of the night might be a cry for help. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but by not allowing Jake to stay, maybe he didn't provide the necessary support during a crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought that allowing Jake to stay would prevent him from dealing with his emotions. However, Jake's actions (sleeping on the streets) suggest that he's in a vulnerable state. The author's wife is upset, calling him an asshole, which indicates that his decision was harsh. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend is in extreme emotional distress, the author allowed the child to stay but not Jake, and the consequence was Jake sleeping on the streets. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. Jake might have needed immediate support rather than being turned away. The author could have found a middle ground, like allowing Jake to stay temporarily while encouraging him to seek professional help. \n\nSo, the author's decision might be seen as not supportive enough during a critical time, especially since Jake's actions indicated he wasn't in a position to handle being alone. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
