He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling a lot. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter in the middle of the night. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking that he needs to get over his grief. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect here. Jake is in a severe depression after his wife's death. He's using sleeping pills, which is concerning. He's also not neglecting his daughter, but it's mentioned he's barely holding together. The author's main argument is that they wanted to help Jake get through his grief, but their action was to not let him stay, which led to him being on the streets. \n\nNow, the ethical part. Is it reasonable to refuse someone shelter after they've lost a loved one, especially when they're in such a fragile state? The author's intention was good, but the outcome was harmful. Even if the intention was to push Jake to heal, by not allowing him to stay, they might have contributed to his immediate distress. Also, the author allowed the child to stay but not Jake, which could be seen as inconsistent. Jake might have felt rejected by his best friend, which could worsen his mental state.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt overwhelmed, especially being woken up at 1 AM. They might not have the capacity to host both Jake and his daughter. However, in a crisis, friends often step up. The author could have considered other options, like finding a shelter for Jake or contacting his family. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests that the author didn't provide any alternative support, which could make their action seem harsh.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a point. She called the author a massive asshole, indicating that she thinks the action was wrong. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help him get over it, but pushing someone in such a vulnerable state might not be the right approach. Grief is complex, and not allowing space to grieve might not be helpful. Also, the author's decision might have been influenced by their own discomfort with the situation rather than what's best for Jake's immediate well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help, the method used was harmful. The lack of alternative support and the immediate consequence of Jake sleeping outside suggests that the author was in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
