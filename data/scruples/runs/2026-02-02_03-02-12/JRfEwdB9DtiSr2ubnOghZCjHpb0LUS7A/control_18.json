He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't let their friend stay over is in the wrong. So the situation is that Jake's wife died, and he's really struggling. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter at 1 AM, and the author only let the daughter stay but not Jake. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset, but they think they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, and his mental health might be so bad that he's not thinking clearly. He was taking sleeping pills, which is concerning. The author's intention was to help him move past his grief by not letting him stay. But is that the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the author might think that enabling Jake by letting him stay would prevent him from dealing with his problems. They might believe that pushing him to face his home environment is necessary for healing. However, Jake is in a fragile state. Denying him shelter without providing alternatives could be harmful. Also, he has a child with him. Even though the author allowed the daughter, Jake's presence is crucial for the child's safety and care.\n\nThe author's action might be seen as not providing sufficient support. Instead of saying no, maybe they could have found another solution, like contacting other friends or family, or even arranging temporary housing. By not allowing Jake to stay, they might have contributed to his decision to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous, especially for someone in a vulnerable state.\n\nAlso, the way the author handled it\u2014saying he can't stay because he needs to get over it\u2014might come off as dismissive of his grief. Grief is a process, and each person handles it differently. Telling someone they need to \"get over it\" can be invalidating. The author's wife calling them an asshole makes sense because refusing help without alternatives could be seen as cruel.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to help by not letting Jake avoid his problems. But in this situation, immediate support might be more critical. Jake's mental health is at risk, and without proper support, his actions could lead to self-harm or worse. The author might not have considered the immediate risks and focused too much on the long-term solution.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention was to help Jake deal with his grief, the method was flawed. Denying shelter without providing alternatives can be harmful, especially when the person is in crisis. The author should have found another way to support Jake instead of turning him away. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
