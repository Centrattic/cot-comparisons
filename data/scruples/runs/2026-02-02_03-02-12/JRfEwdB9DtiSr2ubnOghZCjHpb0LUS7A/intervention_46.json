He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's in a lot of pain, and his actions are a result of grief. He's already showing signs of depression and self-harm through pills. The author's intention was to help him get over his grief, but the method might have been harsh. \n\nThen, the author's action: allowing the daughter but not Jake. Maybe the author thought that by not letting Jake stay, he would have to face his situation. However, forcing someone in such a vulnerable state to be alone could be dangerous. Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, which the author didn't intend, but it's still a consequence of their decision.\n\nThe author's wife called them a massive asshole, which adds to the conflict. The author's intention was good, but the outcome was negative. The key here is whether the action was appropriate. In grief, people need support, not additional pressure. By denying Jake a place to stay, the author might have inadvertently pushed him into a worse situation. \n\nAlso, Jake's daughter being involved complicates things. The author allowed the child, which is responsible, but not the father. Maybe there's a balance between helping Jake and ensuring the child's safety. But Jake's mental state is critical here. The author's approach might lack empathy for someone in severe emotional distress.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action, though well-intentioned, might be seen as lacking the necessary support during a critical time. Forcing someone to face grief alone when they're already struggling could be harmful. The right approach might have been to seek professional help or find another support system instead of cutting off immediate support. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not providing the needed support, even if the intention was to help.\n"
