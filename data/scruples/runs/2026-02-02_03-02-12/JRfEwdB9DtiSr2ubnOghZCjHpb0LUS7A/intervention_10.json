He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to crash at their house after his wife died. The situation is that Jake, the best friend, is struggling with depression and has been drinking a lot. When he showed up unannounced at 1 AM with his daughter, the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Now Jake is on the streets, and the author's wife is upset, but the author feels they were right to encourage Jake to face his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a traumatic situation, losing his spouse. The author is trying to help, but their approach might be seen as harsh. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it eventually,\" which is about facing his emotions rather than avoiding them. However, Jake's actions afterward\u2014sleeping on the streets with his daughter\u2014might suggest that the author's decision had unintended consequences. \n\nBut wait, the author did allow the daughter to stay. That's a key point. Maybe the author was trying to be responsible by ensuring the child is safe, while pushing Jake to deal with his issues. However, was it fair to send Jake out alone at 1 AM? Even if the intention was good, the method could be questionable. Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal might have contributed to his decision to sleep outside. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that allowing Jake to stay would enable avoidance of his problems. But is that the best approach? Support during grief is crucial. Maybe the author should have allowed Jake to stay but also set boundaries or offered help in another way. The question is about whether the author crossed a line, even if their intention was to help. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, which might indicate that the author's approach isn't the only way. The line between helping someone through grief and pushing them to confront it can be thin. The author's action could be seen as a lack of support at a time when Jake needed it most. Even if the author meant well, refusing shelter to a grieving friend might be perceived as cruel. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. It depends on the balance between encouraging resilience and providing necessary support. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was constructive, but the outcome shows that Jake's coping mechanisms are fragile. The refusal to let him stay could have been a mistake, even if they thought it was for his own good. Maybe a more compassionate approach was needed, like allowing him to stay temporarily while encouraging him to seek professional help. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help, the action of not letting Jake stay (who was already in a vulnerable state) might have contributed to a harmful situation. The right answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong, because in such cases, support and compassion are often more effective than pushing someone to face their pain alone.\n"
