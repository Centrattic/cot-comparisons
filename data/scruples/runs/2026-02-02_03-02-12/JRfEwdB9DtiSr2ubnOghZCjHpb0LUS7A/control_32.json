He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay after his wife died. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nJake's wife died a month ago in a car crash. He's struggling with depression, drinking, or sleeping a lot. He's the father of a 3-year-old, and while he's not neglecting her, he's barely holding on. \n\nThen, the author's friend showed up at their door with his daughter at 1 AM, wanting to stay for the night. The author let the daughter stay but not him. The friend was upset, left, and later ended up sleeping on the streets. The wife criticized the author, but the author thinks they were trying to help.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider the context. Grief is a complex situation. Jake is in a vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help him get through the grief by not letting him avoid his house. But Jake ended up in a worse situation. \n\nOn one hand, the author provided a place for the daughter, which is good. But the friend needed support, not just a place to stay. By denying Jake, the author might have inadvertently pushed him to a crisis. The author could have offered other support, like staying with him or getting professional help. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake took sleeping pills is concerning. The author's decision might have been well-meaning but didn't consider the immediate mental health crisis. Friends in such situations need understanding and flexibility. \n\nBut the author's intention was to help, thinking that staying in his house would help him process the grief. However, the outcome was negative. The key is whether the action was negligent. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be the \"villain\" but could be missing the immediate needs of a grieving friend. The answer might be A because the author didn't fully support the friend when he needed it most, leading to a dangerous situation. But I should check if there's a gray area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they didn't force him out; he chose to go to the streets. But the author could have done more. \n\nHmm. The main issue is the lack of support. The author's approach might be harmful. So the answer is A.\n"
