He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is at fault for not letting his friend Jake stay overnight. The situation is Jake's wife just died, and he's really struggling. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional and psychological impact on Jake. Losing a spouse is incredibly traumatic. Jake's behavior sounds like he's in deep grief and possibly in a state of depression or even considering self-harm. The author's decision to let the child stay but not Jake might be seen as trying to help Jake take steps toward healing, but the immediate consequence was Jake going to the streets, which is dangerous.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to push Jake to cope, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate safety and well-being. Jake's mental state might require professional help, and the author might not have the resources or training to handle a crisis. But the author also has a responsibility to their own family's safety and boundaries. \n\nThe author could have offered support in other ways, like helping Jake find temporary housing or connecting him with a counselor. By not allowing Jake to stay, they might have inadvertently put him at risk. On the other hand, the author might not be equipped to handle a more severe mental health crisis, and pushing too hard could be counterproductive. \n\nThe key points are the immediate safety of Jake and his daughter, the appropriateness of the author's response, and whether there were other ways to support Jake without putting him on the streets. The author might not be in the wrong if they acted with good intentions, but there's a possibility they could have handled it better. However, the outcome (Jake on the streets) is concerning. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions, though well-intentioned, directly led to a dangerous situation for Jake. If the author could have done more to ensure Jake was safe, like coordinating with a support system or professional help, then maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But the fact that Jake ended up on the streets might mean the author didn't consider all options. Still, the author isn't a mental health professional, so there's a balance between personal boundaries and community support.\n"
