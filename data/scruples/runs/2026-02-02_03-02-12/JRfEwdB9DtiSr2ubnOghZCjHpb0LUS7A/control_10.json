He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. Jake is dealing with severe grief and depression. He's taking sleeping pills and avoiding his house. When he shows up at the author's door with his daughter, the author lets the kid stay but refuses Jake. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief. However, Jake leaves and ends up on the streets, which the wife is upset about.\n\nSo, the question is whether refusing to let Jake stay was wrong. On one hand, the author might think they're helping by pushing Jake to cope. On the other hand, Jake is in a fragile state, and the refusal might have led to him sleeping outside, which is dangerous.\n\nI should consider the author's intent versus the outcome. The author's intention was to help, but the result was harmful. Even if the intention was good, the refusal without a plan for Jake's safety could be unkind. Also, Jake's actions (taking pills, being in emotional distress) suggest he's in a crisis. The author might have a responsibility to ensure Jake is safe, especially since he's a friend.\n\nAnother angle: allowing the child to stay but not the father could be seen as neglecting Jake's needs. The author might have assumed Jake could handle it, but given his state, that assumption could be wrong. The wife's reaction as a \"massive asshole\" indicates that the action was harsh. Also, the author didn't consider alternative solutions, like finding a shelter or involving other resources.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, helping someone in crisis is important. Even if it's not their legal obligation, the emotional support aspect is part of being a friend. The author might be wrong for not providing the necessary support, leading to a worse outcome. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there are mitigating factors. The author did allow the daughter to stay, which is good, but refusing Jake directly might have been a mistake. The key is whether the refusal directly caused harm. Since Jake ended up on the streets, that's a negative outcome, which would suggest the author is in the wrong.\n"
