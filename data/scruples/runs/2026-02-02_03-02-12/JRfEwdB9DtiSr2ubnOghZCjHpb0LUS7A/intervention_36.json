He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his best friend stay at his house after his wife died. So, the key points here are about grief, support, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the best friend, Jake, is dealing with severe depression after his wife's death. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and even mentioned taking sleeping pills. The author allowed his daughter to stay but not Jake. The wife was upset, but the author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and friends might expect support during such a crisis. Not allowing him to stay could be seen as abandonment, especially when he ended up on the streets. But on the other hand, the author might have set boundaries to encourage independence or protect his own family's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author acted unkindly or inconsiderately. Jake's actions (using pills, being a mess) might have made the author hesitant. Also, maybe the author thought he should take steps to handle his grief without relying on others. However, the outcome was Jake being on the streets, which is a severe consequence. The author's intention wasn't to harm, but the result was harmful.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the intention was good, the result could be seen as neglecting a friend in need. The author didn't let Jake stay, leading him to make a dangerous choice. But was the author responsible for that? Maybe not directly, but there's a responsibility in such situations to ensure the friend is safe.\n\nAnother angle: the author allowed the daughter to stay, which is compassionate. But excluding the father might be seen as not fully supporting Jake. The author's wife was upset, so there might be household dynamics at play. Maybe the author felt overwhelmed, but Jake's mental state was critical.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help Jake become independent, the action might have been too abrupt without providing alternative support. The right approach might have been to offer temporary shelter while encouraging professional help. Not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was good. So, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault.\n"
