He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay at their house after his wife died.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and taking sleeping pills. He showed up at the author's house late at night with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The wife is upset with the author, but the author thinks they were trying to help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are Jake's mental state and the author's responsibility. Jake is in a crisis, dealing with grief and possible suicidal thoughts (since he's taking sleeping pills to sleep). The author had the opportunity to offer a safe place for both Jake and his daughter. By allowing the daughter to stay but not Jake, the author may have inadvertently contributed to Jake sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous and not a safe environment, especially given his mental state.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it,\" but that might be dismissive of his genuine grief and mental health struggles. Even if the intention was to help, not allowing Jake to stay could have led to a worse outcome. The author's wife is upset because they kicked him out, leading to him being homeless that night. The author's action, while perhaps well-meaning, might not have been compassionate enough in the moment.\n\nAdditionally, Jake's actions (taking sleeping pills, being in a depressive state) indicate he might be at risk for self-harm. The author had a chance to intervene but chose not to. Allowing Jake to stay could have prevented him from being alone on the streets. The author's decision, while trying to push Jake to handle his grief, might have been too harsh and not considering his immediate mental health needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's wife was awake and involved. Maybe they thought involving the daughter was enough. But Jake's mental state is critical, and leaving him alone could be dangerous. The author might have a point in wanting to help Jake move past grief, but the method was flawed. There's a balance between letting someone grieve and ensuring they don't harm themselves. The author's approach here seems to lack that balance.\n\nIn summary, the author's refusal to let Jake stay, especially given his mental state and the risk of him ending up on the streets, might be considered in the wrong. The intention was to help, but the action didn't address the immediate need for safety and support.\n"
