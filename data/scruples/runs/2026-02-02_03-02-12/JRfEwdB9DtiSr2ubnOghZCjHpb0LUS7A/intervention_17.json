He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife's death. The situation is pretty heavy.\n\nFirst, the friend, Jake, is clearly in a very vulnerable state. He's grieving, dealing with depression, and using alcohol. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house. However, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets instead, which the author's wife found out and criticized them for.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intent vs. outcome. The author's intention was to help Jake face his grief by not enabling him to avoid his home. But the outcome was that Jake went to the streets, which is a negative result. \n\nGrief can make people act irrationally. The author might have thought that setting boundaries was the right approach, but in doing so, they didn't consider the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter. Even if Jake was being difficult, as a friend, the author might have a responsibility to ensure that he doesn't end up in a dangerous situation. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake was taking sleeping pills and was in a state of depression adds to the concern. The author might have thought they were being strong by not letting him stay, but in reality, they might have failed to provide the necessary support during a time of crisis. \n\nHowever, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which shows some level of care. The conflict arises from the decision to exclude Jake himself. It's possible that the author didn't realize how severe Jake's mental state was or didn't consider alternative solutions, like getting professional help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that they were trying to help by pushing Jake to deal with his grief directly. But in cases of severe depression and suicidal thoughts (implied by the sleeping pills and sleeping on the streets), this approach could be dangerous. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the intention was good, the outcome is critical. The author's decision led to Jake being homeless, which is a serious consequence. Friends have a duty to look out for each other, especially when someone is in a vulnerable state. The author might have a point about wanting to help with the grieving process, but the method was flawed. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the potential harm their decision could cause. They could have found another way to support Jake, like involving other friends, family, or professionals, instead of turning him away. The daughter's safety is also a concern, as Jake leaving to sleep on the streets might have put the child in a risky situation as well.\n"
