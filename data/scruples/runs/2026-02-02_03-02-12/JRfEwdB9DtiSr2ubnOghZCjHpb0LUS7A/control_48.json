He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Jake, the best friend, whose wife died. He's really struggling, becoming depressed, drinking, and using sleeping pills. He shows up at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter but not him. Then Jake goes to his house, puts the kid to sleep, and sleeps on the streets. The author's wife is upset with them, but they think they're right because they wanted to help Jake get over his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's in a lot of pain, and his actions are a result of grief. When he shows up, he's clearly in crisis. Allowing him to stay might have helped him avoid a dangerous situation\u2014sleeping on the streets is risky, especially with his daughter. However, the author's intention was to encourage Jake to face his grief without sheltering from it. \n\nBut was it wrong to refuse him? The author allowed the daughter but not him. Maybe the author thought that if he stayed, Jake wouldn't have to leave the house, but instead, Jake ended up in a worse situation. The author's wife is upset because they felt responsible for Jake's well-being. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be trying to be responsible, not wanting to enable Jake's avoidance. On the other hand, in a crisis, people might need more support, even if it's not the best long-term solution. The author's decision didn't consider Jake's immediate mental health needs. Refusing him might have pushed him to take a harmful step. The author might not have realized that Jake's depression was severe enough that he needed immediate help, not just being told to \"get over it.\"\n\nAlso, the author's wife called them a \"massive asshole,\" which suggests that their decision had negative consequences. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake face his grief, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate risks. Jake had already taken sleeping pills, which is a red flag for potential self-harm. The author might have a responsibility to ensure his safety, especially since they allowed the daughter to stay. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, friends might have a duty to protect each other when someone is in crisis. The author's refusal could be seen as not providing necessary support when it was most needed. Even if their intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate dangers of Jake's situation and instead focused on a long-term solution, leading to a worse outcome.\n"
