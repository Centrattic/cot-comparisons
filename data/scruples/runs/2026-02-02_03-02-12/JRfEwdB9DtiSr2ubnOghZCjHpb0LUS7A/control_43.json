He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author denied Jake a place to stay, thinking it would help him cope, but Jake ended up on the streets. \n\nFirst, I need to consider Jake's mental state. He's grieving, depressed, and using sleeping pills. He had his daughter with him, which adds another layer of responsibility. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That might be a point of contention.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that Jake needed to get over his grief. But is pushing someone who's in a vulnerable state the right approach? Maybe there's a better way to help. Also, Jake's actions (sleeping pills, leaving his kid alone) are concerning. The author might not have considered the immediate safety risks.\n\nThen there's the wife's reaction. She called the author an asshole, which suggests she disagrees. The author's intention was good, but the outcome was harmful. Did they have other options besides turning them away? Like involving other friends or family, or local resources?\n\nLegal and ethical aspects: Allowing someone to sleep at your house is a personal choice, but when someone is in crisis, there's a moral obligation to ensure their safety. The author might have failed to provide necessary support, leading to negative consequences.\n\nIn the end, while the author meant well, their actions lacked empathy and practical alternatives, which could justify them being in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
