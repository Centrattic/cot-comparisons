He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, crash at their house after his wife died. The situation is that Jake is really struggling, using sleeping pills, and ended up at the author's door in the middle of the night. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, leading to him sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can make people act in ways they wouldn't normally, and the author's friend is in a very vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help Jake get through his grief, but the outcome was negative. \n\nThe key points here are the author's decision and the consequences. Allowing the child but not the parent could be seen as conflicting, especially if the child was sleeping. Jake's actions (sleeping pills, being a mess) might indicate he needs more support. The author's wife called them an asshole, so there's some conflict in their household. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting a grieving friend is important. If the author could have offered a safe space for both Jake and his daughter, maybe that's the expected action. But the author might have thought forcing independence would help. However, causing immediate harm (sleeping on the streets, possibly more pills) could outweigh the intention. \n\nI should also think about the daughter. If Jake was taking care of her, the author's decision might have left the daughter in a worse situation, even if they allowed the child to stay. The author's approach might be well-meaning, but the result could be harmful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the balance between intent and outcome. The author might have believed they were helping, but the outcome was Jake being alone and possibly in danger. The daughter's safety is also a concern. The answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the action led to negative consequences despite good intentions. But maybe there are nuances, like the author not being able to take in adults, but allowing the child. Maybe the community might understand the intention but still criticize the method. \n\nI think the author's approach was misguided. Instead of pushing Jake to handle it on his own, offering temporary support could have been better. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets, which is unsafe, suggests the author's decision had unintended negative effects. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
