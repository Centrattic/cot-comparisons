He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is at fault for not letting their friend Jake stay overnight after his wife's death.\n\nFirst, the context: Jake is dealing with immense grief, his wife died, he's struggling with depression, and he's acting out. He shows up at the author's house with his daughter, asking for help. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. Jake then leaves and ends up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong in this situation. Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, the author might feel they're helping Jake by pushing him to cope, avoiding enabling his avoidance of grief. They might think he's not taking his healing seriously. On the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and refusing him shelter could be seen as not providing necessary support during a crisis. Also, the fact that Jake ended up on the streets complicates things\u2014maybe the author's refusal led to a worse outcome, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut the author's intention was to help him get over the loss. However, when someone is in severe emotional distress and potentially suicidal (he mentioned sleeping pills), the responsibility might be higher. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, which could be seen as splitting the family during a crisis. Also, the daughter's safety is a factor\u2014leaving her with Jake on the streets might be risky.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Jake's condition, the potential for self-harm, and the immediate safety concerns. Even if the author's intention was good, refusing shelter to someone in such a state might not be the right action, especially when there's a risk of harm. The author's wife is upset because she perceives it as cruel, and the outcome (sleeping on the streets) is worse. The author might not have considered all the consequences, but the immediate crisis situation requires support, not pushing for coping. So, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault, even if unintentionally.\n"
