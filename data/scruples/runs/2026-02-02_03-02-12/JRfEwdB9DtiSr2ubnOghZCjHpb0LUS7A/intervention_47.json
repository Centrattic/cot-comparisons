He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. The author didn't let Jake stay at his house, only allowing his daughter to sleep over. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a heavy burden, and Jake is in a very vulnerable state. He's dealing with depression, possibly considering suicide (since he mentioned taking sleeping pills), and is trying to care for his daughter. The author's reasoning was to help Jake by not letting him stay, thinking he needs to get over it. But is that the right approach?\n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good because the kid's safety is important. But Jake is in crisis. Even if the author wanted to push him to move on, he might not be in a state to handle being alone. People in deep grief might need support and structure. By not offering a safe space, the author might have inadvertently caused Jake to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. \n\nAlso, the friend's wife is upset with the author. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was harmful. Intentions matter, but so do actions and consequences. Even if the goal was to push Jake to heal, forcing him into a situation that could lead to harm might not be the right approach. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, empathy and immediate support are crucial. Maybe the author could have set boundaries but still offered help, like staying in the same house but with some structure. Or perhaps suggesting a shelter or other resources instead of turning him away. \n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to cause harm, the action of refusing Jake's request without providing alternatives might have been a mistake. The key is whether the author failed to provide necessary support during a critical time. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong despite good intentions.\n"
