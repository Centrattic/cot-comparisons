He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's really struggling, drinking a lot, and can't cope. The author, the narrator, refused to let Jake stay at their house, allowing only his daughter. Then Jake ended up on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider empathy here. Jake is going through a very traumatic time. His wife just died, and he's mentally unwell. The narrator's intention was to help him get through his grief, but the action of not letting him in might have been harsh. Even though they allowed the daughter, Jake's reaction was a glare and leaving. Then he went to the streets, which is dangerous and not a good outcome.\n\nThe narrator might think they're pushing Jake to be independent, but in reality, when someone is in a mental health crisis, they might need support, not abandonment. The fact that the daughter is there complicates things. The narrator could have provided a safe space for both, maybe with some conditions. Also, the wife called the narrator an asshole, which adds another perspective that the action was hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the narrator isn't obligated to let Jake stay, but they might have not considered the consequences. Maybe they thought Jake needed to face his grief, but ending up on the streets is a negative outcome. There's a balance between helping someone and letting go. The key here is whether the narrator's refusal was compassionate or not. If they refused out of a belief that Jake needs to handle it himself, but without providing alternatives, that's problematic.\n\nThe question is about whether the narrator is at fault. The answer depends on societal norms and expectations. Usually, in such scenarios, people are expected to offer support, especially to a close friend. Refusing without alternatives might be seen as neglecting the friend's mental health. The narrator's intention was good, but the execution was harmful. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because not providing shelter, especially with the daughter present, could be considered a failure to support a grieving friend, leading to negative consequences.\n"
