He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he ended up at the author's doorstep with his daughter. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake. The next day, Jake went back home, put the kid to sleep, and then slept on the streets. The author says their intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but the wife thinks they're an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about emotional support and boundaries. Jake is in a very vulnerable state. The author might be trying to push him to deal with the situation on his own, but maybe they didn't consider that Jake could be in a crisis point where he's not thinking clearly. \n\nAllowing the daughter to stay was compassionate, but refusing Jake might have been harsh. If Jake was in such a bad state that he's considering sleeping pills, the author's refusal could have pushed him to a point where he made a dangerous decision. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative\u2014Jake ended up on the streets. \n\nThe author might not have considered that Jake might not be in a rational state to care for himself or his daughter properly. There's a balance between setting boundaries and providing necessary support, especially when someone is grieving. The author's action, while maybe well-meaning, led to a worse situation. So, the author could be at fault here because their refusal might have inadvertently caused harm. \n\nBut then again, the author might argue they were trying to help Jake become independent. However, in a crisis, people might need more direct support. The author not offering help could be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend. The fact that Jake's daughter was involved adds another layer\u2014maybe the author should have thought of a safer alternative for both Jake and the child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their refusal, despite good intentions, led to a dangerous situation for Jake and his daughter. They didn't provide the necessary support a friend in such a dire situation might need.\n"
