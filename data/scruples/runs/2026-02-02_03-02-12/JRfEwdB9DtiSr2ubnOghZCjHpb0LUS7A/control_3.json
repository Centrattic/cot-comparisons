He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's best friend, Jake, whose wife died. Jake is struggling with depression, drinking, and can't handle being in his house. He shows up at the author's house late at night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter but not Jake, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're helping Jake by not letting him stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief. But Jake is in a vulnerable state, possibly with a mental health crisis. Allowing Jake to stay might provide temporary support, but the author's intention was to push him to cope. However, Jake's actions (sleeping pills, drinking) indicate he's not in a healthy state. The author's decision might be seen as cutting off support during a critical time. The daughter's safety is also a factor\u2014was the author responsible for Jake's actions? Maybe not directly, but allowing Jake to leave with the child could lead to problems.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have limits on how much they can help. They might be trying to avoid enabling Jake's avoidance behavior. But when someone is in a mental health crisis, especially after a significant loss, their judgment is impaired. The author's refusal might have pushed Jake to a breaking point, leading him to sleep on the streets. The daughter's well-being is also a concern if Jake is not fully capable of caring for her.\n\nThe author's intention matters. They didn't mean to put Jake on the streets, but their action had that consequence. However, they did allow the daughter to stay, which shows consideration. But Jake's mental state might affect his ability to care for the daughter properly. \n\nIn terms of social norms, offering a safe space to a grieving friend is common. However, the author might have valid reasons to set boundaries, especially if they can't handle the situation. The key is whether the author's action was inconsiderate or if it was a necessary boundary. Since Jake was already in a fragile state and the author's refusal led to a more dangerous situation, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not providing support when it was needed most. The daughter's safety is also a priority, so maybe the author should have allowed Jake to stay, at least temporarily, to ensure the child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision might be seen as harsh. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because denying support to someone in such a crisis, especially with a child involved, could be viewed as not being there when help is needed. The author's approach might not be the most compassionate, even if their intention was to help Jake cope.\n"
