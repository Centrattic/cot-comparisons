He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their best friend, Jake, showed up at their door with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. The friend then ended up on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend is dealing with the death of his wife and is struggling. The author felt he needed to help him move on, so he let the kid stay but not the friend. The friend took it badly and went to the streets.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want a second opinion. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nSo, the key points here: Is it right to refuse someone in crisis? The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house. But the consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets, which seems bad. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be trying to be supportive by encouraging Jake to face his environment. On the other hand, not allowing the friend to stay might have led to a worse situation. The friend has a child with him, so there's added responsibility. \n\nThe author allowed the child to stay, which is good, but not the father. Maybe the author thought that if the father is there, he might not be able to handle the child, or that the child's presence would help. But the friend's reaction was intense, and the outcome was negative. \n\nIs it fair to say the author was wrong? If the author knew that not letting Jake stay might lead to him being on the streets, maybe they should have found a different solution. But the author might not have realized the consequences. \n\nAlso, the wife criticized the author, which adds to the conflict. The author's intention was good, but the action might have been harmful. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, supporting someone through grief requires empathy and practical help. The author might have thought they were helping, but not allowing a place to stay could be seen as not providing necessary support. However, they did allow the child to stay, which shows they weren't completely dismissive. \n\nI think it's a tough call. The author's intention was positive, but the outcome was negative. The responsibility here is whether the action was reasonable. Maybe the author should have considered alternative solutions, like finding a hotel or a shelter, instead of just refusing. But the author might not have known where else to help. \n\nIn some cases, people in crisis need immediate support, and turning them away, even with good intentions, can have bad consequences. So, while the author's intention was to help, the execution might have been wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong). But others might argue B because the author tried to help in their own way. \n\nI need to decide based on the context. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets is a significant negative outcome. The author might have failed to provide necessary support. So the answer could be A.\n"
