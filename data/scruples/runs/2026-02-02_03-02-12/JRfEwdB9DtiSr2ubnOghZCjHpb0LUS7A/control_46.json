He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author (me) refused to let Jake stay overnight at their house, allowing only his daughter. Jake then slept on the streets. The wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's in deep grief and depression, possibly even considering suicide with the sleeping pills. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief. But is that realistic? Grief isn't something someone can just \"get over\" quickly. The author's action might be seen as cutting off support during a critical time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which shows they wanted to help the child. But Jake sleeping on the streets is dangerous, especially after taking pills. The author might be trying to encourage independence, but in a situation of severe mental health crisis, support is crucial. \n\nThe key points here are the immediate safety of Jake and his daughter. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The author didn't consider the possibility that Jake might not be stable enough to be alone. Also, there's a lack of alternative solutions\u2014maybe they could have found another place for him or involved other friends/family. The author's refusal might have been too harsh without proper support in place.\n\nSo, considering Jake's mental state and the potential for self-harm, the author's action, while well-intentioned, might not be the right approach. The answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because not allowing support in a crisis, even with good intentions, can be seen as neglecting the need for immediate help and safety.\n"
