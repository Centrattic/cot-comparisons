He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing his best friend to stay at his house after his wife's death. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died, and he's really struggling. He's been depressed, drinking a lot, and can't cope. The author, his best friend, was approached by Jake in the middle of the night with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake, thinking that Jake needs to get over it. Later, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author's wife found out and criticized him for. The author believes he wasn't wrong because his intention was to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state after a traumatic event. The author might have thought that by not letting Jake stay, he was pushing him to confront his grief. But on the other hand, refusing to help a friend in such a critical time could be seen as heartless. The daughter's presence complicates things because Jake can't care for her properly. The author let the daughter stay, which is good, but not allowing Jake might have led to him making a bad decision, like sleeping on the streets.\n\nI should consider the intent versus the outcome. The author's intention was to help, but the result was that Jake was left alone, leading to a dangerous situation. Even with good intentions, refusing support can have negative consequences. However, the author might not have realized the urgency of Jake's mental state. But still, in times of crisis, friends are expected to provide support, even if it's not perfect. Maybe the author could have allowed Jake to stay temporarily while setting boundaries, like getting help for him. \n\nAlso, the author's wife was upset, indicating that maybe the author didn't consider the immediate needs of his friend. The question is about being in the wrong. If the action led to harm, even unintentionally, the author might share some responsibility. However, the author's refusal was based on wanting to help Jake cope, not to abandon him. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The intent was good, but the execution may have been lacking. However, the answer depends on whether the refusal directly caused harm. Since Jake ended up on the streets, which is a serious outcome, maybe the author's decision to not offer support contributed to that. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted here. Another angle: the author allowed the daughter to stay, showing he wasn't entirely dismissive. But he didn't offer help beyond that. Maybe the right approach would have been to allow Jake to stay but encourage professional help. So the author's refusal to let Jake in might have been a mistake. Hence, the author is in the wrong.\n"
