He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife in a car crash. He's been struggling, becoming depressed, drinking, and taking sleeping pills. Jake's daughter is three years old. He approached the author and his wife at 1 AM, asking to stay because he couldn't handle his house. The author said the daughter could stay but not Jake. Jake left angry and later went to sleep on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're helping Jake by pushing him to deal with his grief.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about whether the author made the right decision. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him stay, but the result was Jake sleeping on the streets. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a severe emotional state, dealing with the loss of his wife. He's using sleeping pills, which is concerning. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Maybe the author thought that Jake needed to face his grief instead of avoiding it by staying elsewhere. But Jake's actions of going to sleep on the street after putting his daughter to sleep is a red flag. It shows he's in a vulnerable state.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by not enabling Jake to escape his home. On the other hand, by not letting Jake stay, they might have inadvertently caused him to end up in a dangerous situation. The author's wife called them a massive asshole, which suggests she thinks they were wrong. The author's intention was good, but the outcome was harmful.\n\nBut is the author responsible? They didn't force Jake out; they just said no to him staying. However, Jake's daughter is present, so maybe the author could have considered a different approach, like allowing both to stay temporarily or at least ensuring Jake had a safe place. The fact that Jake went to the streets after putting his daughter to sleep shows that he was in a bad mental state and the author's refusal might have pushed him to that point.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, sometimes actions have unintended consequences. If the author had a duty of care towards Jake, especially as a friend, maybe they should have been more accommodating. However, they might not have realized the severity of Jake's mental state. But given that Jake was already taking sleeping pills and was desperate, the author's refusal could have been the last straw leading to him sleeping outside.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to help, but the outcome is a factor. However, considering the result, it's possible that the author should have considered the immediate safety of Jake and his daughter more. Maybe there's a middle ground, like letting Jake stay temporarily while encouraging him to confront his grief later. Since Jake ended up in a dangerous situation, the author's decision might have contributed to that, making them at least partially responsible.\n\nBut I need to decide between A or B. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. But I'm leaning towards thinking that the author's refusal, while well-intentioned, had harmful consequences. So maybe the author is in the wrong. Wait, but they didn't know Jake would sleep on the streets. It's a tough call. If the author had a choice between letting him stay (which might help immediately) and pushing him to face his grief, but the outcome was worse, does that make them wrong?\n\nIn terms of intent vs. outcome. The author's intent was to help, but the outcome suggests they failed. However, in these situations, sometimes people can't foresee the consequences. But given that Jake was already in a fragile state, perhaps the author should have been more compassionate and allowed him to stay, offering support instead of pushing him away. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Another perspective: the author did allow the daughter to stay, which was a kind gesture. Maybe not letting Jake in was a mistake. So answer A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm still conflicted. Alternatively, if the author's intention was to help Jake by not letting him avoid his grief, maybe they are not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
