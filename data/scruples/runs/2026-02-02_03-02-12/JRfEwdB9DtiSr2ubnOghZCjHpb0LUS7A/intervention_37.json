He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense\u2014Jake is struggling with grief, depression, and even mentions taking sleeping pills. He showed up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not him. The author's reasoning was that Jake needed to get over his grief eventually. Now, the author is being called an asshole by their wife, but they feel they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects. Grief is a powerful emotion, and people's reactions can be unpredictable. Jake is in a vulnerable state, which might explain why he showed up in the middle of the night. The author's decision to let the daughter stay but not Jake could be seen as a way to support the child while pushing Jake to confront his grief. However, there's a line between helping someone heal and being cold-hearted. \n\nThe author's intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death, but by sending him away, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. That outcome might not have been the author's intention, but the method used to push Jake could be problematic. Grief counselor advice often suggests that people should be given space and support, not forced to face their grief alone. The author might not have considered that Jake needed immediate emotional support rather than a lesson in resilience.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that supporting Jake in his current state (drinking, sleeping pills) isn't helping him, and that pushing him to be independent is necessary for his long-term recovery. But the way it was handled\u2014refusing him entry and being abrupt\u2014could have been hurtful. Maybe there was a better way to set boundaries while still offering support, like discussing options with him or connecting him with professional help instead of just sending him away.\n\nAlso, the daughter's well-being is a factor. Letting the daughter stay was good, but Jake being on the streets puts the child at risk if he's not there to care for her. The author might have overlooked the potential consequences for the child by separating Jake from the daughter. That complicates the situation further.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They had good intentions but the execution might have been flawed. They could have handled it more compassionately. By not allowing Jake to stay and not providing an alternative, they might have contributed to his decision to sleep outside. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the intention was to help, the method was harsh and didn't consider the immediate needs and safety of both Jake and his daughter.\n"
