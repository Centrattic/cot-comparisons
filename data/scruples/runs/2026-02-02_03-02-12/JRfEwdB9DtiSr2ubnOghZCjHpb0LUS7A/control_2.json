He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He ended up at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay the night. The author said the daughter can stay but not Jake, thinking it's to help him get over his grief. But then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain, and his actions (drinking, sleeping pills, being homeless temporarily) show he's in a bad state. The author's intention was to push Jake to cope, but maybe they didn't consider his immediate needs. Allowing the daughter to stay but not the father seems contradictory. Jake's presence might help take care of the child, so by not letting him stay, the author might have left the child vulnerable if he left her to sleep outside.\n\nThe author says the intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death, but forcing him to be in his house, which triggers memories, might not be the best approach. Instead of helping him cope, the author's action led to a worse outcome. Also, the author's wife is upset, which suggests that maybe there's a lack of support for Jake in the household. \n\nAnother angle: the author might not have considered that Jake needed immediate emotional support and a safe place. By not allowing him to stay, they might have pushed him further into crisis. Even if the intention was good, the action didn't address the immediate problem of Jake's emotional state and the child's safety. \n\nI think the author's decision was not well-considered. While they wanted to help, refusing Jake's request without offering an alternative might have been harmful. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach didn't adequately address Jake's immediate needs and caused further harm.\n"
