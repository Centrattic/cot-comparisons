He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, is dealing with the death of his wife. He's really struggling, and after coming to their house late at night, the author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but refused to let Jake himself stay. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to face his grief and get over it, so they wanted to push him to stay in his own house. However, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions and the consequences. The author's intention was to help Jake by not enabling his avoidance of his home, which is a valid point. Grief can be overwhelming, and sometimes people need to confront their environment instead of escaping from it. But the action taken was to deny Jake a place to stay, which led to him being on the streets. That seems risky because Jake was already in a vulnerable state\u2014depressed, possibly under the influence of alcohol or pills. \n\nNow, ethical considerations: Is it wrong to prioritize someone's long-term healing over their immediate safety? On one hand, the author might think they're helping by not letting Jake escape. On the other hand, by not offering support, they might have left Jake in a dangerous situation. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but Jake's actions afterward could have been prevented if he had a safe place. \n\nAnother angle: the role of a best friend. Friends are supposed to be there in times of crisis. The author's decision might have been well-meanth, but the outcome was that Jake was left without a safe place, leading to sleeping on the streets. The wife is upset because she might see the author's action as cruel or neglectful. \n\nAlso, Jake was in a state where he was taking sleeping pills and had a young child. If the author had let him stay, they could have ensured both his and the child's safety. Denying Jake a place to stay might have been seen as not providing the necessary support during a critical time. \n\nI think the key points are: was the author's action proportionate to the situation? Did they have the right to make a decision that put Jake in potential danger? While the intention was to help, the result was harmful. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate consequences and didn't provide a safe alternative. The right choice might have been to let him stay but also have a conversation about his coping mechanisms.\n\nBut others might argue that pushing someone to face their grief is part of the healing process. However, the line between helping and harming is thin here. The author might not be in the wrong if they believed they were acting in Jake's best interest, but the outcome suggests that their action had negative consequences, which could imply they were wrong.\n"
