He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nJake's wife died recently, and he's struggling. He's depressed, drinking, sleeping a lot. He told the author he can't be in his house because of the memories and took sleeping pills. Then he showed up at their door with his daughter at 1 AM, asking to stay. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake. The next day, Jake went back, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The wife is upset, but the author thinks they're helping.\n\nSo, the key points are: Is the author's action of not letting Jake stay justified? On one hand, the author's intention was to help him get over his grief. But Jake's mental state is critical\u2014he's in a crisis, using pills, and ended up on the streets. The author's decision might have contributed to that, even if unintended. \n\nFrom a compassionate standpoint, a friend in severe emotional distress might need support, not a refusal. Even if the author had good intentions, refusing shelter without alternatives could be seen as harmful. Jake's actions after being turned away suggest he was in a vulnerable place. The author didn't provide an alternative solution, which might make their action more questionable. \n\nHowever, the author might argue they were trying to push Jake to move forward. But in cases of severe grief and potential self-harm, pushing might not be the right approach. The line between helping and hurting can be thin here. Since Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous, the author's decision could be seen as neglecting immediate needs for emotional growth. \n\nSo, considering the consequences and the immediate crisis, the author might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
