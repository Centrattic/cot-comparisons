Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent's daughter is 4 years old and goes to daycare. There's another kid, same age, who hugs and kisses her too forcefully. The daughter says it's uncomfortable and sometimes she yells at him to stop, but he doesn't. The parent tells the daughter it's okay to push him away if he's being violent and not stopping. The daughter worries he might push back, so the parent advises pushing back and running away or telling an adult. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong for encouraging any kind of violence, but the parent argues it's about using legitimate force in self-defense.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The main issue is whether telling a 4-year-old to push another child back is appropriate. On one hand, the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's causing her discomfort. Teaching self-defense in such a scenario might be seen as empowering the child to protect herself. The parent is emphasizing that if someone is using force and not stopping, it's okay to push back. However, the spouse is concerned about teaching a child to use violence at all, no matter the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the nature of the problem, and the parent's advice. At 4 years old, children are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child's behavior is described as \"violent\" hugging and kissing, which the daughter finds uncomfortable and which continues despite her protests. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping it, so the parent is trying to find a solution.\n\nUsing force to push away is a form of self-defense, but for a young child, teaching them to respond with physical resistance might escalate the situation. However, the parent is also advising to run away and tell an adult if needed, which adds a non-violent resolution step. The parent's approach is about immediate self-protection, while the spouse's approach focuses on non-violent solutions and relying on authority figures.\n\nAnother angle is the development of the child's understanding of conflict resolution. Physical responses might not be the most appropriate for a 4-year-old, especially since they might not have the judgment to assess when a situation is truly escalating. There's also the risk that the other child might react more aggressively if pushed. The daycare's role here is also important; maybe there's a need to address the other child's behavior more effectively through the daycare's systems or parents.\n\nBut given that the daycare hasn't resolved the issue and the child is experiencing distress, the parent's advice is intended to protect their daughter. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence is thin. The parent is specific about using \"legit force\" in a situation where the other child is being violent and not stopping. However, for a child that age, the ability to discern when force is appropriate might not be mature enough.\n\nIn some contexts, teaching children to set boundaries through verbal means is prioritized over physical responses. However, in cases where verbal methods fail and the child is genuinely in distress, the parent might feel justified in allowing physical resistance. The challenge is balancing immediate safety with long-term conflict resolution strategies.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're trying to protect their child from ongoing unwanted physical contact that the daycare hasn't addressed. However, there's also merit in the spouse's concern about teaching violence. Both have valid points, but the parent's intent was to protect their child in a situation where other methods haven't worked. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a middle ground where both non-violent and self-defense approaches are taught. But given the scenario as described, the parent's actions are a response to a specific problem their child is facing, so I'll go with B.\n"
