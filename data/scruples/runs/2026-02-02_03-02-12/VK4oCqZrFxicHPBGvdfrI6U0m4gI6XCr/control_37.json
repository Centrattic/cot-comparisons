Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed in a way that's making her uncomfortable by another kid at daycare. The parent tells her it's okay to push the kid away if he's being too forceful and won't stop even when she yells. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong because they should just report it to teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their ability to handle such situations might be limited. The parent is teaching their daughter to use physical force to protect herself when the other child isn't listening to her verbal protests. On one hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to stand up for herself, which is good. But on the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone might escalate the situation. The daughter is also worried that the other kid might push back, which the parent told her to push back or run away. \n\nThe daycare teachers aren't handling the issue effectively, so the parent is trying to give their child a way to handle it herself. However, encouraging physical retaliation, even if it's to stop unwanted contact, might not be the best approach for a child her age. At that age, kids don't always know how to de-escalate a physical confrontation, and it could lead to more conflict. Also, pushing someone could be seen as aggressive behavior, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because the daycare is supposed to handle such situations. But the problem is that the teachers aren't seeing it happen. The parent is trying to fill that gap. However, there's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. The parent mentions they are strict about not using violence, but this is a case of \"legit force.\" But the line is thin, especially with young children.\n\nIn child development, teaching a child to use physical force at such a young age might not be appropriate. They should be taught to use words, seek help, or remove themselves from the situation. The parent's advice might lead to the child being labeled as aggressive or escalate the conflict. Even though the other child is the one initiating the unwanted contact, the parent's solution might not be the most effective or safe.\n\nI think the parent is trying to protect their daughter but might be overstepping by endorsing physical confrontation. The correct approach would be reinforcing the child's communication with adults, maybe through role-playing or other non-physical means. So the parent might be in the wrong here, answer A.\n"
