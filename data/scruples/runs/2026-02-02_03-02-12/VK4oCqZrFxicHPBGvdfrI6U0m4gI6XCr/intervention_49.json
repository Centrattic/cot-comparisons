Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent says the child already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent advised pushing back or running away if needed.\n\nHmm. So, first, the situation involves a 4-year-old being physically forced into hugs and kisses by another child, which is making her uncomfortable. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but the spouse thinks it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, teaching a child to use physical force might set a bad precedent. But on the other hand, the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which could be a form of bullying. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when the system (teachers) isn't working.\n\nThe parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" only when necessary. The child is old enough to understand the difference between defending herself and using violence for no reason. The spouse's concern is that teaching any form of violence might encourage aggression. But the parent's approach is specific to situations where there's forced contact and the other child doesn't stop when told.\n\nAlso, the child is in a daycare where teachers aren't always present, so the parent is preparing her to handle immediate threats. The key is whether pushing away is a reasonable response. Hugging too hard can be harmful, especially if it's aggressive. The parent's advice seems to be about self-preservation and safety.\n\nI think the parent is trying to teach the child to recognize boundaries and defend herself when necessary. The spouse's approach relies on authority figures, but sometimes kids need to know how to protect themselves if they can't get help. The situation is about the child's safety and comfort. So, maybe the parent isn't wrong. They're teaching the child to prioritize her own safety and use physical force only when needed to stop unwanted contact. Therefore, answer B.\n"
