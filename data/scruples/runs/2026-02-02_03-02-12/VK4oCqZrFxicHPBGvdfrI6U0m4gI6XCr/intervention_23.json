Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent says the kid isn't stopping even after being told by adults, and the daughter tried telling the teachers but they didn't see it happen. The parent advised the daughter to push back or run and tell an adult if the kid doesn't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to only tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the situation. The child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. The child is 4, which is very young, so their understanding of boundaries is still developing. The parent's approach is to teach her self-defense in a non-violent way, like pushing away, not hitting or hurting. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence even if it's defensive.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, the parent isn't encouraging the child to use excessive force. They're teaching her to set boundaries and seek help. The key here is the concept of \"legit violence,\" which in this context is about defending oneself against unwanted, possibly harmful contact. The other child's behavior could be considered aggressive or inappropriate, and the parent is helping their daughter respond appropriately.\n\nHowever, the parent should also consider how a 4-year-old might interpret and act on that advice. The daughter was worried the other kid might push back. The parent's advice to push back again and run might be too much for a 4-year-old to handle, as the other child might be bigger or stronger. But the parent is also telling her to get help, which is the right step.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's point is that using any violence, even in self-defense, isn't ideal for a young child. The daycare's role is to manage interactions and enforce boundaries, so maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare more effectively. However, the teachers haven't been effective so far, so the parent is stepping in to protect their child.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their child's safety and autonomy. Teaching a child to recognize and respond to unwanted physical contact is important. The advice given is proportionate and includes seeking adult help, which is the best approach. The parent isn't promoting violence for aggression but for defense. So the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
