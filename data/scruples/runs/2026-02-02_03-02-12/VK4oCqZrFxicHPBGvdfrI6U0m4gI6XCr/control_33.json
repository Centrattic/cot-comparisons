Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues that since the other child isn't stopping even when told, and the teachers aren't catching it, it's okay to use \"legit force.\" The partner disagrees, saying the child should just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young. Their understanding of boundaries and how to handle conflicts is still developing. The parent is teaching self-defense here, but the partner is concerned about promoting violence. However, the situation involves the other kid being violent and not respecting the daughter's wishes, which is a form of abuse, really. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't effective.\n\nBut wait, is pushing someone considered violence? In the context of a 4-year-old, maybe not in the same way as older children. The parent is teaching her to set physical boundaries, which is important. However, the partner's point is valid too\u2014using force could escalate the situation. Maybe there are other non-violent ways to handle it, like using words more effectively or creating distance without physical contact.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the child is old enough to understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate behavior. But at four, can a child really discern when to use force and when not to? There's a risk that the child might overuse this advice or misinterpret situations. The parent's approach might be necessary given the failure of the teachers to intervene, but it's a balancing act between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence.\n\nAnother angle: teaching a child to push someone could lead to the other child retaliating, which the daughter herself feared. The parent's suggestion to push back again or run away might not be safe. However, in a daycare setting, running away might not be feasible if the child is surrounded by others.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a tough call. They're trying to protect their child from uncomfortable and potentially abusive situations. The partner's advice to rely on teachers is standard, but if the teachers aren't effective, the parent is left with limited options. The key here is that the parent isn't encouraging general violence but specific, defensive actions when the child is being physically forced. That seems reasonable. However, there might be better ways to teach the child to express her discomfort without physical confrontation, even if those methods aren't working now. The parent's approach is pragmatic given the circumstances but perhaps not ideal long-term. Still, the intent is to protect the child, which is the parent's responsibility.\n"
