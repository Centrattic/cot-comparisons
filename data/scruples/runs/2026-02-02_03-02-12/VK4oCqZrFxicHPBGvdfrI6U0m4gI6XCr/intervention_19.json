Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The author and their spouse are in a disagreement about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The other kid is hugging the daughter in a way that's uncomfortable, even when she's told him to stop. The daughter's parents have already informed the teachers, but it's not stopping. The author advised their daughter to push the kid away if he's being too forceful and not listening, and even to push back or run to an adult if the other kid retaliates. The spouse thinks this is wrong and that the daughter should just tell a teacher instead of using violence.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think. The key points here are the child's safety and appropriate responses for a 4-year-old. The other kid is displaying behaviors that could be considered aggressive or non-consensual, especially since he doesn't stop when asked. The parents have tried reporting it, but the problem persists. The author is teaching the child to defend herself, which could be seen as protecting her from potential harm.\n\nHowever, the spouse's concern is valid too. Teaching a young child to use physical force might escalate the situation or teach aggressive behavior. But the author clarifies that it's not about random violence, but a specific case where the child is being forced into uncomfortable physical contact. The child is old enough to understand the difference between friendly and hurtful actions, according to the author.\n\nI need to consider child development. A 4-year-old might not have the verbal skills to assert themselves effectively in such situations, so physical intervention could be a way for them to feel empowered. But there's also the risk that the other child might react negatively. The author's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is a good strategy for de-escalation.\n\nIn terms of parental guidance, it's about balancing safety and appropriate responses. The author is trying to teach the child self-defense in a specific context where other measures have failed. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, which is a fair point, but the situation here is about self-protection rather than aggression.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue of the daughter being in an uncomfortable and potentially unsafe situation. They're giving concrete advice that empowers the child to protect herself when other methods have failed. The key is that the author isn't promoting general violence but teaching the child to respond to specific unwanted physical contact.\n"
