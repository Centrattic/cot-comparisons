Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The daughter tried telling the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is teaching their child to defend herself by pushing back if the other kid doesn't stop, which is a form of self-defense.\n\nThe parent's partner disagrees, saying it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence. The parent argues that it's about using legitimate force in a violent situation. The key here is the age of the child\u20144 years old. At that age, kids might not have the verbal skills or the ability to navigate social boundaries effectively on their own. \n\nBut the parent is teaching the child to recognize when something is uncomfortable and how to respond. However, some might argue that even at 4, encouraging physical resistance could lead to more aggression or conflict. Also, in a daycare setting, there's supposed to be supervision, so maybe the solution is more about the daycare's responsibility to intervene when they see the behavior. \n\nAnother angle is that the parent is trying to empower the child to set boundaries, which is a good thing. But the daycare might have protocols in place, and maybe the parent should involve the daycare more actively instead of teaching the child to handle it physically. However, the daycare isn't seeing the behavior when they try to intervene, so maybe their approach isn't effective.\n\nI think the parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable or potentially harmful situations. While the partner is concerned about promoting violence, the parent is teaching the child self-defense in a specific context where the other child isn't respecting personal space. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence is thin here. \n\nGiven that the parent is not advocating for general violence but specific, defensive actions, and the child is in a situation where the usual authority figures (teachers) aren't effective, the parent's approach might be justified. However, there's also a risk that the child might escalate the situation or use the advice inappropriately. \n\nSo, weighing the options, the parent's intention is protective, but the method might not be the best. However, considering the daycare's inaction, the parent's actions could be seen as necessary. The answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue their child is facing, even if the approach isn't perfect.\n"
