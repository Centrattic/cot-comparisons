Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable, even after she's asked the other child to stop. The parent argues that this is a form of \"legit violence\" and that the child should defend herself. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, considering the age of the kids, 4 years old, they're still developing social skills and understanding boundaries. The daycare teachers have already been informed, but they might not catch the incidents because they happen quickly. The parent's concern is valid because the child is experiencing unwanted physical contact, which could be a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior. The parent wants to empower their daughter to protect herself, which can be important for self-defense and setting boundaries.\n\nHowever, the spouse's point isn't without merit. Teaching a child to respond with physical force could escalate the situation, as the daughter worried about the other child pushing back. There's also the aspect of non-violent conflict resolution, which is a key part of social development. At 4, kids are learning to communicate and use words, so maybe encouraging the daughter to express her discomfort more clearly or seek help from adults is better. The daycare's role is crucial here, so relying on them first makes sense. But if the teachers aren't effective, the parent has to find another way to protect their child.\n\nThe parent's approach might be seen as teaching the child to use force, which could conflict with their overall values of avoiding violence. However, the situation here is about self-defense in a specific context. The parent isn't advocating for general violence but a response to persistent, unwanted physical contact. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence is thin here. It's a balance between protecting the child and teaching appropriate social responses.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, teaching a child to push someone in self-defense might be considered acceptable to prevent harm. But the alternative is to focus on communication and adult intervention. The parent's advice could be seen as necessary given the failure of the teachers to address the issue. However, the potential for escalation is a valid concern from the spouse's perspective. It's possible that the daycare's inaction is part of the problem, so the parent is trying to fill that gap. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're trying to protect their child from unwanted contact. On the other, they're introducing physical confrontation. But given the context\u2014persistent behavior that the child can't stop by other means\u2014it could be justified as self-defense. The key is whether the teaching is about defending oneself in a specific, non-aggressive way. The parent isn't encouraging unprovoked violence, just a response to ongoing abuse. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are elements where A could be argued if the approach is seen as promoting violence over communication.\n"
