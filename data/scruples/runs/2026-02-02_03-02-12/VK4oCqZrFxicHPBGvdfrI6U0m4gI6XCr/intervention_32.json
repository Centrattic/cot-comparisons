Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who advised their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her violently is in the wrong. The situation involves a daycare child who's being too forceful with hugs and kisses, and despite the teachers not noticing, the parent encourages the daughter to push back if needed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the child's safety and autonomy. The other kid is engaging in behavior that's making the daughter uncomfortable, even when she tells him to stop. The parent is teaching her to protect herself, which is a common approach to self-defense. But the spouse is concerned that using any form of violence, even defensive, sets a bad example.\n\nThe parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" in a situation where someone is being violent. They also mention that they emphasize not using violence otherwise. The question is whether this advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to stand up for themselves and protect their personal space is important. It's about teaching boundaries and self-advocacy. On the other hand, there's the risk that even pushing could escalate the situation, especially if the other child is aggressive. Also, the child's age is very young; 4 years old might not fully grasp the nuances of when it's okay to use force versus when it's not.\n\nAnother angle is the role of adults in these situations. The teachers aren't addressing the behavior, so the parent is stepping in as a substitute. However, the child might not be in a position to handle the escalation on her own. The spouse's point about reporting to teachers is valid, but if that's not effective, the parent's intervention is necessary.\n\nI think the parent is trying to balance teaching self-defense with not promoting aggression. The advice to push back is specific to the situation where the other child is being violent, not for general use. The parent also adds the option to run away and tell an adult, which is a good safety measure. So, the parent's intention is to protect their child, which is a priority. However, the concern is whether a 4-year-old is mature enough to handle this advice without misapplying it.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns, the parent's main goal is to protect their child's well-being, which is a parent's duty. The approach might have risks, but it's rooted in teaching her to defend herself when others don't intervene. So, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
