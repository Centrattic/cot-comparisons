Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too hard and kissed by another kid at daycare. The parent told her it's okay to push him away, and even to push back if needed. The spouse is upset, thinking they should just tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is really young, so their understanding of boundaries and how to handle uncomfortable situations is developing. The parent's advice is about using physical force to stop unwanted contact, which is a form of self-defense. But is that appropriate for a 4-year-old?\n\nThe daycare teachers are involved, but they haven't been able to stop the other child's behavior. The parent might be frustrated because the problem isn't being resolved through the usual channels. But teaching a child to use force might escalate the situation. Kids at that age don't always understand the consequences of their actions. If the daughter pushes back, the other kid might retaliate, leading to a bigger problem. Also, the daycare might have specific policies on physical interactions between children, and the parent's advice could conflict with that.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from feeling uncomfortable or unsafe. The other child is being overly forceful and not respecting boundaries. The parent's advice is about using \"legit force\" in a situation where the boundaries are being crossed. However, teaching a young child to use physical force as a first response might not be the best approach. It's possible that the daughter should be taught other ways to handle it, like using words more effectively, moving away, or immediately seeking help from a teacher even if the initial report didn't work.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, could set a bad precedent. The child might start to see violence as an acceptable way to solve problems. Also, at daycare, there might be strict rules against any kind of physical contact between children, so even if the intent is good, the method might not be appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the child's age. A 4-year-old might not have the emotional maturity to assess when it's appropriate to push back and when it's not. There's a risk she might overreact or use more force than necessary. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself, but maybe there are other strategies that are safer and more age-appropriate.\n\nIn terms of child development, social skills and conflict resolution are important. The parent's approach might prioritize immediate safety, while the spouse's approach focuses on teaching non-violent solutions. The daycare's role is also a factor here. If the teachers are not addressing the issue, maybe the parent should escalate the problem to the daycare management rather than advising the child to handle it physically.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because even though the intention is to protect the child, the method of teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could be harmful in the long run. It's possible that there are better strategies that align with the daycare's policies and promote non-violent conflict resolution. The spouse's perspective of relying on adults (teachers) and avoiding violence is more in line with standard child-rearing advice for young children.\n"
