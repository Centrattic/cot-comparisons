Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging too forcefully and kissing her. The parent's spouse disagrees, thinking the kid should just tell a teacher and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is being physically uncomfortable by another child. The parent's advice is about self-defense, teaching their daughter to push back if she's being forced and can't get help otherwise. The spouse is against any use of violence, even in defense.\n\nAt 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries. The other child's behavior is aggressive and not respecting the daughter's personal space. The teachers aren't handling it effectively, so the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself.\n\nThe key here is whether teaching a child to use physical force in such a situation is appropriate. Generally, for young children, the advice is to teach them to say \"no,\" remove themselves, and tell an adult. However, when the child can't get the other to stop even when saying \"no,\" and the adults aren't helping, the parent might feel the need to teach self-defense basics.\n\nBut there's a risk. Encouraging a child to push back might escalate the situation. The parent argues that it's \"legit force,\" but is a 4-year-old capable of using force appropriately without it becoming a fight? Also, the spouse is concerned about promoting violence, even for defense.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological impact. Teaching a child to handle it themselves might conflict with teaching non-violence. However, the parent is emphasizing that it's okay to defend herself when being hurt and the system isn't working.\n\nIn some cases, teaching children to set physical boundaries is important. But the method of pushing back might not be the best approach. Alternative strategies, like using a firm \"no\" with an action (like stepping back), might be safer. The parent's advice could be seen as well-intentioned but perhaps too direct for a young child.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. They're trying to protect their child, but the method could be problematic. Maybe the answer is A (yes) because it's promoting violence, even if minimal. Or B (no) because it's about self-defense in a situation where other methods have failed. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression is thin here.\n"
