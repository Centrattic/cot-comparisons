Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another child who's hugging her too roughly and not stopping even when she yells. The parent's partner disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is exhibiting behaviors that are uncomfortable and possibly inappropriate\u2014forceful hugging, kissing, not respecting the daughter's protests. The teachers haven't been effective in stopping it. The parent taught their daughter to use force to defend herself if needed. The partner is concerned about encouraging violence.\n\nAt four years old, children are learning boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent's approach emphasizes self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting personal space and is being aggressive. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for the situation. Pushing away to stop immediate harm might be seen as a reasonable self-defense action by a young child, especially when other methods (telling adults) haven't worked.\n\nHowever, using force can be a concern. Teaching a child to use physical force could lead to escalation or unintended consequences. The partner's point about reporting to teachers first is valid because it's a non-violent solution. But in cases where the child is being harmed and the adults aren't effective, the parent might feel it's necessary to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nI also need to think about child development. A 4-year-old may not have the emotional maturity to handle such situations without guidance. The parent is trying to teach the daughter to recognize when something is wrong and take action. However, there's a risk that the child could misinterpret the message and use force inappropriately.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical perspective. In many contexts, self-defense is justified when there's an immediate threat. If the other child's behavior is considered violent or harmful, then the daughter's response could be seen as a legitimate act of self-protection.\n\nBut the line is thin. Encouraging a child to push someone else might be seen as promoting aggression. The parent might be overstepping by not relying on the daycare's systems to handle the issue. It's possible the daycare isn't doing enough, but the parent's solution involves direct action.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is to protect their child, which is a natural instinct. However, the method of teaching a young child to use force could be problematic. The partner's concern is about promoting non-violence. The answer might hinge on whether the situation qualifies as legitimate self-defense for a child, considering the context and the effectiveness of other measures.\n"
