Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's being too forceful with hugs and kisses. The kid doesn't stop even when she yells, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent argues it's \"legit force\" to stop unwanted violence, while the SO thinks it's better to just tell a teacher and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 4-year-old. That's very young. Kids at that age are learning boundaries and appropriate social interactions. The other child is acting in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable, even to the point of being violent. The parent is trying to teach their daughter how to protect herself. But is physical resistance the right approach here?\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that if someone is hurting her and won't stop despite being told, pushing back is acceptable. The parent mentions they're generally against violence, but this is a specific case of defense. The SO's concern is about encouraging any form of violence in a child, even if it's self-defense. \n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to recognize when they're in danger and to take action could be empowering. It's about self-defense and understanding personal boundaries. On the other hand, a 4-year-old might not fully grasp the concept of proportionality. Pushing back could escalate the situation, leading to more conflict or injury. Also, daycare staff are supposed to manage such interactions, so relying on adults might be the safer route.\n\nThere's also the aspect of modeling behavior. If the parent is okay with using force in this scenario, does that set a precedent for other situations where a child might act out? The parent argues that the daughter is old enough to understand the difference, but at 4, cognitive development is still very young. The child might not differentiate between self-defense and just aggression.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare's role is to handle these interactions. If the daughter starts pushing the other child, the daycare might handle it as a behavioral issue, not understanding the context. This could lead to mislabeling the daughter as aggressive, which could affect her social standing in daycare.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact on the daughter. If she gets into a fight, she might feel guilty or scared. The parent wants her to feel empowered, but the child's emotional well-being is also a factor. The parent's solution includes running away and telling an adult, which is a good strategy, but the initial instruction to push back might not be the best first step.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical considerations, parents have a duty to protect their children. If the other child's actions are indeed violent, the parent is trying to equip their daughter with tools to protect herself. However, daycare policies might have strict rules against children initiating physical contact, so encouraging that could conflict with their guidelines.\n\nChild development experts often recommend that young children be guided to use words and seek help from adults rather than using physical force. The parent's approach might be seen as instigating a cycle of violence, which could be detrimental in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the method might not be the most appropriate for a 4-year-old. The SO's concern about avoiding violence and relying on adults is valid. The parent might be in the wrong because the solution could escalate the problem and doesn't align with standard child-rearing advice for that age.\n"
