Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The parent says the child already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The SO thinks the parent was wrong to encourage using force instead of just telling the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being forceful, not respecting boundaries. The parent is teaching their daughter to protect herself, which seems reasonable. But teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate things. However, the parent emphasizes using legit force, not violence. They also mention teaching her to run away and tell an adult if needed.\n\nThe other parent's concern is about using violence at all, but in this case, the parent is addressing a specific situation where the child is being physically forced. Teaching self-defense in such scenarios is a common approach to help a child protect themselves. The parent also mentions that the child might get hurt if she doesn't push back, so they're preparing her for that possibility.\n\nI should check if there are any guidelines or common parental advice on this. Usually, parents are advised to teach children to set boundaries, use their voice, and seek help. But in cases where verbal communication isn't effective, physical means might be necessary. However, the parent here is not teaching the child to attack, but to defend herself in a specific context. They also emphasize continuing to tell an adult, which is good because it's important to report the behavior.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's response is appropriate given the child's age and the situation. Encouraging a 4-year-old to push someone away could be seen as teaching her to use physical force, which might not be ideal in a daycare setting. However, given that the other child isn't stopping and the teachers aren't effective, the parent's advice is about self-protection. \n\nI think the parent is trying to balance teaching self-defense with non-violence. They're not promoting general violence but addressing a specific issue where the child needs to protect herself. The spouse's concern is valid but the parent's approach might be necessary in this context. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're helping their daughter set boundaries and protect herself when verbal methods fail.\n"
