Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being overly hugging and kissing them. The parent and their spouse disagree on this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged and kissed in a way that's uncomfortable. The parent is advising their daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running away if the other child retaliates. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong to teach this, preferring to tell teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nSo, what's the right approach here? At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to communicate their feelings. The parent's approach is about self-defense, empowering the child to protect themselves in the moment. However, the spouse's approach relies on adults to intervene, which might not always happen effectively, as the teachers didn't manage the situation well.\n\nBut, there's a risk in teaching a young child to use physical force. They might not understand how to apply it appropriately, or it could escalate into a bigger conflict. However, the parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" as a last resort when the other child ignores the child's attempts to stop.\n\nDevelopmentally, 4-year-olds can understand basic concepts of personal space and saying no. But physically pushing someone might be seen as aggressive, even if it's defensive. The daycare's role is crucial here. If the teachers aren't addressing the issue, maybe the parent should escalate the problem to the daycare management instead.\n\nAnother angle: the child's autonomy. Teaching her to advocate for herself is important. However, the method of doing so could be debated. Maybe the parent could have taught non-violent ways first, like saying \"no\" loudly, using their voice, or moving away. If the other child doesn't respond, then maybe physical action is justified. \n\nAlso, the parent's response when the daughter was worried about retaliation is valid. Telling her to push back again and run away seems to be about self-defense, which is reasonable. However, teaching a child to fight back could be problematic if it leads to cycles of aggression or if the daycare has strict no-physical-contact policies.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is to protect their child, which is understandable. But the approach might be too aggressive for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about not encouraging violence is valid. The correct answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because the solution involves teaching physical confrontation, which isn't ideal for young children. However, there's also a case for the parent being right in teaching self-defense. It depends on the context of the daycare's policies and the child's ability to discern when it's appropriate to push back.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a yes or no (A or B), I need to make a judgment. The parent's advice is to use force, which is a form of violence, even if it's defensive. For a 4-year-old, it's safer to teach non-violent self-advocacy and ensure the daycare is properly addressing the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because encouraging a child to use physical force against another, even if justified, isn't the best approach for that age.\n"
