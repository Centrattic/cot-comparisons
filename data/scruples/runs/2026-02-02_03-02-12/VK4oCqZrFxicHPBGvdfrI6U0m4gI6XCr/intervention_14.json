Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop even after she yells, and to run away or tell an adult if the other kid pushes back. The spouse is upset, thinking it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact by another kid. The teachers aren't catching it, and the other kid isn't stopping. The parent is teaching their daughter to defend herself without using excessive force. At 4 years old, the child might not have the language or confidence to stop the behavior, so physical push away could be a way to set a boundary.\n\nBut there's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. However, in this case, the parent is saying it's okay to push away when someone is being violent. That seems like teaching the child to protect herself from unwanted aggression. The parent also mentions that their child is taught not to use violence otherwise, so this is a specific situation.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about using any violence, but the parent argues it's legitimate force in self-defense. The child is being taught to recognize when someone is forcing contact and to respond proportionally. The parent is also advising to run away or tell an adult if there's retaliation, which adds a layer of safety.\n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves from harmful behavior can be justified, especially when adults aren't intervening. The key is that the response is proportionate. Pushing away isn't an attack; it's a way to remove the threat. At 4, children don't have the same judgment as adults, so the parent is providing a practical solution when other methods (talking, teachers) aren't working.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to more aggression. But given the context of the other child's behavior being aggressive and non-consensual, the parent is teaching the child to protect their own space. It's about consent and bodily autonomy, which are important concepts to introduce early.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's approach seems reasonable. They're not promoting violence for fun but teaching a necessary self-defense technique in a specific scenario. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
