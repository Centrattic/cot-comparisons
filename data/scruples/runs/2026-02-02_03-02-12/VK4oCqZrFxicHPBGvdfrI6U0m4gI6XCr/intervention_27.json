Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid is at fault. The situation involves a child who's being hugged too hard and even kissed by another kid despite trying to stop it. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid doesn't stop, and maybe run away. The spouse disagrees, thinking they should only report to teachers. The parent argues it's about legitimate force in a violent situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young. Teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might be tricky. But the other child is being forceful and not respecting boundaries. The parent is trying to teach the daughter to protect herself. However, promoting physical responses at such a young age could set a precedent for using violence in conflicts, which might not be ideal. \n\nOn the other hand, the other child's behavior is inappropriate and the teachers aren't effective. The parent is trying to empower the child to set boundaries. But maybe there are better ways to handle it, like reinforcing communication with the teachers, maybe more involvement from the daycare, or even discussing the situation with the other child's parents. \n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use violence can have long-term effects. However, the parent's reasoning is about protecting the child in a specific instance of non-consensual contact. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing away is a minimal form of force, and the parent isn't advocating for aggression but for self-defense. \n\nIn child development, teaching children to recognize and assert their boundaries is important. However, at four years old, the child might not fully understand the nuances of when it's appropriate to use physical force. The daycare's role is also a factor. If the staff isn't addressing the issue, maybe the parent should escalate the matter to the daycare management, not just rely on the child's self-defense. \n\nBut the parent's advice isn't about escalating to a fight; it's about immediate self-protection. The alternative of only relying on reporting might not work if the teachers aren't effective. The parent is trying to cover both bases: teaching the child to protect herself and advising to seek adult help. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the parent is trying to protect their child from an uncomfortable and potentially harmful situation. While the method involves physical action, it's in the context of a specific, non-aggressive response to unwanted force. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
