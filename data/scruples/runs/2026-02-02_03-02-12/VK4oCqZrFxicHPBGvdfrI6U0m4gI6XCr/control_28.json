Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too roughly and not respecting her when she says no. The parent and their SO are arguing about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being persistent and forceful, which is making the daughter uncomfortable. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not helping. The parent is advising the child to push back if she feels violated. The SO argues that the child should only tell the teachers and not use violence. \n\nNow, I need to think about what's appropriate for a 4-year-old. At that age, kids don't have the emotional maturity to handle such situations on their own. Pushing back might escalate things, and the parent is teaching the child to use force, which could lead to more conflict. Also, in a daycare setting, teachers are responsible for managing interactions between children. The parent might be overstepping by giving the child a \"defensive\" strategy instead of relying on the daycare staff to handle it.\n\nHowever, the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact. It's important for the daughter to understand her boundaries. But the method of teaching her to push back might not be the best approach. Instead of encouraging physical response, the parent could focus on other strategies like teaching the child to clearly say \"no\" or to move away, and to immediately tell an adult each time it happens. The daycare should be more proactive in addressing the behavior of the other child if they're aware of it.\n\nSo, the parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method of teaching the child to use force could be problematic. It's possible that the parent is contributing to the problem by encouraging a physical response, which isn't appropriate for a 4-year-old and could lead to more issues in the daycare. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not relying enough on the daycare's responsibility to manage such situations and for teaching a violent solution.\n"
