Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's being too forceful in hugging and kissing her. The husband disagrees, saying she should report it instead of using force.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The daycare teachers aren't addressing it effectively. The parent's advice is to use force to protect herself, which the husband thinks is wrong.\n\nI need to consider child development here. At 4 years old, kids don't have the emotional maturity to handle such situations. Teaching a child to push back might escalate the conflict or teach them that violence is a solution, which isn't ideal. Also, the daycare setting requires adults to manage these interactions, so maybe the parent should focus on involving the teachers more actively instead of giving the child a way to retaliate.\n\nBut the parent also has a valid point about their daughter's autonomy. Teaching her to assert herself is important, but the method might be inappropriate. Pushing could be seen as encouraging aggression, even if it's self-defense. The line between self-defense and initiating violence is blurry here, especially with kids.\n\nThe husband's stance is about non-violence and relying on adults. That's a common parenting approach. However, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't intervening. It's a tricky balance. Maybe the parent should have discussed other strategies, like verbally asserting herself or seeking help again immediately if the first report didn't work.\n\nIn terms of child safety, any form of unwanted contact that's not respecting the child's wishes is a concern. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter, but the method might not be the best. So, while the parent's concern is valid, advising physical resistance might not be the right approach. The answer might lean towards AITA (they are the wrong) because promoting violence, even in self-defense, at such a young age can have unintended consequences. The solution should involve more collaboration with the daycare and maybe involving the other child's parents if the situation isn't resolved.\n"
