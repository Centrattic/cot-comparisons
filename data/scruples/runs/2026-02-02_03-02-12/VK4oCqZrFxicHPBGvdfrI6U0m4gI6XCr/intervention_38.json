Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The author, the parent, told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too rough, even if the child might retaliate. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to only tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle uncomfortable situations. The other child's behavior is clearly making the daughter uncomfortable, even if it's not physical aggression per se. The daycare staff isn't effectively addressing it, so the parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself.\n\nThe parent's advice is to use \"legit violence\" as a last resort when the other child won't stop despite the daughter's protests. They emphasized that it's okay to push back if necessary, but also to run away and tell an adult. The spouse argues that any violence, even in self-defense, should be avoided and that the daughter should only report it to teachers.\n\nI need to weigh the merits of each approach. On one hand, teaching a child to stand up for themselves is important, especially when the authority figures (teachers) aren't effective. The parent is trying to ensure the daughter's safety and comfort, which makes sense. On the other hand, encouraging physical retaliation could escalate the situation and teach the daughter that violence is an acceptable solution, which might not be ideal for her development.\n\nHowever, the key here is the context: the other child is persistently engaging in unwanted, forceful behavior that the daughter finds uncomfortable. The parent isn't teaching her to initiate violence but to defend herself in a situation where she's being pressured physically. The advice includes options like pushing away and running to an adult, which is a balanced approach.\n\nThe spouse's concern about avoiding all violence is valid, but the parent's approach is about setting boundaries and self-defense, not starting a fight. The daughter is being taught to recognize her right to say no and protect herself, which is a fundamental life skill. Since the daycare isn't resolving the issue, giving the daughter tools to handle it when adults aren't watching seems reasonable.\n\nSo, considering the parent's intent to protect their child's well-being and the specific circumstances where the other child's actions are unwanted and persistent, it seems the parent is not in the wrong. They're providing practical self-defense advice in a situation where reporting alone hasn't worked. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
