Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging her violently is in the wrong. The parent is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The answer options are A for yes (they're wrong) and B for no (they're not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The child is in daycare, and another kid, same age, is hugging her too hard, sometimes kissing her, despite her yelling for him to stop. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away if he's being too forceful. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit violence\" to stop unwanted force. The spouse disagrees, thinking the child should only tell a teacher and not use violence.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force to defend herself is appropriate. Let's break this down.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, 4-year-olds are still learning social skills and boundaries. They might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The parent is addressing a real problem: the other child is being aggressive, and the daycare staff isn't effectively stopping it. The parent wants their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, teaching a young child to use physical force even in self-defense could have downsides. It might escalate the situation, leading to more conflict between the kids. Also, the parent's approach might model aggression as a solution to problems, which could influence the child's behavior in other contexts. But the parent clarifies they're not advocating for violence in general but specific instances where the child is being hurt.\n\nThe spouse's concern is that the child should rely on adults to resolve the issue instead of using violence. There's merit here because daycare staff should handle such situations. However, in this case, the staff isn't seeing the incidents and the other child isn't listening to them. So, the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself when the system isn't working.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspect. If a child is being physically forced in a way that causes discomfort or harm, the parent might be right in teaching self-protection. But there's also the risk of the child overreacting or using excessive force. However, the parent's instruction seems measured\u2014pushing back only when necessary and then telling an adult. The child is also advised to run and tell an adult if things escalate, which is a good safety measure.\n\nCulturally and socially, there's a debate about when it's appropriate for children to use physical force. Some argue that children should express their discomfort without aggression, while others believe that teaching self-defense is important. The parent's approach seems to be a middle ground\u2014using force only when necessary to stop immediate harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a valid concern about encouraging physical confrontation, the parent is responding to a real issue where the daycare isn't providing enough protection. Teaching the child to assert her boundaries physically in this specific context might be justified. However, there's also a risk that this could lead to more conflict. But given the circumstances, the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, which is a primary responsibility. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), considering the parent's intent and the lack of effective intervention from the daycare.\n"
