Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her, even after she tells him to stop. The parent argues that it's legitimate violence in self-defense, while the spouse thinks she should rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. A 4-year-old might not grasp the concept of boundaries and force in the same way an adult does. The parent is teaching the child to protect herself, which is a good intention, but the method might be problematic. Physical retaliation, even if it's just pushing, could escalate the situation. At that age, kids don't have the maturity to handle conflict without it getting worse. Also, teaching a child to use force might set a precedent for aggressive behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the other child's actions are indeed inappropriate and potentially harmful. The daycare staff isn't effectively addressing the issue, so the parent wants to empower their daughter to defend herself. But is pushing considered a legitimate form of self-defense for a 4-year-old? Maybe not, because it's more about immediate reaction rather than a measured response. The parent's advice might be more about immediate self-protection, but the spouse is right in that involving adults is a better long-term solution.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they're strict about not using violence otherwise, so this is a specific case. However, teaching a child to push someone away could be seen as encouraging violence, even if it's justified. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old's development. The child is still learning how to communicate and resolve conflicts, so maybe the better approach is to reinforce non-violent methods, like clearly saying \"no\" and seeking help from adults, instead of physical means. The parent's solution might be too soon for a child of that age to handle safely.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because they're teaching a child to use physical force as a first response, which could lead to more issues. The spouse's approach of relying on teachers is more in line with developmental appropriateness and conflict resolution strategies for young children.\n"
