Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is wondering if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The daughter already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent argues that it's okay to use \"legit violence\" in self-defense, while the SO thinks they should focus on telling adults instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent's advice is about self-defense, but even at that age, teaching a child to push someone might escalate the situation. The other child is also 4, so both are young. The parent might be right in that the daughter has a right to protect herself, but the method used could be a problem. Pushing could lead to more aggression, as the daughter herself mentioned the other kid might push back.\n\nThen there's the aspect of teaching non-violent resolution. The SO's point is that telling a teacher is better. The daughter already tried that, but the teachers didn't catch it. Maybe there's a need for more consistent communication with the daycare, not just from the child's side. Also, at 4, children don't have the emotional maturity to de-escalate a situation through physical means. Pushing might not be the best strategy; other options like moving away or using words could be safer.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical side. Teaching a child to use force even in self-defense might be seen as promoting violence. But the parent is framing it as necessary to stop ongoing unwanted contact. However, for a 4-year-old, the line between self-defense and initiating violence is very thin. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such interactions, so maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare more effectively, like having a meeting with the teachers and the other child's parents if possible.\n\nAlso, the daughter's fear of the other kid pushing back shows that she's aware of potential escalation. Teaching a child to push might not address the root issue, which is the other child's behavior, and could lead to cycles of aggression between the kids. The parent's advice is well-intentioned but might not be developmentally appropriate. At that age, the best approach might be to reinforce communication with trusted adults and teach the child to remove herself from the situation, perhaps using clear \"no\" and walking away, rather than physical confrontation.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the advice given might not be the most effective or safe. The focus should be on non-violent strategies and ensuring the daycare is properly addressing the issue. So the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical action over other solutions.\n"
