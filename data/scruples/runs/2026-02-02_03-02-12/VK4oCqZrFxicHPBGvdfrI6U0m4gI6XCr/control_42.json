Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and making her uncomfortable. The spouse says it's wrong, but the parent argues it's about using necessary force when the child is being hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is a same-age child who's hugging/kissing her too hard, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent is teaching the daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop. The spouse thinks the parent is encouraging violence, but the parent says it's about self-defense.\n\nNow, the key points here: when is it appropriate for a child to use physical force? For a 4-year-old, the guidance should be about teaching them to recognize when something is uncomfortable and to tell an adult. Physical responses might escalate the situation, especially with young kids who might not understand boundaries. Also, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to differentiate between necessary and unnecessary force. Pushing could lead to a fight or the other child getting hurt, which might not be the best solution.\n\nThe parent's approach could be seen as protecting their child's autonomy, which is important. However, teaching a child to use physical force from an early age might set a precedent that could be misapplied. The spouse's concern is valid because non-violent solutions like telling the teacher or walking away are preferable. The parent's method might not account for the child's ability to assess the situation correctly, and the other child might react negatively, as the daughter even worried about.\n\nIn terms of child development, it's generally recommended to guide children in using words or seeking help rather than physical responses. So, the parent's advice might be well-intentioned but not age-appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be AITA, meaning the parent is in the wrong for encouraging physical retaliation over non-violent solutions.\n"
