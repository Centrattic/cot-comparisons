Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and not respecting her when she doesn't want it.\n\nFirst, the situation: the other kid is being physically overwhelming, hugging and kissing her forcefully. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent advised the child to push back if the other kid won't stop, and even to push back if the other kid retaliates, or run and tell an adult. The spouse thinks this is wrong, advising to tell teachers instead of using violence.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is that the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which the parent calls \"legit violence,\" and that the child should defend herself. The spouse disagrees, thinking that using any violence is bad, even in self-defense.\n\nI need to consider if teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force in this context is appropriate. On one hand, the child's autonomy and right to say no to unwanted touch is important. Teaching her to set boundaries and protect herself can be seen as empowering. Especially since the teachers aren't stopping the behavior, maybe the child needs to learn to take self-protective measures.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a young child to use physical force could lead to escalations. The parent acknowledges the risk that the other kid might push back, but suggests the child should push back again. For a 4-year-old, this might be confusing or lead to more conflict. Also, there's the concern about normalizing any form of violence, even if it's defensive. The spouse's point is that non-violent solutions (like telling a teacher) should be emphasized.\n\nBut the parent is not encouraging random violence. The context is a situation where the child is being physically forced into interactions she doesn't want, and adults aren't intervening. The parent is trying to give the child tools to protect herself when the system isn't working. That seems reasonable. However, the method of pushing back might not be the best approach for a preschooler. Maybe alternative strategies, like moving away or seeking help immediately, would be better.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's advice was appropriate. The parent is not promoting aggression for fun but rather self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically violated. The child is old enough to understand the concept of respecting boundaries. However, the parent might not have considered that a 4-year-old might not have the impulse control or judgment to assess when to use force and when to seek help. The spouse's concern about using violence at all might be about the message it sends about conflict resolution.\n\nIn many child protection guidelines, teaching children to resist unwanted touch is important, especially when it's non-consensual. However, the method matters. Teaching a child to push back could be seen as a form of self-defense, but in a daycare setting, it's also about preventing cycles of violence. The parent's approach is pragmatic, given that the teachers aren't effective, but the spouse's approach is more about avoiding physical solutions.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The parent's intention was to protect the child from unwanted contact, which is important. The method might be debatable, but the parent isn't encouraging unprovoked violence. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's approach is about empowering the child. Given that, I think the parent is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
