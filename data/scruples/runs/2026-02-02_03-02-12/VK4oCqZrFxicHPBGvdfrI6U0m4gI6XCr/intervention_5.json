Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's partner argues that they should only report to teachers and not use any violence. The author believes it's okay to use \"legit force\" in self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable by another child who doesn't stop even when she yells. The teachers aren't catching it, so the child might feel unsafe. The parent is teaching the child to set boundaries and protect herself. But at 4 years old, is physical resistance appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to defend themselves when someone is being aggressive could be important. However, at such a young age, children might not have the maturity to handle such situations. The parent is advising to push back, which is a form of physical response. Even if it's minimal, like a push, does that set a bad precedent? The parent mentions they are strict about avoiding violence otherwise, so this is a specific case of self-defense.\n\nThe partner is concerned about using violence at all. But the parent argues it's \"legit violence,\" meaning necessary to stop harm. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate. The child is being physically forced into uncomfortable situations, so the parent is helping her understand that she can protect herself. However, the alternative solutions (reporting to teachers) aren't working, which is a problem. The parent might be trying to empower the child to take action when adults aren't effective.\n\nBut considering the child's age, the parent's approach might be too direct. Maybe the child should be taught other methods first, like using her voice more clearly, moving away, or seeking immediate help. Physical resistance might escalate the situation or confuse the child about when it's okay to use force. The line between self-defense and violence can be blurry, especially for a young child. If the parent is teaching that pushing is okay in this specific context, is that a clear enough boundary for the child to understand?\n\nAlso, the fact that the teachers aren't addressing the issue is concerning. The parent might feel they need to step in, but the approach could be more about teaching the child to handle it herself rather than through physical means. There's a balance between empowering the child and not encouraging aggression.\n\nI think the parent's intention is good\u2014to protect their daughter. But the method might not be the best. Maybe suggesting non-violent ways to assert her space, like firm \"no\" and walking away, while reinforcing the importance of telling an adult immediately. The parent's answer includes both pushing and running to tell an adult, which is good, but the pushing part is where the partner is objecting. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to protect their child from harm, which is their responsibility. However, the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the right approach for a 4-year-old. The partner's concern is valid because even minimal violence can be confusing for a child. The parent might not be in the wrong, but the approach could be improved. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the parent is acting in their child's best interest to stop harmful behavior, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
