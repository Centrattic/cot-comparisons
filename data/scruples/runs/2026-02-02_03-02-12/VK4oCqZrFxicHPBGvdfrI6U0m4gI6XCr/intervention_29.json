Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is at daycare, and there's another kid who's hugging her too hard and sometimes kissing her. The daughter has tried telling the kid to stop and even told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the kid away if the other kid is violent, and even said to push back or run away if the other kid retaliates. The spouse is upset because they think the daughter should only tell the teachers and not use violence. \n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The user thinks the parent isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. \n\nI should consider a few things. At 4 years old, children are learning to navigate social interactions and how to handle personal boundaries. The other kid's behavior seems to be aggressive or inappropriate, especially if the daughter is uncomfortable and the daycare staff aren't addressing it. The parent is trying to teach their daughter how to protect herself when verbal communication and adult intervention haven't worked. \n\nHowever, using physical force, even if minimal (like pushing), might not be the best approach for a young child. It could escalate the situation or teach that violence is an acceptable response. Also, daycare environments typically have rules about how children should handle conflicts, often encouraging non-violent solutions. The parent's advice might conflict with these guidelines. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's concern is valid. The daughter is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which could be a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior. Teaching her to assert her boundaries might be necessary. The parent is emphasizing de-escalation (like pushing away, not hitting back) and then running to an adult. The spouse's view is about avoiding any violence, which is a common parenting approach to prevent cycles of aggression.\n\nI need to weigh the child's safety and autonomy against the potential consequences of encouraging physical resistance. The daycare's role is also important\u2014maybe they should be more proactive if the current methods aren't working. \n\nIn some contexts, teaching a child to use \"legit force\" to stop unwanted physical contact for self-defense is seen as appropriate, especially if the child is being abused or harassed. However, in a daycare setting, the expectation might be that the staff manage such situations, and parents are supposed to work with them. The parent's solution might be seen as taking matters into their own hands when the system isn't working.\n\nBut the daughter is only 4, so her ability to handle the situation might be limited. Maybe the better approach is to work more closely with the daycare, perhaps involving the parents of the other child, or seeking more formal intervention if the behavior persists. Encouraging the child to push could lead to more conflict or even get the daughter in trouble.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about not teaching violence, which is a valid point. Even in self-defense, for young children, the priority is usually to teach them to walk away, tell an adult, and avoid physical confrontation. The parent's advice might be an overstepping, especially if the daycare isn't addressing the issue adequately. It's possible the parent should have focused more on working with the daycare rather than advising their daughter to push.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent might be in the wrong. They're teaching their child to respond to violence with violence, which could have negative consequences. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such situations, and the parent's solution might not align with their policies. The spouse's advice to rely on reporting might be more appropriate for a 4-year-old in a structured environment.\n"
