Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The daughter already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent's spouse disagrees, saying non-violence is better.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child experiencing uncomfortable physical interactions from a peer. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense in a situation where the child is clearly upset. The key points here are the child's safety and the context of the advice. The parent isn't encouraging random violence but rather teaching their daughter to protect herself when another child is being aggressive and not respecting her boundaries.\n\nAt 4 years old, children are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent's approach might be seen as proactive in teaching the child to assert her own space. However, there's also a consideration of teaching non-violence and communication. But in this case, the other child isn't responding to verbal cues, so physical action might be necessary for the child's immediate comfort and safety.\n\nThe spouse's argument is about not using violence, but the parent's advice is framed as \"legit force\" in response to violence. The line here is blurry because both sides are children, but the parent is trying to protect their daughter from ongoing distress. It's a balancing act between teaching non-violent resolution and ensuring the child's immediate well-being.\n\nConsidering that the teachers haven't intervened effectively, the parent's approach might be justified as a necessary step. The parent is also emphasizing communication and reporting the incident to adults, which aligns with proper child safety protocols. So, the parent's advice to use force when necessary, while not ideal in all contexts, seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
