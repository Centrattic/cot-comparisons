Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parents are discussing how to handle it.\n\nThe author told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too forceful, especially when the kid doesn't stop even after she asks. The spouse thinks they should just tell the teachers and avoid any violence. The author argues that it's about using \"legit force\" in a situation of unwanted contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, kids are starting to understand personal boundaries, but they might not have the verbal or physical skills to handle such situations. The daycare teachers aren't able to catch it in the act, so the kid isn't getting corrected by adults. The daughter has already tried to tell the teachers, but it's not working. So maybe the author feels the need to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nNow, the author's advice is to push back or run away. But there's a risk that the other child might retaliate, which the daughter herself mentions. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, even in self-defense. But the author is emphasizing that it's a case of self-defense against unwanted physical contact.\n\nIn terms of child psychology, some experts might say that teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could be inappropriate because they might not understand the nuances. They might act out or misinterpret the situation. On the other hand, teaching a child to assert themselves and set boundaries is important. The key is whether the author's advice is proportionate and age-appropriate.\n\nThe daycare environment is supposed to be a safe space, so maybe the solution should involve the daycare staff more. The parents might need to work with the daycare to address the other child's behavior, perhaps involving the parents of the other child. But the author's approach is more about immediate self-defense, which could be necessary if the teachers aren't effective.\n\nAnother angle is legal and ethical. In some cases, teaching a child to defend themselves is seen as necessary, but it's a sensitive issue with young children. There's a balance between letting the child learn to say no verbally and allowing physical resistance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might depend on cultural or personal views. If the author's advice is framed as a last resort after trying to tell an adult, then it's more reasonable. But if the focus is on using violence instead of non-violent solutions, that could be problematic. The author emphasizes that it's about \"legit violence\" and not random aggression, which seems to be a key point in their defense.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the author is not in the wrong because they are trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, especially when the daycare isn't handling it. Teaching self-defense at a basic level for a child in such a specific context might be appropriate. However, there's also a valid concern about promoting violence, so the spouse's perspective has merit. But given the scenario, the author's actions seem to be in the child's best interest.\n"
