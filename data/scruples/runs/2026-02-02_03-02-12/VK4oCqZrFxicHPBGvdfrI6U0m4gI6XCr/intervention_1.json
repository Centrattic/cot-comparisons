Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another child who's being too aggressive with hugs and kisses. They had a fight with their SO over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old's understanding of boundaries and self-defense is limited. The parent's advice is about using \"legit force\" when someone won't stop despite the child's protests. The other kid is coming on too strong, even after being told by teachers. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter from discomfort, which is understandable.\n\nBut, the SO argues against using any violence, emphasizing reporting to adults. At that age, teaching non-violent conflict resolution is important. However, the parent might be concerned that the teachers aren't addressing the issue effectively. The child's reaction, worrying about retaliation, is a valid concern. Maybe the parent didn't consider how a 4-year-old might interpret pushing as a form of violence, even if it's self-defense.\n\nAlso, the line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence can be blurry. Young children might not have the impulse control to use force appropriately. It's possible that the parent's approach could lead to aggression, even if their intent was to empower the child. The SO's point about relying on teachers and avoiding all violence might be more age-appropriate, focusing on communication and seeking help.\n\nBut the parent did mention that the child had already reported the issue, and the teachers aren't effective. So maybe the parent felt they needed to give her another option when the first one isn't working. The key is whether the advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. While the parent's intention is good, the method could be problematic. It's better to teach a child to clearly say \"no\" and immediately seek help from an adult, rather than engaging in physical confrontation, which might escalate the situation or cause confusion about appropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong, but I need to check if there's a middle ground. The parent is trying to protect their child, but the method could be too direct for a young child. Maybe the SO is right in that teaching to avoid all violence and focus on reporting is safer. The parent's advice, while well-meaning, could be seen as promoting aggression. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
