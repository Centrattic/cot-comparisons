Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard or kissing her. The parent argues that it's \"legit violence\" because the other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's protests, and they told her to push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being forced into uncomfortable physical contact by another child, and the teachers aren't effectively addressing it. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense and assertiveness. But at 4 years old, is pushing back appropriate? \n\nOn one hand, it's important to teach children to recognize and reject unwanted physical contact, which is a crucial boundary. Teaching a child to stand up for themselves can be protective. However, at such a young age, the child might not have the emotional maturity to handle a physical confrontation appropriately. There's also the risk that the other child might react badly, leading to more conflict or injury.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might escalate the situation. It could also be seen as encouraging aggression. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such interactions, so maybe relying on the teachers is the better approach here. But if the teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, the parent might feel their child isn't safe.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence. The parent's advice is specific to a scenario where the other child is being overly forceful and not respecting the daughter's signals. However, pushing back might not be the best strategy for a 4-year-old. Alternative solutions like encouraging the daughter to clearly express her discomfort in front of the teachers, or working more closely with the daycare to address the other child's behavior, might be better.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, parents have a duty to protect their children. However, teaching violence as a first response isn't typically advised for such age groups. The parent's intention is to protect their child, but the method might not be the most effective or safe. The answer hinges on whether the parent's advice crosses into promoting violence versus teaching appropriate self-defense. Given the age and the context, the parent might be seen as overstepping by suggesting physical action instead of relying on the daycare's intervention. So, the answer could lean towards the parent being at fault, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
