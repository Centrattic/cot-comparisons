Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is dealing with a 4-year-old who's being hugged too roughly by another kid. The daughter has tried telling the kid to stop and even told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent advised the daughter to push the other kid away if he won't stop, and even suggested pushing back or running away if the other kid fights back.\n\nHmm, so the parent is teaching their child to use force to protect themselves. The spouse argues that it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence. The key here is whether instructing a young child to use physical force is appropriate. At 4 years old, kids might not fully understand boundaries or the consequences of their actions. The parent's approach emphasizes self-defense, which can be justified if the child is in a situation where they're being harmed. However, there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation or use force inappropriately elsewhere. \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use violence at such a young age could set a bad precedent. Daycare staff are responsible for managing these interactions, and involving adults is a standard approach. But in this case, the teachers aren't effective, so the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself.\n\nI think it's a balance. The parent's intention is to teach self-defense, which is a form of empowerment. However, the method might be too aggressive for a 4-year-old to handle responsibly. Maybe a better approach would be to reinforce the child's ability to say \"no,\" seek help immediately, and maybe teach non-violent ways to extricate themselves. But given the scenario, the parent's advice isn't entirely wrong if the child is being subjected to unwanted and forceful physical contact. The parent is trying to address a real problem that teachers aren't handling. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they taught the child to respond.\n"
