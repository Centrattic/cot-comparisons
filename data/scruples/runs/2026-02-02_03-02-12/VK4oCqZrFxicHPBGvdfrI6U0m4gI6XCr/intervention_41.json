Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent and their spouse disagree on this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged and kissed in a way that's uncomfortable and even painful. The child has tried telling the other kid but it's not stopping. The teachers aren't seeing it, so they can't intervene effectively. The parent is teaching the daughter to use force to stop the unwanted contact, emphasizing that it's okay to push back if someone is hurting her and not listening. The spouse is against using any violence, suggesting only telling an adult.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adult intervention isn't working. Teaching a child to defend themselves in situations where they're being harmed makes sense. The parent is not advocating for general violence but specific, necessary force to stop a threat. The daughter is old enough to understand the difference, according to the parent.\n\nHowever, there's a concern about teaching children to use violence. At 4 years old, their impulse control and judgment might not be fully developed. Even if the parent is clear about the intent, the child might misinterpret or escalate the situation. Also, pushing back could lead to physical altercations that might be harder to control in a daycare setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the current approach (telling teachers) hasn't worked. The parent is trying an alternative method when the system isn't supporting the child. The spouse's approach is more about non-violence, which is a valid viewpoint, but it's not effective in this case since the teachers aren't seeing the incidents.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of self-defense for children. Some experts argue that children should be taught to set boundaries and use their voice first, but if that's not working, physical protection might be necessary. The key is whether the parent's instruction is proportionate and clear. Pushing away is a minimal force response, not aggressive. The parent also advises running and telling an adult if the other child retaliates. That seems balanced.\n\nBut there's a risk that the child might feel justified in using any form of violence, which could lead to other issues. However, the parent emphasizes that it's only in cases of \"legit violence,\" so maybe that's a line they can keep clear.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some cultures emphasize non-violence, while others stress self-defense. The parent might be right in preparing the child to protect herself, especially if the daycare isn't addressing the issue adequately.\n\nSo weighing all this, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to protect their child in a situation that's not being handled properly by the daycare. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's approach is a reasonable alternative when other methods fail. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
