Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's forcefully hugging and kissing her. The situation is at daycare, and the teachers haven't been effective in stopping the behavior. The other kid doesn't stop even when told.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that it's okay to use force to stop someone who's being violent, especially when the child has already tried to tell the teachers and the other kid isn't listening. The parent emphasizes that the daughter is being taught to use \"legit force,\" not violence. The spouse disagrees, thinking that non-violent solutions like telling a teacher are better, and that using any force is wrong.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is young, and their ability to understand and manage conflict is developing. The parent is teaching self-defense, but at such a young age, physical confrontation might escalate the situation. Also, in daycare settings, the staff's role is to intervene in such cases. The parent might be overstepping by encouraging direct physical resistance, which could lead to more harm if the other child is aggressive or if the daycare has policies against that.\n\nHowever, the parent's concern is valid. The daughter is being physically uncomfortable, and the current measures (telling teachers) aren't working. Teaching a child to assertively push away to stop unwanted contact could be a form of self-protection. But there's a line between self-defense and encouraging violence. The key here is the parent's message: they're not promoting violence but teaching the child to respond to immediate threat with necessary force. However, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate, leading to misuse.\n\nAlso, daycare environments typically have specific protocols for handling such issues. Parents are usually advised to communicate with the daycare first. The fact that the teachers aren't seeing the behavior is a problem, but the solution might be more about the daycare's approach rather than the child's actions.\n\nThe spouse's point is that non-violent solutions are better. At that age, children are learning to express their feelings and seek help. Encouraging physical responses might conflict with teaching conflict resolution through communication. The parent might be right in wanting to protect their child, but the method could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of child development, it's important to teach children how to say no, to seek help, and to understand personal boundaries. Physical responses might not be the best approach, especially with peers. The parent's approach could lead to the child being labeled as aggressive or could escalate conflicts.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's intention is good, but the method might not be the best for a 4-year-old. Teaching a child to use physical force to avoid uncomfortable situations could have unintended consequences. The correct approach would involve working with the daycare to address the behavior of the other child and ensuring the daughter knows how to communicate her discomfort effectively. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong by encouraging physical resistance instead of focusing on non-violent methods and collaboration with the daycare.\n"
