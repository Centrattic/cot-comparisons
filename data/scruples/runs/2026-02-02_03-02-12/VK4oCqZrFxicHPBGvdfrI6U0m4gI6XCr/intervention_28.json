Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is wondering if they were wrong to tell their 4-year-old daughter she can push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her when she doesn't want it. The kid in question is 4 years old too, and the parent has observed the behavior. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent argues that teaching the child to use \"legit force\" when someone won't stop hurting her is necessary, while the spouse thinks she should only tell adults.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four is very young. At that age, kids might not know how to handle conflict or express their discomfort effectively. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but is physical pushing appropriate? Pushing back could escalate the situation, especially if the other child retaliates. The daughter even expresses concern that the other kid might push her back. The parent says to push again or run and tell an adult. But teaching a 4-year-old to push might model aggressive behavior, even if it's in self-defense. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and personal space. The other child is forcefully hugging and kissing, which is a form of unwanted physical contact. The parent is right to address this, as it's important for the daughter to understand her boundaries. However, the method of handling it\u2014physical pushing\u2014might not be the best approach. Preschoolers aren't always able to assess when force is necessary or how to use it without causing harm. There's also the risk that the daughter might overuse the advice, pushing others in non-emergency situations.\n\nThe spouse's viewpoint emphasizes non-violence and relying on adults. That's a valid approach because teaching kids to seek help from authority figures is important. However, the parent's concern is that the teachers aren't intervening effectively. So there's a dilemma between teaching self-defense versus encouraging non-violence. \n\nAnother angle: the child might not yet have the emotional maturity to discern when \"legit force\" is appropriate. If the daughter pushes, it could lead to more conflict or even be perceived as the aggressor. The parent is trying to protect their child, but the method might not be age-appropriate. The school's role here is also crucial. The fact that the teachers aren't catching it when it happens makes it hard for them to act, so the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself.\n\nIn terms of child development, at 4 years old, children are learning to communicate their feelings and assert themselves. Encouraging verbal responses or seeking help might be more effective. Physical solutions might be too advanced for her to handle appropriately. Also, the parent's advice could inadvertently teach that physical force is acceptable in certain situations, which might not align with their overall values, as they mention they are strict about not using violence otherwise.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's intentions are protective, but the method might not be suitable for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about non-violence and reporting to adults is valid. The parent might be right in the sense that the daughter needs to protect herself, but the approach could be problematic. Therefore, the parent might be partly in the wrong for not considering the child's age and the appropriateness of the action.\n"
