Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The other parent (the SO) thinks it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid any violence, while the author thinks that using force in self-defense is okay here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The kid is a 4-year-old who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another child. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The author is teaching their daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running and telling an adult if there's retaliation.\n\nNow, thinking about child safety and teaching boundaries. At 4, children are learning about personal space and how to handle uncomfortable situations. The other child's behavior might be inappropriate, especially if it's forceful and not wanted. The author is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself when the usual channels (teachers) aren't effective. But using force could escalate things, which is a valid concern. However, the parent argues it's \"legit violence\" in self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO is concerned about teaching non-violence. But the daughter is being subjected to unwanted physical contact. The key here is whether the author's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. Maybe the parent is right in teaching the child to stand up for herself when other methods have failed. However, the risk of the child escalating the situation or facing retaliation is there. But given that the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries, teaching her to assert herself might be necessary.\n\nI need to check if there's a standard approach in such cases. Usually, it's advised to teach children to say \"no\" and tell an adult, but sometimes that's not enough. The parent might be justified in teaching the child to physically remove herself in a way that's age-appropriate. Pushing might be a form of self-defense here, not initiating violence. The parent emphasizes that it's only in cases of unwanted force, so the line is clear.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author is not in the wrong. They're teaching their child to protect herself in a situation where the child is being physically uncomfortable. The answer is B.\n"
