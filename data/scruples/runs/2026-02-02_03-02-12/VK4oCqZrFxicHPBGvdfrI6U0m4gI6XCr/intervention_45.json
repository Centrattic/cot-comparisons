Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who told their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The husband disagrees, saying she should only tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other kid is hugging her in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even after she tells him to stop. The daughter already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent is advising her to use force to protect herself, which is a form of self-defense. However, the child is only 4 years old, so the appropriateness of teaching her to use physical force is a point to consider.\n\nThe main arguments would be: on one hand, teaching a child to defend herself in situations where she's being physically overwhelmed could be seen as necessary for her safety. On the other hand, encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, might set a bad precedent and could escalate the situation. There's also the aspect of the child's age\u20144 years old might not have the maturity to handle such situations without adult supervision.\n\nThe husband's concern is about using non-violent solutions, like telling a teacher. The parent argues that the daughter is old enough to understand the difference between legitimate force and violence. But at 4, children are still learning social boundaries and conflict resolution. Maybe the parent's approach is too direct for her age.\n\nAdditionally, the other child's parents might be overbearing, which complicates things. But the immediate issue is the daughter's safety and comfort. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the parent is trying to empower her child.\n\nI need to balance between protecting the child's autonomy and teaching non-violence. In some contexts, self-defense is taught to children, but it's usually in structured environments. However, this is an unsupervised situation in daycare. The key is whether pushing is a reasonable response for a 4-year-old in that context.\n\nAlso, the fact that the daughter was already reporting to teachers but it wasn't working suggests the parent is trying to find a solution. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the child to immediately tell an adult if the situation occurs again, rather than using physical force. But the parent's intention was to protect the child from harm, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method could be problematic given the child's age. There's a risk of teaching that physical retaliation is acceptable in conflicts, which might not be ideal. The husband's suggestion to rely on adults might be more appropriate, even if it's not always effective. However, the parent's advice is about self-defense in a specific, violent situation. The question is whether \"pushing away\" is considered a legitimate form of self-defense for a 4-year-old.\n\nIn some child-rearing philosophies, allowing a child to set physical boundaries is encouraged, but the line between self-defense and initiating violence is thin. Since the other child is the one initiating the unwanted contact, the daughter's response to push back could be seen as defending herself. However, the parent might be overstepping by instructing a child so young to use force, as it could lead to more harm than good, especially if the other child reacts violently.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural or societal norms. In some views, teaching a child to protect herself is right. In others, it's better to avoid any form of physical confrontation. The parent is not in the wrong if their intent is to protect their child, but they might not be considering the developmental appropriateness of the advice given her age.\n"
