Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The daughter already told the teachers, but they didn't act effectively. The author's spouse is upset and thinks she should just tell the teachers again instead of using force.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child involved. The daughter is 4, so she's very young. At that age, children might not fully understand boundaries or how to handle situations where someone is being too aggressive. The other child is also 4, so maybe it's just part of typical behavior for that age, but the parent says it's violent hugging and kissing, which the child finds uncomfortable.\n\nThe author argues that the other child is using \"legit violence\" and that their daughter has a right to push back. But is it appropriate for a 4-year-old to be taught to use force? At that age, kids are still learning social skills and how to express their feelings. The parent might be trying to teach self-defense, but maybe the approach is too aggressive for a young child. The spouse is concerned about encouraging violence even in self-defense scenarios.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers haven't been effective. The parent might be frustrated and taking matters into their own hands because the system isn't working. However, teaching a child to use physical force at a young age could lead to more aggression in the future. There's a balance between teaching a child to set boundaries and using physical force.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical perspective. If a child is being harmed, even accidentally, parents have a responsibility to protect them. But the situation here is more about discomfort and unwanted physical contact. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself, but the method might be too harsh for the situation.\n\nI should also consider developmental psychology. At 4 years old, children might not have the emotional maturity to handle such a response. Pushing back could escalate the situation, leading to more conflict. The parent's advice to push back might be well-intentioned but could be inappropriate for the child's age and the context.\n\nThe spouse's viewpoint is valid too. Encouraging non-violence and seeking help from adults is a standard approach in parenting to prevent cycles of aggression. The parent might be overestimating the effectiveness of physical resistance in this scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method of encouraging physical pushback might not be the best approach given the child's age and the social dynamics of daycare. The spouse's concern is about promoting non-violence and proper conflict resolution. So, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate.\n"
