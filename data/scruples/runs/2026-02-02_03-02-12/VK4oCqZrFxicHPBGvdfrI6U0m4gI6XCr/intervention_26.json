Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The situation involves the other child not respecting the daughter's boundaries, even after being told by adults. The author's spouse is upset, arguing that the daughter should just tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child, 4 years old. At that age, a child's understanding of how to handle social situations is still developing. The author is trying to teach their daughter how to protect herself when the other child's actions are making her uncomfortable. The other kid is being aggressive, and the teachers aren't effectively stopping it. The author's advice is to use physical force to push away, but only in self-defense and to then seek help. The spouse, on the other hand, believes that the daughter should not use any violence and instead rely on adults to resolve the issue.\n\nI should think about the principles of child safety and appropriate behavior. Teaching a child to recognize when someone is violating their personal space and how to respond is important. However, the method of response is a key factor. The author is encouraging the use of force only when necessary, which could be seen as self-defense. But with a 4-year-old, the ability to assess and respond appropriately might be limited. There's a risk that the child could escalate the situation or misinterpret the advice. \n\nAlso, the daycare's role is mentioned. The teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, which raises concerns about their responsibility. The author is compensating for the daycare's shortcomings by teaching their daughter to protect herself. However, the spouse's point is that teaching non-violence is essential, even if it means the child might feel they have to endure the situation until they can get help. \n\nAnother angle is the potential long-term impact on the daughter. If she learns to use physical force, she might carry that mindset into other situations. But if she's taught to rely only on adults, she might not feel empowered to protect herself in the moment. \n\nThe situation involves a child who's being forced into uncomfortable physical contact, which could be a form of harassment. The author is trying to equip their child with tools to handle an immediate threat when the system (daycare) isn't working. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, but the author argues it's in self-defense. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a balance between allowing children to learn conflict resolution and ensuring their safety. The author's approach is proactive in teaching the child to stand up for herself, while the spouse's approach is more passive, relying on external authorities. \n\nI think the author is in the right because the child is being subjected to unwanted force, and the author is teaching her to protect herself when the other methods (telling adults) aren't working. However, the spouse's concern about encouraging violence is valid, but the context is self-defense. The key is that the author isn't promoting random violence but specific actions in response to a threat. The daycare's failure to address the issue also plays a role here. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
