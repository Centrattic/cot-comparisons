Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being overly aggressive with hugs and kisses. The parent and spouse had a disagreement about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being physically overbearing, not respecting the daughter's boundaries. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is encouraging the child to use force to protect herself if verbal methods fail. The spouse thinks it's better to rely on adults and not use any violence.\n\nAt 4 years old, children are starting to understand boundaries and personal space. The parent is teaching the daughter to assert herself, which is important for self-defense and setting limits. However, the spouse is concerned about promoting violence. The parent clarifies they aren't advocating for general violence, just defending against physical force. \n\nI should think about child development. At this age, kids might not always listen to authority figures in the moment, so empowering the child to act on her own can be necessary. But there's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. The parent's advice seems targeted and specific to a situation where the other child is being violent, which is different from fighting for fun or without reason.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the child is old enough to understand the difference between legitimate force and violence. It's important to assess if a 4-year-old can truly discern when it's appropriate to push back. However, given that the other child isn't responding to verbal cues and the teachers aren't catching it in time, the parent's approach might be a practical solution.\n\nIn terms of child-rearing philosophies, some parents emphasize non-violence and reporting to adults, while others teach children to protect themselves. Both have merits. Here, the parent is not promoting aggression but rather self-protection in a specific context. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's advice seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong. They're addressing a real issue with a practical solution, focusing on the child's safety and autonomy. The key is that the parent is teaching the child to defend herself in a specific, necessary situation, not to use violence generally. So the answer should be B.\n"
