Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being overly affectionate in a way the daughter finds uncomfortable. The parent's spouse thinks it's better to just tell the teachers, but the parent argues about using \"legit force.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: a kid is hugging/kissing the daughter in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even after she's tried to stop it. The teachers aren't effective. The parent is advising the daughter to push back if she can't stop it otherwise. \n\nSo, the key points here are about teaching a child to protect themselves versus avoiding violence. At four years old, kids are learning boundaries. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to stand up for herself in a situation where she's being forced into unwanted physical contact. But there's a concern that teaching a child to push back might escalate things, especially since the other kid might react violently. The spouse thinks reporting to teachers is the only solution.\n\nBut the parent is making a distinction between violent retaliation and using force to stop unwanted contact. They mention that the daughter is old enough to understand the difference. The scenario is similar to teaching self-defense in a non-lethal way. \n\nIn some parenting approaches, it's important to teach children to set boundaries. However, there's also a risk that physical responses could lead to more conflict. The parent is trying to balance safety and empowerment. \n\nLegally and ethically, the parent might be in a gray area. Encouraging a child to defend themselves can be seen as teaching self-defense, but there's also a responsibility to ensure that the child doesn't learn that violence is an acceptable solution. However, given that the parent is specifying situations where the other child is being violent and not encouraging general violence, it's a nuanced case.\n\nIn child development terms, teaching a young child to recognize and act on their discomfort is positive. But the spouse's concern is valid too\u2014physical responses might not be the best solution. However, in this specific case, the parent is providing a tool for immediate self-protection when other methods (telling teachers) haven't worked. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's approach might be justified as teaching self-advocacy. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but it's close. The key factors are the context of the other child's aggressive behavior and the parent's specific instructions not to use excessive force.\n"
