Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable, even after she tells the teacher and the other child continues. The parent's spouse thinks the parent is wrong because they should rely on teachers and not use violence. The parent argues that it's about self-defense when there's forced interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, children are still learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent is trying to teach her daughter to set physical boundaries, which is important. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone back might escalate the situation. The other child might react aggressively, leading to a bigger conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is right that their daughter has the right to feel safe and to protect herself. The teacher isn't always present, and the daughter already tried telling them without success. The parent's advice is about self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her no. But is teaching a child to push back appropriate? At that age, children might not fully understand the concept of proportionality in their actions. Pushing could lead to more harm than good if the other child retaliates.\n\nThe spouse's concern about non-violence is valid. It's a common parenting approach to teach children to use words and seek help. However, the parent's approach emphasizes self-advocacy. The key here is balancing the need to protect the child while teaching appropriate conflict resolution. \n\nIn some contexts, teaching a child to use physical force might be seen as acceptable for immediate safety, but there's a risk of normalizing physical responses. The parent might be right in this specific case where the child is being physically forced, but the method could be problematic. Maybe alternative strategies, like teaching the child to say \"no\" clearly, use a firm voice, or move away, would be better. \n\nAlso, the daughter's age is a factor. At 4, their motor skills and impulse control are still developing. Pushing might not be the best solution. The parent might have been trying to empower the child, but the spouse's approach of relying on adults might be more suitable. \n\nI think the parent is trying to do the right thing by addressing their daughter's safety, but the method could be better. The answer might be a middle ground, but according to the question's options, it's either A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering all angles, the parent's intention is good, but advising a 4-year-old to push back might not be the best approach. So, maybe A is the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Another perspective is that teaching self-defense at a young age is important, so B could be the choice. It's a bit of a toss-up. The parent's advice might be seen as wrong because it could encourage violence, even if it's for self-defense. However, in the context of protecting the child from unwanted physical contact, it's understandable. Hmm. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the focus is on the immediate protection of the child and the parent's justification that it's \"legit violence,\" then perhaps B is correct. But if the emphasis is on avoiding any form of physical retaliation, then A. I'm leaning towards A because the parent is teaching the child to use physical force, which might not be the best lesson for a 4-year-old, but the situation is about protecting against unwanted physical contact. Maybe the answer is B. I'm conflicted. I'll go with B because the parent is trying to teach self-defense in a specific context where the child is being physically forced, and the alternative methods aren't working. The spouse's approach is valid, but the parent's advice isn't entirely wrong either.\n"
