Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense since the other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's protests and even when told by adults. The spouse disagrees, insisting that violence should never be an option and that reporting to teachers is the only solution.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding of violence. At 4 years old, a child's concept of force versus violence might not be fully developed. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself in a situation where the other child's behavior is unwanted and persistent, even after being told to stop. However, the spouse is concerned about encouraging any form of violence, no matter the context.\n\nNext, the setting is a daycare, which has its own policies on handling such situations. The daycare teachers aren't able to catch the incidents because they're brief and might not be around when they happen. The parent feels that the daughter's safety and comfort are at stake, so they're teaching her to defend herself. But daycare environments usually have established procedures to manage conflicts, and parents are typically advised to address these through the daycare rather than directly instructing children to use force.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they are otherwise strict about not using violence towards other kids. They emphasize that the daughter should only push back if it's to stop unwanted force. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone in response to a hug, even if it's too forceful, might be misinterpreted or overused. The child might not recognize the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force, leading to potential escalation.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and encouraging violence. The parent's approach is about allowing the child to set boundaries, which is positive. But using physical force, even if minimal, could lead to more conflict or unintended consequences. The spouse's concern is valid because in a daycare, the responsibility lies with the staff to manage such interactions safely.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the method of teaching to push back might not be the best approach in a daycare setting where adults should handle such situations. The correct course of action would be to involve the daycare more actively, seek their intervention, and teach the daughter to communicate her discomfort without resorting to physical force. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong for encouraging violence, even in self-defense, in this context.\n"
