Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard. The situation involves a child who's being hugged forcefully and even kissed without consent, and the parents are divided on how to handle it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, she's still very young, and her understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is developing. The parent is teaching her to use physical force to stop the other child, which could be seen as teaching self-defense. On the other hand, the spouse thinks she should only tell the teacher and avoid violence entirely.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The 4-year-old is experiencing uncomfortable physical contact, which can be a form of bullying or harassment even at that age. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself when other methods (telling the teacher) haven't worked. However, using force, even if it's just pushing, might escalate the situation. The child also expresses fear that the other kid might push back, which is a valid concern.\n\nLegally and in terms of child safety, it's important to teach children to set boundaries. But the method of teaching them to respond with force needs to be appropriate. At 4 years old, the child might not fully understand how to use force without overdoing it or getting hurt. The parent's approach might be seen as promoting violence, which could lead to more conflicts. However, the parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" in a specific context where the other child is being violent.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about using any form of violence, which is a common parenting stance to encourage non-violent conflict resolution. But in cases of ongoing unwanted physical contact that's causing distress, teaching a child to assertively push away could be necessary for their well-being. The parent is not encouraging general violence but a specific response to being harmed.\n\nI need to weigh the principles here. Encouraging self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically forced is about protecting her from harm. However, the effectiveness and appropriateness of this method for a child her age are debatable. Some experts might say that even young children can learn to set physical boundaries, while others might argue that it's better to rely on adults to intervene.\n\nAlso, the fact that the teachers haven't been effective so far is a problem. Maybe the parent should also consider escalating the issue to daycare management or seeking further intervention rather than relying solely on the child to handle it. But the immediate concern is the child's safety and comfort.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, which is a parent's duty. However, the method might be questionable. The spouse's concern about promoting violence is valid, but in this context, the parent is addressing a specific form of unwanted contact. The answer might depend on cultural or personal parenting beliefs. However, generally, teaching a child to use force to protect themselves isn't necessarily wrong if it's in response to harmful actions and if done in a controlled way. So the parent's approach might not be in the wrong, but there are nuances.\n"
