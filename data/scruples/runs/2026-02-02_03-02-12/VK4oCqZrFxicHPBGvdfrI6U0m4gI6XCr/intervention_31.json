Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their four-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop even when she yells. The parent's partner disagrees, saying it's better to tell teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At four, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The situation here involves a child who's being forced into uncomfortable physical contact, which is a form of aggression. The parent is teaching their daughter to use physical force to stop it, which is different from general violence. It's about defending herself in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her boundaries.\n\nThe parent argues it's \"legit violence,\" meaning justified self-defense. The partner is concerned about teaching violence, but the parent clarifies they didn't encourage random aggression. The key here is whether the response is proportionate. Pushing away is a minimal form of force compared to hitting or injuring. The parent also advised the child to run and tell an adult if needed, which adds a layer of safety.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of teaching a child to resolve conflicts through non-violent means first. The child has already told the teachers, but they aren't effective. The parent is empowering the child to protect herself when adults aren't available. However, some might argue that even pushing could escalate the situation or teach the wrong lesson about using physical force.\n\nAnother angle is the child's understanding. At four, a child might not grasp the nuances of self-defense versus aggression. The parent's approach might be appropriate given the child's age and the immediate threat. The parent is not promoting violence for fun but a specific response to unwanted force. It's about setting boundaries and self-protection.\n\nIn summary, the parent's advice seems to be about self-defense in a specific context, which is different from general violence. The partner's concern is valid but the parent's approach addresses an immediate safety issue. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
