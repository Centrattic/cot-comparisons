Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her violently is in the wrong. The parent told the child it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop even after she yells. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable by another kid, and the parents have already tried telling the teachers, but that's not working. The parent's advice is about self-defense in a specific context where the other child is persistently aggressive. The key here is whether teaching a 4-year-old to push back is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to stand up for themselves and protect their personal space is important. If the other child is being violent and the teachers aren't effective, the parent might feel they need to empower their child. The parent emphasizes that it's \"legit violence\" when the other child forces kisses or hugs, so using force to stop it could be seen as defensive.\n\nOn the other hand, a 4-year-old might not fully understand the boundaries between defensive and aggressive actions. There's a risk that the child might overreact or use physical force inappropriately. The spouse's concern is valid because encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, might set a precedent. The daycare's teachers are supposed to handle such situations, so maybe the parent should have worked more with them instead of directly teaching the child to act on her own.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the child is old and clever enough to understand the difference. However, at 4, children can still struggle with impulse control and may not always make the right decision in the moment. If the other child retaliates, the child might end up in a worse situation. The spouse's advice to report it to an adult is also a valid approach, especially in a supervised environment like daycare.\n\nBut the parent's main point is about preventing harm when the child can't stop the other through words. If the child is in a situation where she's being physically forced and the adults aren't helping, teaching her to protect herself could be necessary. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate and clearly framed as a last resort when other methods fail.\n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons, the parent's intention is to protect their child from ongoing harm, and they did emphasize using force only when necessary and then reporting. The spouse's concern is about encouraging violence, but the parent is teaching a specific, controlled response. I think the parent is not in the wrong because they're addressing a real problem and trying to empower their child in a way that's proportionate to the threat.\n"
