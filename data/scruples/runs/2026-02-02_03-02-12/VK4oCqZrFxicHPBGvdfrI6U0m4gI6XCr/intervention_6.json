Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too roughly and kissing her when she doesn't want to. The parent argues that it's legitimate force to stop unwanted physical contact, while the spouse thinks it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence entirely.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being subjected to forceful hugs and kisses by another child, which the daughter has already reported to teachers without success. The parent is teaching the child self-defense techniques appropriate for her age\u2014pushing away and, if necessary, pushing back or running to an adult. The key here is that the parent isn't advocating for harmful violence but rather immediate self-protection in a situation where the child feels threatened.\n\nChildren, especially at 4 years old, need to learn how to recognize and respond to uncomfortable situations. While teaching non-violence is important, it's also crucial to empower them to protect themselves when others are not respecting their boundaries. The parent's approach seems to balance both: encouraging the child to stand up for herself in a way that's safe and age-appropriate, while still emphasizing the importance of reporting to adults.\n\nThe spouse's concern about using violence is valid, but in this context, the \"violence\" is minimal\u2014just pushing, which is a natural, instinctive reaction for a child to stop someone from invading her personal space. It's not about escalating conflict but preventing it by stopping the unwanted behavior immediately. The parent also reinforces the idea of seeking help from adults, which is a key part of the strategy.\n\nComparing to real-world advice, many child safety programs teach children to say \"no,\" then to move away or tell an adult. In cases where the child is too young to assert themselves verbally effectively, physical removal might be necessary. The parent is providing practical tools for her daughter to use until she can communicate more effectively or until adults can intervene properly.\n\nAdditionally, the parent is aware of the child's maturity level and is teaching her to distinguish between legitimate self-defense and unnecessary aggression. The daughter's concern about being pushed back by the other child shows that the parent's advice is helping her think critically about her safety.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent's actions seem justified. They're equipping their child with necessary skills to protect herself in a scenario where other methods have failed. The spouse's approach of relying solely on adults might not be sufficient since the teachers haven't addressed the issue effectively. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
