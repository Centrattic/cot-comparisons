Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed too hard by another kid, even after she yells at him. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away and use force if needed. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong because violence isn't the answer, but the parent argues it's about self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent's advice is to use force when necessary, which could be seen as teaching self-defense. But maybe there's a better way to handle it, like reinforcing the idea of saying \"no\" and immediately telling an adult. The parent also mentioned that the daughter already told the teachers, but it's not working. So maybe the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself since the adults aren't effective.\n\nHowever, encouraging a 4-year-old to push another kid might model behavior that could lead to escalation. The child might not know how to use the right amount of force, leading to a fight. Also, in a daycare setting, the staff might have protocols to handle such situations, and involving them is usually the recommended approach. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching children to respond with violence can set a bad precedent for conflict resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's safety and comfort are important. If the other child is being aggressive despite the daughter's attempts to say no, the parent's advice might help her feel more in control. But maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the daughter to remove herself from the situation and seek help immediately, rather than using physical force.\n\nI should also consider the daycare's role here. Maybe the parent should work more closely with the daycare to ensure they monitor the interactions better. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method might not be age-appropriate. At 4 years old, the child might not have the emotional maturity to judge when to use force and when to back off, leading to potential harm or conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's goal is to protect their child, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could be problematic. The spouse's point about avoiding violence and relying on adults might be more developmentally appropriate. So, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical confrontation instead of other methods.\n"
