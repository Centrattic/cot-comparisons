Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's giving her violent hugs and kisses. The parent says the child already told the teachers, but the teachers don't see it happening, and the other kid won't stop. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is using force and not stopping when she yells, it's okay to push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to only tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning how to handle social situations. The parent is trying to teach her to defend herself when someone is being too forceful. But the spouse is concerned about the child using violence even if it's defensive. So the core issue is whether teaching a 4-year-old to push someone away is appropriate, especially given the context of forced hugs/kisses that she doesn't want.\n\nThe parent's approach is about using \"legit violence\" in self-defense. But maybe using the term \"violence\" isn't the best for a 4-year-old. The parent did mention that the child can laugh it off sometimes, but when it's not wanted, they need to act. The other kid doesn't stop even after being told by adults, so the parent is providing an alternative. The spouse is worried about the child learning that violence is okay. But the parent is differentiating between necessary force and unprovoked aggression.\n\nI think the key here is the parent's intention. They're not encouraging general violence but teaching their child to protect herself in a specific scenario where the other child is not respecting her boundaries. The parent is also instructing her to seek help afterward if needed. However, the method of communication might be an issue. Using the term \"legit violence\" might be too complex for a 4-year-old. Maybe the parent should use age-appropriate language like \"tell them to stop\" instead of \"push back.\" But the main point is whether it's right or wrong.\n\nChild development experts often recommend teaching kids to set boundaries and use assertive communication. If the child is being forced into unwanted physical contact and the authorities aren't addressing it, the parent might be trying to empower the child. However, teaching a child to push another might be seen as encouraging physical aggression, even if it's in response. The spouse's concern is valid because even defensive actions can escalate situations, especially in daycare where staff should manage interactions.\n\nBut the parent is trying to protect the child from being hurt and not wanting her to suffer in silence. The daycare might not be monitoring the interactions well, so the parent is taking proactive steps. The question is whether that's appropriate. In some contexts, self-defense is acceptable, but with 4-year-olds, the expectation is that adults manage such situations. The parent might be overstepping by teaching the child to handle it physically when the daycare isn't doing their job effectively. Maybe the parent should focus on other strategies first, like more direct communication with the teachers or involving the daycare in setting boundaries. So, while the parent's intention is good, the method might not be the best approach. Therefore, the answer could be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they might be promoting physical confrontation instead of trusting the daycare or teaching more non-violent solutions.\n"
