Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's giving her forceful hugs and kisses, even after being told to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The other kid is being overly affectionate in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable. The daughter has tried telling the teachers, but it's not stopping. The author advises her daughter to push back if the kid won't stop, which is a form of self-defense. The spouse thinks it's better to tell the teachers instead of using any violence.\n\nSo, the main points here are about teaching a child self-defense vs. non-violence. At 4 years old, kids are still learning boundaries and how to handle social situations. The author's approach is about immediate self-protection, while the spouse's is about reporting and trusting adults to handle it.\n\nI need to consider child development guidelines. Experts often say that for young children, it's important to teach them to say no, to walk away, and to tell a trusted adult. Using physical force might escalate the situation, especially with another child who might not understand the reason. However, if the other kid is being aggressive and not responding to verbal cues, the daughter needs a way to protect herself.\n\nBut wait, pushing is still a form of physical aggression. Even if it's defensive, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone else might not be the best approach. It could lead to more conflict, and the other child might respond in kind, as the daughter mentioned. Also, at that age, children might not have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate. The author's solution includes telling an adult after, which is good, but the initial action of pushing might not be the best method.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare's role is to manage these interactions. The teachers didn't act effectively before, but maybe a more consistent approach from the daycare is needed. The author's spouse is right in that non-violent solutions are preferable. The author's approach might be seen as encouraging violence, even if it's defensive, which contradicts their usual teachings.\n\nBut the author argues it's about \"legit force\" in a situation where the child is being harmed. However, for a 4-year-old, the line between defensive and offensive actions might be blurred. The child could misinterpret the message or use it as an excuse to be aggressive. Plus, the daycare might not want parents teaching children to use force among peers.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, it's a gray area. Parents have a duty to protect their children, but also to teach non-violence. The key is whether the author's advice is proportionate. Pushing in response to a hug might be excessive. Running away and telling an adult is better. The author's advice includes both pushing and telling, but the pushing part is where the controversy lies.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because teaching a young child to use physical force, even in self-defense, can set a precedent for aggressive behavior. Instead, focusing on verbal communication and walking away, along with escalating to adults, would be more effective and appropriate. The spouse's approach aligns better with general child-rearing advice for that age group.\n"
