Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her without consent. The daughter tried telling the teachers, but it didn't help. The parent's partner is upset, thinking she should've just told the teachers instead of encouraging the child to use force.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being subjected to unwanted physical contact. The other child is 4, same age, but his behavior is concerning. The parent wants to protect their daughter, and since the teachers aren't effective, they're trying to empower the child to defend herself. The parent argues that it's legitimate force in a situation where someone is being violent, even if the child is just a peer.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Teaching a child to use physical force to defend themselves can be a valid approach in certain contexts, especially when the child is being physically harmed and other avenues (like telling adults) have failed. However, there's a balance here. At 4 years old, a child's ability to assess and respond appropriately to such situations might be limited. The parent's instruction to \"push back and run\" might escalate the conflict, leading to more aggressive behavior from the other child, as the daughter feared.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a child about consent and their right to say no is important. The parent's intention is to empower the daughter, which is commendable. But the method\u2014using physical force\u2014might not be the safest or most effective solution, especially in a daycare setting where adults are supposed to manage such interactions. The partner's concern is valid because encouraging violence, even in self-defense, could lead to more problems, and there's a risk that the child might overuse this advice in inappropriate situations.\n\nAdditionally, the parent mentions that they've been strict about non-violence in general, which suggests they are aware of the potential for misuse. However, the daycare's role is to manage children's interactions, and if the teachers aren't addressing the issue, there might be a need for more direct communication with the daycare or the other child's parents, rather than relying on the child to handle it physically.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and child-rearing practices, many experts advocate for teaching children to use their words, seek help from adults, and avoid physical retaliation. However, in cases where a child is being physically harmed and is unable to get help, some might argue that self-defense is necessary. The line is blurry here because the other child is also very young, so the situation isn't as clear-cut as defending against an older child or adult.\n\nThe parent's approach might be seen as overstepping because it's introducing the concept of using force to a very young child, which could lead to misunderstandings or inappropriate use. The partner's stance on non-violence is a common parenting philosophy, aiming to prevent cycles of aggression. However, the parent's concern about their child's safety and consent is equally valid.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, the method of teaching physical self-defense to a 4-year-old in this context might not be the most appropriate. There's a risk of encouraging aggression rather than teaching communication and seeking help through proper channels. Therefore, the parent could be considered at fault for not considering safer alternatives and for potentially escalating the situation.\n"
