Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent says the child is doing this even after being told by teachers and the daughter has tried to stop him but he doesn't listen. The parent's advice is to push back or run and tell an adult if necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and how to handle conflicts is still developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a common approach. But some might argue that teaching even a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, could set a bad precedent or lead to more aggression.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about encouraging violence, even if it's defensive. However, the parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" in a situation where the other child is being overly aggressive. The parent also mentions that they are otherwise strict about not using violence, so this is a specific scenario.\n\nI should also think about the daycare environment. If the teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, maybe the parent's advice is a way to empower the child to protect herself. But is teaching a 4-year-old to push back appropriate? Maybe the parent's approach is reasonable given the circumstances, but others might think the child should be taught to use words, seek help immediately, or not engage physically at all.\n\nAnother angle: the child is being taught to assert her boundaries, which is important. However, physical retaliation might escalate the situation. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is a good part of the response. The parent isn't encouraging aggression but self-defense.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people believe that children should not be taught to use any form of violence, while others think it's important to teach them to stand up for themselves. The key here is that the parent is not promoting random violence but specific, self-defense actions when the other child is being overly aggressive and not respecting the daughter's wishes.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent might not be in the wrong. They are trying to protect their child's well-being by teaching her to defend herself in a harmful situation. However, there's a balance between self-defense and instilling aggressive behavior. Since the parent is also emphasizing running away and reporting, it's a controlled approach. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's reasoning seems justified given the repeated incidents and lack of teacher intervention. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
