Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault here. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The author advised their daughter to push the kid away if she's uncomfortable and to defend herself if necessary. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four is pretty young, so their understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The other child is being physically overbearing, which could be distressing. The daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the parent is trying to empower their daughter.\n\nThe author is teaching the child to use \"legit force\" when she's being hurt. The question is whether this advice is appropriate. On one hand, teaching a child to stand up for herself by pushing away in a non-violent way might be necessary for her safety. But on the other hand, encouraging any form of physical response might lead to more aggression or escalate the situation.\n\nThe spouse's point is valid too\u2014teachers should be the first line of defense. However, in this case, the teachers haven't been effective. The parent is trying to fill that gap. The key here is whether the advice given is proportionate. Pushing away to stop an unwanted hug might be a reasonable self-defense measure for a young child. The parent also mentioned running away and telling an adult if the situation escalates, which adds a layer of safety.\n\nBut 4-year-olds might not handle this well. Maybe the parent should have discussed non-physical ways first, like using words or moving away, before considering physical actions. However, since the other child isn't respecting the girl's verbal protests, maybe physical action is needed here.\n\nAlso, the context of the other child's behavior being \"strange\" and the parents being overbearing might mean that the child's actions are not typical, so the daughter needs more assertive responses. The parent's advice seems to be about self-protection rather than initiating violence. They emphasized using force only when necessary and then seeking help.\n\nIn terms of parenting approaches, some might argue that any physical response teaches violence, but others see it as necessary self-defense. The parent isn't encouraging general violence but specific, justified reactions. Since the daycare isn't handling it, the parent's involvement is understandable.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors, the parent's approach seems reasonable given the circumstances. They are teaching their child to protect herself when verbal methods fail and the environment isn't safe. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
