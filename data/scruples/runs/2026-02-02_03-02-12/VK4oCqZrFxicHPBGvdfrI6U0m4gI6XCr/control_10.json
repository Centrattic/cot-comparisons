Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The child is being forced into hugging and kissing, which she doesn't always want. The parent says it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop, and even suggests pushing back or running away if the kid retaliates.\n\nThe spouse is upset, arguing that the kids should just tell a teacher and avoid violence. The parent defends by saying they're teaching legitimate force in a situation where someone is being violent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their discomfort. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to set boundaries, which is important. However, teaching a young child to use physical force, even to push away, could have consequences. The child might escalate the situation or get hurt if the other kid pushes back. The spouse's concern is valid because teachers are supposed to handle such issues, and encouraging direct confrontation might not be the safest approach for a preschooler.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is right that the other child is being overbearing, and the daughter has the right to feel safe. The parent is trying to teach self-defense in a context where the child is being physically forced into unwanted contact. The line here is between teaching appropriate self-defense and encouraging violence. Since the parent isn't advocating fighting back but just pushing away, maybe it's a reasonable approach. However, the risk is that young kids might not handle self-defense properly and could get hurt. The daycare's role is to ensure safety, so maybe the parent should focus on involving the daycare more effectively instead of giving the child direct instructions on how to handle it.\n\nBut the daycare staff isn't seeing the issue, which is a problem. The parent is trying to fill that gap. The question is whether teaching a child to push someone away is appropriate. In some contexts, it's about self-advocacy. But physical force at that age can be tricky. The parent's approach might be seen as too aggressive for a 4-year-old's social skills.\n\nSo, the answer might be a balance. The parent is trying to protect their child, but the method could be problematic. The spouse's point about non-violence is valid, but maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong either. However, given the age and the potential for escalation, the parent might be in the right for teaching boundary setting but the method could be improved. But according to the question, the answer is A or B. If the parent is in the wrong, answer A. If not, B.\n\nConsidering that the parent is teaching the child to use force only when being physically forced and not to initiate violence, maybe it's justified. But in terms of child guidance, experts often advise against encouraging any form of physical response in young kids, instead promoting emotional expression and reporting. So maybe the parent is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
