Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is talking about their 4-year-old daughter being uncomfortably hugged and kissed by another kid at daycare. The daughter has already reported this to the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent advised the daughter to push the other kid away if he's being too forceful, and even suggested pushing back or running away if the other kid reacts violently. The spouse is upset, thinking it's better to just report it to the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, first, the situation involves a child being subjected to unwanted physical contact. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent's concern is valid because the child's safety and comfort are at stake. Teaching the child self-defense in a controlled manner might be appropriate, especially if the other child is not responsive to verbal cues. However, at 4 years old, the child's ability to handle a physical confrontation might be limited. The parent's advice includes using force but also running away and telling an adult, which shows they're not encouraging general violence. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, which is a common worry. But the parent is emphasizing \"legit violence\" in self-defense. It's a balance between teaching the child to protect herself and ensuring she doesn't escalate the situation. The daycare's role is also a factor here\u2014they should ideally address the other child's behavior more effectively. So, the parent's approach seems reasonable given the circumstances, especially since it's about preventing harm and teaching the child to respond to a specific threat. The answer might be B, but I need to consider if advising a 4-year-old to push someone back is too much. However, the parent is being cautious and giving options, so maybe it's okay.\n"
