Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her violently. The parent and spouse had a fight over this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter is being uncomfortably hugged and kissed by another child, even after she tells him to stop. The parents have already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away if he's hurting her and not listening. The spouse thinks they should rely on telling adults instead of using violence.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is wrong. The parent's reasoning is about defending their child from unwanted physical contact, teaching her to protect herself. The spouse's concern is about encouraging violence, even if minor.\n\nAt 4 years old, children are learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. Encouraging a child to push someone might be seen as teaching self-defense, but it could also escalate the situation. However, the parent is not teaching general violence but specific, defensive actions when the child is being forced. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" and then running to an adult.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to set boundaries is important. On the other hand, physical response might not be the best solution for a young child. The parent might be right in wanting to protect their child from discomfort, but the spouse's concern about promoting violence is valid too. The key is whether the parent's advice is proportionate and appropriate for a 4-year-old's understanding and the situation. It's a balance between self-advocacy and non-violent conflict resolution. The answer might depend on cultural norms and parenting styles, but generally, encouraging a child to assertively stop unwanted contact without overstepping could be acceptable. However, the use of physical force, even minor, might be seen as instilling aggression. So, maybe the parent is somewhat in the right, but there's a gray area. Alternatively, the parent is not wrong because the child's safety and comfort are priorities, and they are teaching appropriate self-defense measures.\n"
