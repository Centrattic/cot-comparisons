Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is a 4-year-old who's being hugged too forcefully by another kid, sometimes kissing her. The daughter told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent advised her to push the other kid away if she's uncomfortable, and even to push back or run away if the other kid reacts. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from uncomfortable or harmful situations. The other child's behavior is described as \"violent hugging\" and forced kisses. The parent is teaching their daughter to defend herself in a situation where she's being harmed. At 4, children might not have the verbal skills to stop someone else's unwanted physical contact, so using physical force to push away might be a reasonable immediate response. However, the parent also mentions that they are strict about not using violence otherwise, so it's a specific case of self-defense.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about teaching violence. But the parent isn't encouraging random aggression; it's in a specific context of legitimate defense. The key points are whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old and if it's the best approach. The teachers aren't effectively stopping the behavior, so the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. On the other hand, teaching a child to use physical force could lead to escalation, as the other child might retaliate, which the daughter even mentions. The parent advises pushing back and running away, which is a mix of self-defense and seeking help. \n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds might not handle physical confrontations well, and there's a risk of the other child getting hurt or the situation getting worse. The parent might be underestimating the child's ability to handle it, but the alternative of only relying on telling a teacher isn't working. The parent is trying to balance immediate safety with teaching appropriate behavior. \n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a tough call. They're trying to protect their child in a situation where the system (teachers) isn't working. But teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might not be the best approach. Maybe there are other non-violent ways to address it, like practicing verbal responses or working more closely with the daycare to monitor the other child. However, given the immediacy of the issue and the child's age, the parent might not expect the daughter to handle it verbally every time. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child is being violent, so it's a form of self-defense instruction. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions are well-intentioned, aiming to protect their daughter in a scenario where the child is being physically overwhelmed. While there are potential downsides, the parent is addressing a real problem with a practical solution for a young child's understanding. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent isn't promoting violence without cause. Therefore, the answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
