Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is trying to figure out if they did the right thing by telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and even kissing her without consent. The other kid doesn't stop when she yells, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent's reasoning is that it's legitimate force to protect herself, especially since the other child's actions are violent and non-consensual. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to report it and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent's advice is practical in that it gives the child a strategy to handle an immediate threat. However, teaching a child to use physical force could have downsides, like escalating the situation or leading to more aggression. On the other hand, teaching self-defense is part of safety education, especially if there's a persistent issue that adults aren't managing effectively.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The other child's behavior is clearly non-consensual and potentially harmful. The parent is teaching their daughter to assert her boundaries physically, which could be necessary if verbal communication isn't working. But there's also the aspect of teaching non-violence, which the parent acknowledges, so they're not encouraging general violence but rather a specific response to unwanted physical contact.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid too. Relying on adults to intervene is usually the safer approach, but in this case, the teachers aren't effective. The child might not feel safe or empowered to keep reporting if the adults aren't responsive. The parent's approach ensures the child has a way to protect herself in the immediate moment.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing the child's safety and autonomy, teaching her to recognize and defend against unwanted touch. It's a balance between teaching non-violence and ensuring safety. Since the other child's actions are violent and non-consensual, the parent's advice is a form of self-defense education. However, it's also important to continue working with the daycare to address the behavior properly. So the answer isn't black and white, but given the circumstances, the parent's action seems reasonable.\n"
