Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The daughter has already tried telling the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is using force and not respecting her boundaries, she can push back. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to report and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, her ability to assess a situation and use self-defense might be limited. But the parent is saying it's okay to push in cases of forceful contact that's making her uncomfortable. The key here is that the other child isn't stopping when told, so the daughter's safety is a concern.\n\nThe spouse's concern is that using violence could escalate the situation. But the parent isn't advocating for aggression; it's about setting boundaries. The question is whether teaching a child to use physical resistance in such a situation is appropriate. \n\nIn many cases, educators and child development experts recommend teaching children to set boundaries through words first, then seek help. However, when the other child doesn't respond to verbal cues, the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself. \n\nBut there's a risk that the child might not fully grasp the difference between defensive actions and aggression. Also, there's a potential for escalation. The parent is trying to equip the child with tools to handle an immediate threat, while the spouse prefers a non-violent approach. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tricky scenario. On one hand, protecting the child's autonomy and safety is crucial. On the other hand, encouraging physical confrontation could lead to more problems. The parent's advice seems to be about self-defense rather than aggression, so maybe they're not wrong. But some might argue that even this encouragement could be problematic for a young child. However, the parent is emphasizing that it's only in cases of force and not for general violence. \n\nI think the parent's approach is reasonable given the context. They're not promoting violence for any reason, just in specific cases of unwanted force. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
