Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and not stopping when she tells him to. The parents are in conflict over whether it's okay to use physical force in this situation.\n\nFirst, the child is in daycare, and there's another kid who's being overly aggressive with hugs and kisses, not respecting the daughter's boundaries. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid is causing her harm. The spouse argues that violence isn't the answer and that they should rely on adults. \n\nSo, from a parenting perspective, there's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violence. The daughter is young, so using physical force might escalate things, but the parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety. \n\nThe key points here are: the other child's behavior is persistent and not stopping when asked, the teachers aren't effectively addressing it, and the parent is giving their daughter a way to protect herself in a situation where she's being hurt. \n\nI think the parent is right to teach the daughter to set physical boundaries, especially when the child is in a vulnerable position and the adults aren't intervening enough. However, there's a concern about modeling violence. But in this case, it's about self-defense against unwanted force. So maybe the parent isn't at fault here. The answer might be B for No.\n"
