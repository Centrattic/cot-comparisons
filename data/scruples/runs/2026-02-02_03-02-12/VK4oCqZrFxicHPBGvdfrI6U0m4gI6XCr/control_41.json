Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard, even to the point of kissing her and not stopping when told. The parent and their SO are arguing about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable with another child's behavior. The parents have already told the teachers, but the teachers aren't seeing it, and the other kid isn't stopping. The parent is advising their daughter to use physical force to defend herself if she's being hurt. The SO thinks it's better to rely on adults rather than using violence.\n\nSo, the key points here: teaching a child self-defense versus non-violence. At 4 years old, the child is very young. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when others aren't stopping the behavior. However, there's a concern about encouraging violence in children. But the situation seems to be about preventing harm (unwanted physical contact) rather than just fighting over something trivial.\n\nIn many child-rearing philosophies, teaching children to set boundaries is important. However, the approach might vary. Some might argue that even at 4, a child can be taught to say \"no\" or to go to an adult, rather than using physical force. Others might agree that in cases of ongoing unwanted contact, especially where adults aren't intervening, some self-assertion is necessary.\n\nBut the parent is specifically talking about pushing away, not hitting or aggressive behavior. The parent also mentions they are strict about not encouraging violence otherwise. The line between self-defense and initiating violence can be thin. The child is in a situation where she's being forced into physical contact that she doesn't want, and the other child isn't respecting her verbal cues. If the parent's advice is to push away to stop the immediate discomfort, that might be seen as reasonable. However, teaching a child to use physical force could set a precedent for future conflicts. The SO's concern is valid about encouraging the child to use violence, even if it's for self-defense.\n\nBut the parent is differentiating between \"legit violence\" and regular play. The situation here is about a child being physically forced into contact that they don't want, which is a form of aggression. Allowing the child to defend herself in that moment might be necessary when adults aren't able to help. However, the parent might also be overestimating the child's ability to handle such a situation. The 4-year-old might not have the judgment to differentiate between a situation where pushing is okay versus another. There's also the risk of escalating the situation, as the child mentioned the other kid might push back.\n\nSo, the parent's advice has good intentions, but there's a potential downside. The correct approach might be to reinforce the child's ability to say \"no\" and to immediately seek help from an adult, rather than using physical force. The parent might be in the right in trying to protect their child's boundaries, but maybe the method isn't the best. However, since the teachers aren't effective, and the child is in danger of being harmed, the parent's advice could be justified as a last resort.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often a push to teach non-violence, but also to respect personal boundaries. The answer might be a balance. The parent is not entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, the question is whether the parent is \"in the wrong\". The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to protect their child in a situation where adults aren't helping. However, some might argue that even in this case, teaching a child to use violence is setting a bad example. But since the situation is about defending against unwanted physical contact, it's a legitimate form of self-defense. So, the parent is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
