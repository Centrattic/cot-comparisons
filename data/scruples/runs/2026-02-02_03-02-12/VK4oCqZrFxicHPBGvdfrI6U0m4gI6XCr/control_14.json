Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the behavior hasn't stopped. The parent argues that it's okay to use \"legit force\" when someone is being violent and not respecting her boundaries. The spouse disagrees, thinks she should just tell a teacher and not use violence at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being physically aggressive, hugging too hard and kissing her without consent. The daughter is being taught that she can push back if the other kid doesn't stop. The parent's reasoning is that it's self-defense in a situation where the child isn't respecting boundaries. But the spouse is concerned about teaching violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are: age of the child, teaching self-defense vs. encouraging violence, the role of adults in such situations, and whether a 4-year-old can understand the difference between necessary force and aggression.\n\nAt 4 years old, kids are still learning social cues and boundaries. Pushing someone back might escalate the situation, especially if the other child is also not mature enough to understand. The parent might be trying to empower their daughter to assert her boundaries, which is good, but using physical force could set a precedent for resolving conflicts with violence. However, the parent isn't teaching her to beat the other kid up, just to push away when being forced into uncomfortable contact. \n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use violence, even in self-defense, can be problematic. But the parent is trying to address a situation where the child is being physically overwhelmed and the adults (teachers) aren't able to intervene effectively. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to defend oneself when someone else is being aggressive. \n\nBut then again, for a 4-year-old, the appropriate response might be to tell an adult, not to push. The parent might be giving the daughter a tool that could lead to more conflict. However, the daughter is already in a situation where telling adults hasn't worked, so the parent is trying to give her another option.\n\nThe line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence is thin here. The parent's approach could be seen as appropriate if the force is minimal and only used to stop immediate harm. But if the child starts using that as a way to handle conflicts generally, it might become an issue. The parent is also aware of this and mentions that they're straight with their child about violence otherwise.\n\nIn terms of developmental appropriateness, a 4-year-old might not fully grasp when to push back and when not to. They might use that as an excuse to push others during normal play. The spouse's approach of relying on adults might be safer, but given the failure of the teachers to intervene, the parent is trying to find a solution.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, it's a tough call. The parent's intention is to help their child protect herself in a harmful situation, which is understandable. However, the method of teaching to push back could be problematic. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the right, as they're addressing immediate safety and consent, but the spouse's concern about violence is also valid. The key is whether the parent is teaching the child to use only the minimal necessary force to stop the immediate issue, which in this case is forceful hugs and kisses. If the parent is clear that it's only in those specific situations and not for general behavior, maybe it's okay. But there's a risk that the child might overuse it. \n\nOverall, I think the parent isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern. However, the spouse's point about relying on adults and avoiding violence is also important. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and specific parenting styles. But given the context, the parent is probably not in the wrong. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
