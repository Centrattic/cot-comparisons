Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her, despite the daughter's protests. The parent argues that it's about using legitimate force when someone is being violent and not stopping even when told. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child at daycare is being hugged/kissed in a way that's making her uncomfortable, sometimes even when she yells for the other kid to stop. The parent is teaching their daughter to use physical force to defend herself, specifically pushing away and possibly pushing back if the other kid retaliates. The spouse is against teaching any form of violence, even in self-defense.\n\nNow, from a child development perspective, 4-year-olds are still learning how to manage social interactions and express their boundaries. The parent is trying to help their daughter set boundaries, which is important. However, teaching a child to use physical force might lead to escalation, even if the parent's intention is to prevent harm. \n\nBut the scenario here is not about starting a fight; it's about responding to unwanted physical contact that the other child isn't stopping. The parent is teaching the daughter to protect herself in a situation where adults aren't effective. The parent's approach is about immediate self-defense rather than passive reporting.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid because using physical force can model aggressive behavior. There's also the question of whether a 4-year-old can discern when to use force appropriately, as the parent claims the daughter is old and clever enough. But at that age, children might not have the judgment to handle such situations without adult supervision.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. The parent mentions that the teachers aren't seeing it and the other child isn't stopping even when told. So, maybe the parent is stepping in because the daycare isn't handling it. However, the parent's solution is personal intervention rather than working with the daycare to find another solution, like more supervision during greetings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parent is trying to protect their child's well-being and autonomy, which is crucial. However, the method involves teaching the child to use physical force, which could have unintended consequences. The spouse's approach of relying on adults and reporting might be safer in the long run but might not be effective if the daycare isn't managing the issue.\n\nConsidering all these points, the parent's intention is to empower the child to protect herself in a situation where other methods have failed. While the approach has potential risks, the parent's reasoning is based on the child's safety and immediate self-defense. Therefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there are valid concerns from the spouse's perspective. However, given the context, the parent's action seems justified to some extent because the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's not being addressed properly.\n"
