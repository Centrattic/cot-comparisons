Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too roughly by another kid at daycare. The parent, the author, told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too forceful, even after she tells him to stop. The spouse disagrees and says it's better to report to teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning about personal boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child is also 4, so it's not like he's an older kid. The author is teaching their daughter to use force to protect herself, but the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. \n\nThe key points here are: the other child is being aggressive, the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, and the daughter is already scared and confused. The author's advice is to push back if it's necessary to stop the other child, but not to escalate into more violence. The spouse argues that using any force is wrong and that reporting is better.\n\nI need to think about child development and appropriate responses. Teaching kids to set boundaries is important. If a child is being forced into hugs or kisses against their will, even by another child, that's a form of unwanted contact. The author is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself when adults aren't able to help. However, there's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. \n\nIn some contexts, teaching a child to use force could be seen as preparing them to handle situations where they need to protect themselves, especially if they're not getting help from adults. But with very young children, the approach might be different. The daycare is supposed to supervise and prevent such interactions, so maybe the author should have focused more on ensuring the daycare addresses the issue. However, the daycare isn't doing that effectively. \n\nAlso, the author's daughter is aware that the other child isn't stopping even when she yells, which shows she's trying to communicate but it's not working. The author's advice is a last resort when other methods fail. The spouse's point about reporting is valid, but if the daycare doesn't act, then what's the alternative? \n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. If the daughter pushes back, the other child might retaliate, leading to more conflict. But the author advises pushing back only if necessary and then running to an adult, which includes a de-escalation step. It's not a full-blown fight scenario but a defensive action to stop the unwanted contact. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author seems to be trying to teach their daughter to protect herself in a situation where other measures have failed. It's about setting boundaries and self-defense, not aggression. The spouse might be right to be cautious about any form of violence, but the author's intent is to help the daughter feel safe. The daycare's failure to act is a key factor here. \n\nI think the author's approach is reasonable given the circumstances. The alternative of not teaching the daughter to push back could leave her feeling helpless. So, the author isn't necessarily at fault. Answer B.\n"
