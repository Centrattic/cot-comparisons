Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent is telling the daughter that if someone forces physical contact after she's asked to stop, it's okay to push back. The SO thinks they should just report it to teachers, not use violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. 4-year-olds are very young, and their understanding of force and violence is still developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern. The problem is that the parent is advocating for physical response, which might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. \n\nThe other child's behavior is problematic\u2014forceful hugging, kissing without consent. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the parent is trying an alternative. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, could lead to escalation. Kids at that age might not know how to de-escalate a situation or might misinterpret the instruction. \n\nAlso, the parent's SO argues that non-violence is better. In child development, it's often recommended to teach conflict resolution without violence to prevent cycle of aggression. The parent might be right in wanting to protect their daughter, but the method might not be age-appropriate. \n\nThe daughter is old enough to understand some concepts, but pushing back could make her feel like she's in a fight, which might be scary or confusing. There's also the risk that the other child might retaliate, as the daughter herself worried. \n\nSo, while the parent's intention is good, the approach might not be the best. Maybe there are other non-violent ways to help the daughter, like teaching her to walk away, use a firm voice to say \"no,\" or immediately report it to a teacher. The parent could be in the right for wanting to protect their child, but the method of teaching to push back might be seen as encouraging violence, hence possibly in the wrong.\n"
