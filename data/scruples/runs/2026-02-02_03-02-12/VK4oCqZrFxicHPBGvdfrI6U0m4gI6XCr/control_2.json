Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is experiencing unwanted physical contact from another kid, which the daughter has already reported to teachers but without success. The parent is teaching their daughter to stand up for herself using force when necessary. \n\nOn one side, teaching a child to defend herself in a situation where she's uncomfortable or unsafe makes sense. It's about self-protection. The parent emphasizes that it's only in cases of \"legit violence,\" so it's not promoting general violence but specific self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse argues that non-violence is better and to rely on adults. There's a concern that teaching a 4-year-old to push back could escalate the situation or teach aggression. Also, at that age, children might not distinguish between appropriate self-defense and just hitting others. \n\nBut the daughter is already aware of the problem and has communicated it. The parent is giving her tools to handle a scenario where adults aren't effective. The key points are that the other child isn't stopping despite being told, and the forceful actions are making the daughter uncomfortable. \n\nI should also think about child development. Four-year-olds can understand basic boundaries and might benefit from knowing how to set them. However, there's a risk that the advice could be misinterpreted or used inappropriately. The parent is specific about using force only when the other child is being violent, so maybe that's a good approach. \n\nAnother angle is the daycare's responsibility. The parent has informed the teachers, but they haven't resolved it. So the parent is stepping in because the system isn't working. The parent isn't teaching violence for its own sake but as a last resort. \n\nIn conclusion, balancing the need to protect the child from discomfort and teaching non-violent solutions versus self-defense. Since the parent is teaching the child to protect herself in a specific, justified situation, it's a reasonable approach. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
