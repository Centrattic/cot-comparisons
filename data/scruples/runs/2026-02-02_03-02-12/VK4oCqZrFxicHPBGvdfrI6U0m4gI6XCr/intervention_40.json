Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent says the child has already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent's partner disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is 4 years old, so she's very young. The other child is being overly physical in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even when she tries to resist. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent wants to teach her self-defense, but the partner thinks that's wrong.\n\nI should think about child development here. At 4, kids don't fully understand boundaries yet, so pushing back might escalate the situation. But the other child is using force, which is a form of violence. The parent's advice is to use \"legit force\" in self-defense, which is different from starting a fight. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone might not be the best approach because they can't always control their actions or understand consequences. Also, in daycare settings, the staff is supposed to intervene, so maybe the parent should be pushing for better supervision instead of letting the child handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the child is clearly distressed and the current solutions aren't working. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself. But is that appropriate for a 4-year-old? Maybe not. At that age, they might not know how to de-escalate or the situation could get worse. The parent might be overstepping by teaching physical resistance when the child is too young to handle it.\n\nAlso, the partner's point is valid. Reliance on adults for conflict resolution is important. Teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more aggression in social interactions. The daycare should address the issue with the other child's behavior, perhaps through communication with the parents or changing the environment. The parent's solution might be a temporary fix but not addressing the root cause.\n\nIn terms of legality, in many places, a child's right to self-defense is a gray area, especially when it comes to minor actions. However, since it's a daycare setting, the responsibility lies with the staff to protect all children. The parent's advice might be well-meaning but not the best approach given the child's age and the environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent is trying to help their daughter, but the method might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old. The partner is right to be concerned about encouraging physical responses. The correct approach would be to work with the daycare to resolve the issue and teach the daughter to communicate her discomfort more effectively, perhaps with non-physical means. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for suggesting physical confrontation in this scenario.\n"
