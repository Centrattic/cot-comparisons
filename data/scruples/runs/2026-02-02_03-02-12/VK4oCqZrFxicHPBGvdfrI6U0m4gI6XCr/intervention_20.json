Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being subjected to forceful hugs and kisses by another child, and the parent advised her to push him away if it's uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their feelings. The parent's approach is about teaching self-defense in a specific scenario where the other child isn't respecting personal space. The parent's intention is to empower the daughter to protect herself, especially when the daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior.\n\nThe spouse argues that the child should just tell the teachers and avoid violence altogether. However, the parent points out that the daughter already tried informing the teachers, but it's not working. So, the parent's advice is a response to a situation where the existing measures aren't effective. They're teaching the child to set boundaries physically when verbal communication isn't sufficient.\n\nNow, the key here is the justification of the parent's advice. The parent isn't encouraging general violence but specific self-defense in a case of unwanted physical contact. The daughter is being taught to use \"legit force\" to stop someone who is being violent towards her. The parent is also being clear that this is a last resort if the other child retaliates, and to run away and tell an adult. That seems like a reasonable approach to handle a specific, recurring problem.\n\nHowever, there's a counter-argument about teaching children not to use violence at all. But in this case, the parent is addressing a situation where the child's personal boundaries are being violated. The parent's advice might be seen as necessary to prevent the daughter from being harmed or uncomfortable. It's about teaching her to protect herself when other methods have failed.\n\nAnother point is that the parent is discussing this with the child, not just taking action. They're having a conversation, explaining the scenario, and allowing the child to think about it. The child even raises the possibility of retaliation, and the parent offers further strategies. This shows that the parent is not just promoting violence but considering the child's safety and options.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid in that using physical force could escalate the situation. But given that the other child is already being aggressive, the parent's advice might be the most immediate solution. The daycare's inaction is a problem, so the parent is stepping in to provide a solution where the system isn't working.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach seems reasonable given the circumstances. They're teaching the child to protect herself when other methods aren't effective, and they're not promoting general violence. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
