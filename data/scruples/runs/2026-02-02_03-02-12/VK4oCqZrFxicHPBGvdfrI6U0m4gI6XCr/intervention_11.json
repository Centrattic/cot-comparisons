Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. The parents are in a disagreement: one parent says it's okay for the kid to push back if she's being harmed, while the SO thinks she should only report it and not use violence.\n\nFirst, the situation: the other kid is being overly physical, not respecting boundaries, even after being told by teachers. The daughter is trying to communicate that she's uncomfortable, but the other child doesn't stop. The author's approach is to teach her to use force if necessary to protect herself, but only in cases where she's being harmed and can't get help otherwise.\n\nNow, considering child development and appropriate behavior for a 4-year-old. At that age, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to communicate their needs. The author is teaching her daughter a form of self-defense, but in a limited way\u2014to push away if someone is being violent. The alternative is that the daughter might feel unsafe and not know how to handle the situation, which could lead to long-term issues with boundaries or fear.\n\nThe spouse's concern is understandable; using any form of violence might escalate the situation or teach aggression. However, the author argues that it's about using \"legit force\" in a clear case of unwanted force. It's a question of when it's appropriate to teach a child to protect themselves versus relying solely on authority figures.\n\nIn many child protection guidelines, teaching children to say no and remove themselves from uncomfortable situations is encouraged. If a child is being physically forced, especially when they've communicated their discomfort and adults aren't intervening, it's important they feel empowered to protect themselves. Pushing back might be a short-term solution, but it's also about teaching the child that their boundaries matter.\n\nHowever, there's a balance. The author isn't advocating for general violence but specific self-defense in a case of unwanted physical contact. The daughter is already reporting to teachers, but they aren't effective. So, the author is providing an additional strategy when the first (telling adults) isn't working.\n\nI think the author is right in this context. It's about empowering the child to protect herself in a situation where she's being physically harmed and the usual channels aren't working. The approach is age-appropriate and specific to the issue at hand. The spouse's concern is valid, but the author's approach is more about teaching immediate self-defense rather than encouraging aggression. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
