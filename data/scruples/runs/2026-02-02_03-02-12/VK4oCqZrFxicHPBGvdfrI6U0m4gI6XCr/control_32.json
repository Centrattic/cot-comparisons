Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another child who's hugging her too hard and not stopping when she yells. The SO thinks the parent is wrong to encourage any form of violence, even in self-defense.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being forced into physical contact they don't want. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent is trying to teach the child to protect herself. At 4, kids are still learning boundaries and how to express discomfort. Pushing back could be a way to set immediate boundaries when other methods (telling adults) aren't working.\n\nBut the parent's SO argues against using violence. However, the parent isn't advocating for aggression, just forceful push to stop the unwanted touch. The line between violence and self-defense is thin here. The parent is teaching the child to assert herself, which might be necessary if the other child is aggressive and the adults aren't helping.\n\nBut teaching a 4-year-old to push someone could escalate the situation. The other child might push back, leading to more conflict. The parent might be overestimating the child's ability to handle it. Also, there's a risk of the child using such force inappropriately later.\n\nOn the other hand, the child has the right to feel safe. If the daycare isn't addressing it, the parent might feel compelled to teach self-defense. However, the appropriate approach might be to work with the daycare more to find a solution, like separating the children or having more supervision.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? They might be justified if they believe the child is in immediate harm, but encouraging physical resistance could have downsides. The answer isn't clear-cut. But considering the child's age and the potential for escalation, maybe the parent is overstepping. The correct approach might involve more collaboration with daycare and teaching non-physical ways to express discomfort first. So, leaning towards the parent being in the wrong.\n"
