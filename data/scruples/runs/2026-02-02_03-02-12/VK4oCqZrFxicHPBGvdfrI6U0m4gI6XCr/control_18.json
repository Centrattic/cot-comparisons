Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's giving uncomfortable hugs and kisses.\n\nFirst, the context is a daycare setting. The other child is hugging/kissing the daughter in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even after she's told the child to stop. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent's advice is to use force if the child won't stop and the situation is violent.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is about self-defense. They argue that when someone is using force against them despite their protests, it's okay to push back. The SO disagrees, suggesting non-violence and reporting to teachers. \n\nNow, considering a 4-year-old's ability to understand and handle such situations. At that age, children might not know how to handle conflict beyond what they're taught. The parent is teaching a form of self-protection, but there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation by pushing back, leading to more violence. \n\nLegally and ethically, encouraging a child to use physical force could be problematic. Even if it's in self-defense, teaching a child to resolve conflicts with violence might not be the best approach. Daycare staff are supposed to handle such issues, and parents might be expected to work with the daycare first. \n\nHowever, the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern. The key here is whether the parent's advice is reasonable for a 4-year-old. At that age, children often act impulsively. Teaching them to push back might lead to more harm, like the other child retaliating. \n\nAlso, the daycare's role is to manage children's behavior. The parent might have a point in thinking the daycare isn't doing their job, but advising a child to use force could be seen as not trusting the daycare's authority and possibly escalating the problem. \n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds are still learning social skills. The parent's approach might be too advanced for the child's understanding, leading to unintended consequences. The alternative is teaching non-violent responses, like asking the teachers more insistently or using words, which are safer and more age-appropriate.\n\nSo, balancing the parent's intent to protect their child against the potential risks of encouraging violence, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because they're promoting a violent response in a situation that should ideally be handled by adults.\n"
