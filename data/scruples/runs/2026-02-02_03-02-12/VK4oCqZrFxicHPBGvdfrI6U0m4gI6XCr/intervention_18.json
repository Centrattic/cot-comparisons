Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her violently. The kid in question is aggressive, kissing her and not stopping even when she yells. The parents have already told the teachers, but that's not working. The author told their daughter it's okay to push back or run away if needed. The spouse is upset, thinking it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 4, so young. The other child is being physically aggressive, which is a form of violence. The author is trying to teach self-defense in a situation where the child is being harmed. The spouse argues against using any form of violence, even in self-defense.\n\nThe key points here are: the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, the teachers haven't resolved it, and the author is giving the child tools to protect herself. But the spouse thinks non-violence is always better. \n\nI need to think about child development and appropriate responses. At 4 years old, a child can be taught to set boundaries. However, encouraging physical retaliation might escalate the situation. The author's approach is to use \"legit force,\" which could mean just enough to stop the harm. The spouse's concern is about instilling violence, even if justified.\n\nAnother angle is the safety of the child. If the child feels empowered to stop the immediate threat, that's important. But teaching a 4-year-old to push back might lead to more conflict. Also, the child's fear of being pushed back by the other kid is valid. The parent's advice to run and tell an adult is a good backup plan.\n\nLegally, teaching self-defense isn't wrong, but the appropriateness for a 4-year-old is tricky. The line between self-defense and violence is thin at that age. The parent is trying to protect their child from harm, which is a priority. However, the parent's method might be seen as promoting physical aggression, which could have long-term effects.\n\nThe daycare's role is also a factor. If the teachers aren't addressing it, the parent might feel they need to step in. But parents should coordinate with daycare to ensure consistent messages. The spouse might feel the parent is overstepping by not relying on daycare's intervention.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parent's intention is to protect, which is valid. The spouse's concern is about the method, promoting non-violence. Both have valid points. But considering the child's safety and the immediate threat, the author might not be in the wrong. However, using physical force as a solution for a 4-year-old could be seen as inappropriate. Maybe there are better ways, like teaching the child to say \"no\" louder or to immediately go to a teacher. But since the teachers aren't effective, the parent's approach is a reaction to that failure.\n\nI think the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to protect their child from harm. But the method could be debated. So the answer is B.\n"
