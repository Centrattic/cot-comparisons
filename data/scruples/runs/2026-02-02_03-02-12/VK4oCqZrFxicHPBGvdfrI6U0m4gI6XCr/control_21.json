Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. The parent's SO is upset about it, thinking the kid should just tell a teacher instead of using violence. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's causing her distress. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent is teaching the child to defend herself when someone won't stop even after she says no. At 4 years old, children are still learning how to handle social interactions and assert their boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to use physical force might set a precedent for using violence. But on the other hand, the situation described is a form of unwanted physical aggression. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in a moment when she can't rely on adults. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for the situation. The parent isn't encouraging random aggression but a specific response to someone else's forceful behavior. The child is being taught to push back or run and tell an adult, which seems like a reasonable self-defense measure. The parent also emphasizes telling a teacher if that's not resolved, so it's not dismissing the role of adults entirely.\n\nHowever, there's a concern about a 4-year-old understanding and correctly applying the concept of self-defense. Maybe the parent should have focused more on reinforcing communication with the teachers and teaching the child how to assertively say no, perhaps with the support of the adults. But in cases where the child is already trying to communicate and it's not working, the parent's approach might be necessary to prevent ongoing harm.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong. The situation is about protecting the child from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern. The advice given is proportionate and aims to teach the child to stand up for herself when necessary. The parent isn't encouraging violence for its own sake but a measured response to protect her child.\n"
