Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push another kid away when the other child is hugging too forcefully. The situation involves a daycare scenario where the other kid's parents are described as overbearing, and the teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense, but the spouse disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old might not fully understand the concept of appropriate boundaries or consequences. The parent is teaching the child to use force if the other child is being violent. But at such a young age, kids often don't have the judgment to assess when force is necessary. They might escalate the situation or misinterpret the other child's actions. \n\nThen there's the aspect of teaching violence as a response. Even if it's in self-defense, encouraging physical retaliation could set a precedent. The spouse argues that non-violent solutions, like telling a teacher, are better. Daycare environments usually have policies about how to handle such interactions. Maybe involving adults is the safer approach here, as the teachers are responsible for managing the kids' interactions.\n\nAlso, the other child's behavior might be due to lack of social skills or parental guidance. The parent's approach could lead to a cycle of conflict between the kids. The daycare teachers might need to be more proactive in setting boundaries and educating both children about personal space.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from discomfort and unwanted physical contact. It's reasonable to want to teach a child to assert their boundaries. However, the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best strategy for a 4-year-old. The parent might have better alternatives, like role-playing how to say \"no\" or using words, and ensuring the daycare staff are more vigilant.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is good, but the method might not be age-appropriate. The spouse's concern about promoting violence is valid. The right approach might be finding a balance between teaching the child to express discomfort non-violently and ensuring the daycare handles the situation properly. Therefore, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong because teaching a young child to use physical force could lead to more issues and isn't the best solution for their age.\n"
