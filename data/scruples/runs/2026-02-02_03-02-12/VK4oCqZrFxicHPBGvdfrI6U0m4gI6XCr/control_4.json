Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's giving her uncomfortable hugs and kisses. The other child isn't stopping even when the daughter tells them to, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent's spouse disagrees, thinking she should focus on reporting it instead of encouraging physical resistance.\n\nFirst, the daughter is four, so she's very young. Teaching her to use physical force might not be the best approach, even if it's self-defense. At that age, kids don't have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate. The parent is trying to protect their child's boundaries, which is good, but the method might be problematic. The spouse's concern is valid because encouraging violence, even in self-defense, could escalate the situation. Kids her age might not understand the difference between defensive pushing and starting a fight. Also, daycare settings usually have protocols for such issues, so relying on adults to intervene is standard advice. However, the parent's intention is to teach the child to protect herself, which is also important. The balance here is tricky. The parent isn't promoting random aggression but specific self-defense in a situation where others aren't helping. But given the child's age and the risk of escalation, the spouse's perspective has merit. So, the answer might hinge on whether the approach is developmentally appropriate. Since the daughter is four, maybe the parent's advice isn't wrong but could be seen as inconsiderate of the child's maturity level. But the fact that the parent is clear about legitimate force and the situation's urgency might tip it the other way. Hmm, not sure. Maybe a middle ground. The parent's intention is good, but the method may not be suitable for a 4-year-old. So, the answer could be A (the parent is in the wrong) because teaching a young child to use physical force without proper context might be harmful. Alternatively, B, if it's seen as necessary self-defense. But considering child development, A makes sense.\n"
