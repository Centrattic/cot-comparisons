Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether encouraging a 4-year-old to push away another child who is hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable is the right approach. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit violence\" to defend against unwanted physical contact, while the spouse thinks it's better to rely on telling teachers and avoiding violence altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and appropriate behavior is still developing. The other child is also the same age, so it's possible that the aggressive hugging isn't intentional harm but rather an overenthusiastic way of interacting. However, the parent's daughter is clearly uncomfortable, so there's a legitimate issue here.\n\nThe parent's approach is about teaching self-defense. They told their daughter to use force if the other child won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running away. The spouse's concern is that encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, might teach the daughter that physical aggression is acceptable. There's also the risk that the situation could escalate if the other child reacts with violence, as the daughter feared.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. The teachers have been told but haven't effectively addressed the issue. The parent might feel frustrated that the problem isn't being resolved, which is why they took matters into their own hands. But is it appropriate to teach a 4-year-old to handle this themselves? At that age, children often lack the emotional and physical maturity to assess and respond to threats appropriately. They might not know how to de-escalate a situation or could misinterpret the situation entirely.\n\nAlso, the line between self-defense and aggression can be blurry for a young child. What the parent sees as justified force to stop unwanted contact might be seen by others as starting a fight. The daughter's fear that the other child might push back or beat her is a valid concern, but teaching a child to retaliate could lead to a cycle of violence.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower their child to stand up for herself and protect her own boundaries. Teaching children to recognize when they're being uncomfortable and to take action to stop it is important. However, for a 4-year-old, the safest and most effective solution might be to teach her to tell a teacher immediately and to use words to express her discomfort, rather than physical actions.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the daycare is handling the situation. If the teachers aren't paying attention or aren't effective, maybe the parent should escalate the issue to the daycare management or consider involving child protective services if the behavior is truly abusive. But the question is about the parent's advice to their child, not the daycare's role.\n\nIn terms of developmental appropriateness, 4-year-olds are still learning to communicate their needs and emotions. Physical responses might be more instinctual for them. However, encouraging physical reactions could be seen as modeling behavior that's not conducive to peaceful conflict resolution. The spouse's point about relying on adults for help is probably more in line with teaching the child to seek help from authority figures, which is a critical lesson.\n\nBut the parent's argument is that the teachers aren't addressing the issue, so the child needs to take some initiative. That might be a valid concern, but maybe the solution is to work more closely with the daycare rather than instructing the child to use force. The parent could also model non-violent conflict resolution strategies, like using clear \"no\" statements or seeking help.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are to protect their daughter and teach her to stand up for herself, the approach might not be the most effective or safe for a child of that age. The spouse's concern about avoiding violence is valid because physical retaliation can lead to more harm. The situation might be better handled by reinforcing non-violent communication and ensuring the daycare is properly addressing the issue. So, the parent could be in the wrong for encouraging physical force without considering the child's age and the potential risks involved.\n"
