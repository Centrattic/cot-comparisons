Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent did the wrong thing by advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent believes the child has a right to defend herself in such a situation, especially since the daycare teachers aren't stopping it. The spouse disagrees, thinking the child should only tell the teachers and avoid any form of violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and the context. A 4-year-old might not fully understand the consequences of their actions, but the parent is teaching her to recognize when someone is hurting her and to respond in a way that stops the discomfort. The parent emphasizes \"legit violence,\" meaning defensive actions rather than aggressive ones. The child isn't being taught to initiate violence but to protect herself when the other child doesn't stop despite her verbal protests.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the daycare's role. The teachers aren't addressing the issue, which leaves the child vulnerable. The parent is trying to empower the child to take immediate action to ensure her safety and comfort. However, the spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use physical force could escalate the situation or lead to misunderstandings. There's also the risk that the child might overreact or use more force than necessary.\n\nBut considering that the other child's behavior is inappropriate and the child is too young to handle it through more complex communication, teaching her to set physical boundaries might be necessary. The parent is not promoting aggression but teaching self-defense in a specific context where the child is being physically overpowered. The key point is that the parent is helping the child understand that it's okay to protect herself when others don't respect her verbal \"no.\"\n\nHowever, there's a potential downside. At four years old, children are still learning how to manage their impulses and reactions. Even if the parent's advice is well-intentioned, the child might not have the emotional maturity to assess the situation correctly each time. The spouse's argument that non-violent solutions should be prioritized is important because it reinforces the idea that physical retaliation isn't the default response.\n\nBut given the circumstances where the other child isn't respecting the daughter's discomfort and the adults aren't intervening, the parent's approach seems to be a necessary step to ensure the daughter's safety. The parent is teaching the child to recognize her right to personal space and to act in her own defense when verbal methods fail. This can be seen as a form of self-advocacy rather than violence, as it's about setting boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns from the spouse about potential escalation, the parent's approach is aimed at protecting their child in a situation where other methods aren't working. The parent isn't encouraging general violence but teaching age-appropriate self-defense. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong here.\n"
