Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's being too aggressive with hugs and kisses. The parent and their spouse are in a disagreement over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is a same-age peer who's hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that makes her uncomfortable. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is teaching the daughter to use force if needed to protect herself. The spouse argues that the daughter should just tell the teachers and avoid violence altogether.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, the teachers aren't effectively addressing it, and the parent is teaching the child to use force in self-defense. The question is whether teaching a child to push back is appropriate.\n\nI should consider child development. At 4 years old, children are still learning boundaries and how to handle social situations. The parent is trying to empower the child to set her own boundaries, which is a good thing. However, teaching a child to use physical force might have downsides. It could escalate situations, lead to more conflict, or make the child feel aggressive. But on the other hand, the parent is emphasizing that it's okay to defend oneself when someone won't stop despite being told to stop.\n\nAnother angle: the child is being taught to recognize when they're being hurt and to take action. The parent differentiates between \"legit violence\" in self-defense and general violence. The spouse is concerned about promoting any kind of violence, even self-defense. \n\nI should also think about the daycare's role. The teachers aren't seeing the behavior, so maybe the parent should involve the daycare more effectively. But the parent might feel that the daycare isn't doing enough, hence the need for the child to protect herself.\n\nPossible issues with the parent's approach: the child might not understand the boundaries of when it's okay to push. Also, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to distinguish between different levels of force. Additionally, the child's warning about the other kid pushing back is addressed by the parent telling her to push back or run. That could lead to a cycle of retaliation.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to help the child advocate for herself and stay safe. The spouse's approach prioritizes non-violence, which is also valid. The parent might be right in teaching self-advocacy but perhaps overestimating the child's ability to handle the situation physically.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, teaching children to stand up for themselves is often encouraged, but physical intervention in such situations might not be the best solution. Alternative strategies could include role-playing with the child how to say \"no\" firmly, or working with the daycare to find a solution. \n\nThe parent is trying to balance the child's safety with teaching conflict resolution. The spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. Both have valid points. The parent's advice is practical but could have unintended consequences. The spouse's approach emphasizes non-violent conflict resolution, which is important for social development.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to protect their child, which is a good intention. However, advising a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best method. There could be more appropriate ways to handle the situation without promoting violence. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid concerns.\n"
