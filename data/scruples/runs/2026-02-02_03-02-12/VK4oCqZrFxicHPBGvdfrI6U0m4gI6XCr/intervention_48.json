Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too rough, even suggesting pushing back or running away if the other kid retaliates. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong, insisting that non-violence is always better and teachers should be told instead. The parent argues they're teaching the child to use \"legit force\" in a violent situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids have limited ability to understand complex social rules. The daycare setting is a responsibility of the staff, so maybe the parent should focus on ensuring the daycare addresses it more effectively. However, the daughter has already reported it, and the staff isn't seeing it. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut teaching a 4-year-old to push another kid might escalate the situation. Young kids don't distinguish well between appropriate and excessive force. If the daughter pushes back, it could lead to physical altercations that she can't handle. Also, the daycare might have protocols in place, so relying on the child to handle it might not be the best approach. The spouse's point about reporting to teachers is standard child safety advice, emphasizing communication over confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted contact, which is a valid concern. The parent is teaching the child to recognize boundaries and take action if necessary. However, the method might be problematic because it's introducing the idea of using force, which for a 4-year-old might not be the safest approach. There's a line between self-defense and encouraging aggression.\n\nThe daycare's role is crucial here. If the parents have already raised the issue and the daycare isn't addressing it, maybe they should consider changing daycares or getting more involved with the staff. The parent's approach might be a temporary solution while seeking a more systemic fix.\n\nIn terms of child psychology, teaching a child to use physical resistance might not be the best strategy. At that age, kids learn through guidance and clear boundaries. The parent could be modeling effective communication strategies instead of physical ones. For instance, teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly and to seek help from an adult as quickly as possible.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about promoting non-violence, which is a good principle. However, the parent's argument that it's about self-defense in a violent situation is a counterpoint. But again, the definition of \"violent\" here is a hugging/kissing that's uncomfortable but not necessarily aggressive. The line is blurry.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's approach might be well-intentioned but possibly misguided. The best course of action would involve reinforcing communication with the daycare, ensuring they take the issue more seriously, and teaching the child to seek adult help immediately. Encouraging physical resistance could lead to unintended consequences, like the child using force inappropriately or escalating conflicts. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong here, but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
