Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push another child away is at fault. The situation involves a daycare kid who's hugging and kissing the girl violently, even when she yells. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid is being violent and won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinks she should just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are learning boundaries and how to handle social situations. The parent is teaching their daughter to stand up for herself, which might be seen as empowering. But the spouse is concerned about promoting violence. \n\nThe key points here are the nature of the other child's actions\u2014forceful hugs, kisses, not stopping when told. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent's advice is to use force if the child feels threatened. However, the spouse argues against any form of violence.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, teaching a child to use physical force at that age might lead to escalation. But the parent is emphasizing defense against unwelcome contact. It's a balance between self-defense and promoting non-violence. \n\nAlso, the daughter is already aware of the problem and has reported it, but the teachers aren't helping. The parent's solution is a last resort. However, encouraging a 4-year-old to push someone could be seen as teaching aggression, even if it's in self-defense. \n\nBut the parent clarifies they aren't promoting general violence, just in cases where the other child is being violent. The parent is trying to protect their child from ongoing harassment. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's a line between teaching self-defense and inciting violence. Since the other child's actions are aggressive and the teachers aren't addressing it, the parent might feel justified. However, the appropriate age-appropriate response might be to teach the child to seek help immediately, not to push back. \n\nIn many child-rearing philosophies, teaching children to use physical force to resolve conflicts isn't recommended, especially for young children. It could lead to more aggressive behavior. So the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical confrontation instead of seeking adult help. \n\nBut the parent's intention was to protect their child from ongoing harm. It's a tricky situation. The spouse's approach is more about non-violence, which is also valid. \n\nSo, considering all angles, maybe the parent is in the wrong for encouraging physical pushing as a solution for a 4-year-old. The better approach would be reinforcing to tell a teacher immediately and not to retaliate. Even if the other child is being aggressive, teaching a young child to push back might not be the best method. Hence, the answer might be A (the parent is at fault), but there's nuance here.\n"
