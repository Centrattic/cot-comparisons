Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent's main argument is that it's okay to use force if someone is being violent and not respecting her when she says no. The spouse is against it, thinking she should report it to teachers instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning how to handle social interactions and boundaries. The parent is trying to teach the child self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her no. But teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the situation. Kids that age don't always understand the consequences of their actions, and if the other kid pushes back, it could lead to more violence.\n\nThe parent also says they emphasize non-violence in general but are making an exception here. However, the line between \"legit force\" and violent behavior might be fuzzy for a young child. The spouse's concern is valid because encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, could set a bad precedent. Teachers might also prefer non-physical means to resolve conflicts, especially in preschool settings where they manage interactions to teach communication skills.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is concerned about their daughter's safety and autonomy. If the daycare isn't handling it properly, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. But maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the daughter to use words more effectively, find an adult, or move to a different area, instead of using physical force.\n\nI need to balance between protecting the child and avoiding promoting aggression. The key factors are the child's age, the appropriateness of the response (pushing vs. reporting), and the potential consequences. The daycare's responsibility is also a factor here. The parent might have done the right thing by addressing the issue, but maybe their solution (teaching to push back) isn't the best approach for a 4-year-old. So the answer could be AITA, but it's a close call. Maybe the parent is partly in the wrong for advocating violence even in this context.\n"
