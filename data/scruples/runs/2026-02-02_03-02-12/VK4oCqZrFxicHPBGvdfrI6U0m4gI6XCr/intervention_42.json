Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and even kissing her without consent. The parent is being criticized by their spouse for encouraging the child to use violence instead of reporting it to the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is engaging in behavior that's making their daughter uncomfortable, even after she's told the kid to stop and even told the teachers. The parent is advising the child to push back if the other kid doesn't stop, which is a form of self-defense. But the spouse thinks the child should only report it and not use any force.\n\nAt 4 years old, children are learning about personal boundaries and how to handle conflict. The parent's approach is about teaching the child to protect herself in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her no. However, using physical force, even to push away, might escalate the situation. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching non-violence is important, especially for young kids. But the parent is also right in that it's important for a child to know when to stand up for themselves.\n\nI should think about developmental appropriateness. A 4-year-old might not have the social skills to handle this with words alone if the other child isn't responsive. Pushing might be their instinct. However, the parent could have also taught other strategies, like walking away or getting an adult involved immediately after. The key here is whether the parent was encouraging violence or teaching self-defense. The parent says they emphasize that using force is only when there's legitimate violence, so they're not promoting random aggression.\n\nAnother angle: The child's safety and emotional well-being. If the other child is indeed violating her personal space and not respecting her boundaries, the parent's advice is about protecting her from ongoing discomfort or potential trauma. The spouse's approach relies on adults to intervene, but if the teachers aren't effective, the child needs tools to manage the situation herself.\n\nBut there's also the risk that teaching a child to push might lead to physical altercations that could have been prevented with other methods. The parent's solution might be a middle ground\u2014using force only when necessary and otherwise reporting. It's a balance between self-defense and non-violence.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong because they're addressing the immediate issue of their child's discomfort and safety. However, there's room for improvement by teaching additional strategies, like walking away or seeking help, alongside the physical response. The spouse's concern about avoiding violence is valid, but the parent's approach is also a necessary part of teaching self-advocacy. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
