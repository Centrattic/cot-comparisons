Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too hard and kissed by another kid at daycare. The parent told her it's okay to push the other kid away if it's uncomfortable. The spouse argues that she should rely on teachers instead of using force.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries. If another child is being too rough, it's a form of unwanted physical contact. The daycare teachers aren't catching it, so the parent wants the daughter to protect herself. But teaching a young child to use force might be tricky. However, the parent isn't endorsing violence, just using force to stop immediate harm. \n\nThe parent's reasoning is that if someone is hurting her and won't stop, pushing back is a legitimate response. They also mention teaching her to run and tell an adult. The spouse is worried about encouraging violence, but the parent differentiates between self-defense and unprovoked aggression.\n\nLegally and ethically, self-defense is a concept that even children can understand in simple terms. If a child is experiencing force that's causing discomfort or harm, reacting to stop it is a form of self-defense. However, the method of response matters. Pushing back could escalate things, but the parent is teaching the child to protect herself when adults aren't around.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how to handle it through proper channels. The teachers should be involved, and maybe the parent should have discussed with the daycare more about the situation. However, the parent did mention that the teachers aren't seeing it happen, so the child might not feel safe to report each time. \n\nIn child development, teaching a 4-year-old to recognize boundaries is important. The parent is empowering her to stand up for herself, which can be good. But the spouse is concerned about the message it sends about using violence. It's a balance between self-advocacy and non-violence.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong here. They're teaching the child to protect herself when necessary, not to initiate violence. The key is the context of forced contact and the child's right to say no. The parent also advises telling an adult, which covers the non-violent approach. So the answer is B.\n"
