Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her violently is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: the daughter is being hugged very forcefully and even kissed by another kid in daycare. The child has already told the daycare teachers, but the behavior persists. The parent advised their daughter that it's okay to push back if the other kid is hurting her and not stopping when told. The spouse disagrees, thinking that non-violence is better and that the teachers should be informed instead. The daughter is 4 years old, so very young.\n\nI need to consider child development here. At 4, children are still learning how to handle social situations and assert themselves. The other child's behavior is described as violent and non-consensual, even when the daughter objects. The parent's approach is to teach self-defense in a situation where the child is being harmed. However, the spouse is concerned that teaching a child to use violence could lead to more aggressive behavior or escalate conflicts.\n\nBut in this case, the parent is not advocating for general violence; they're responding to a specific situation where the child is being hurt. The parent is teaching their daughter to protect herself when other methods (telling the teachers) haven't worked. It's a form of self-defense, which is different from initiating violence. The parent also mentioned the importance of recognizing the difference between self-defense and violence, so they're not promoting aggression.\n\nHowever, there's a risk that a 4-year-old might not fully understand the nuance of when to push back versus when to just walk away. They might use that as an excuse to hit others even in non-violent situations. Plus, daycare staff are responsible for managing interactions between children, and if the problem persists, maybe there's a need for intervention beyond what the child can handle. The parent's advice could be seen as bypassing the authority figures (teachers) who are supposed to handle such issues.\n\nBut the parent's argument is that the current methods aren't effective. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. So the parent is trying an alternative approach because the existing measures aren't working. They also emphasize that the daughter should only push back when she's being hurt and not stop when asked. That seems like a reasonable way to teach self-advocacy.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid, but in this specific case, the parent might be trying to empower the daughter to protect herself when other avenues have failed. The parent isn't teaching general violence but a specific response to a violent situation. The answer hinges on whether the parent is justified in teaching self-defense in this context or if they're encouraging violence.\n\nConsidering all that, the parent might not be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. The main issue is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. However, given that the child is experiencing consistent unwanted physical contact and the current solutions aren't working, the parent's advice could be seen as a necessary step to protect the child's well-being.\n"
