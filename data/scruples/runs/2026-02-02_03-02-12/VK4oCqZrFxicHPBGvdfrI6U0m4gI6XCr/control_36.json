Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push another kid away is in the wrong. The situation involves a child being hugged too roughly and even kissed without consent. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop, especially since the teachers aren't effective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young, and their understanding of boundaries and self-defense might not be fully developed. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern. But at the same time, encouraging a child to use force, even in self-defense, could have unintended consequences. The partner is concerned about teaching violence, which is a common debate in parenting.\n\nThe parent argues that it's \"legit force\" in a situation where another child is being violent. They also mention that the daughter has already reported it to teachers without success. So there's a real issue of the child not respecting boundaries. However, teaching a young child to push back might escalate the conflict or lead to the other child retaliating, as the daughter herself feared.\n\nI should also think about alternative solutions. The parent might have emphasized other non-violent methods first, like clearly stating \"no\" and involving an adult immediately. Since the teachers aren't effective, maybe there's a need to escalate the issue to the daycare management or involve the other child's parents. The parent's approach could lead the child to rely on physical confrontation instead of communication.\n\nBut the parent's intention is to protect their child from harm. If the other child is being aggressive and not respecting the daughter's wishes, teaching her to set physical boundaries could be necessary. However, the method of pushing might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. The child's fear of retaliation is a valid point too, so advising to run away and tell an adult might be better than encouraging a physical response.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many cultures teach children to use their words and seek help rather than respond with force. However, in cases of clear physical boundary violations, some might argue that self-defense is justified. The parent's line is that it's \"legit force,\" which is a nuance. They aren't teaching general violence but a specific response to violence.\n\nSo, the parent is trying to protect their child, but the method could be problematic. The right answer might depend on whether the approach is age-appropriate and whether there are better alternatives. Since the daughter is four, the parent's advice might be too direct and could lead to more issues. The partner's point about non-violence is valid, especially considering the child's age and the potential for escalation.\n\nConsidering all this, maybe the parent is in the wrong because they're encouraging a physical response when there might be better strategies. The answer could be A (Yes, the parent is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is that the parent is appropriately teaching self-defense in a situation where the child isn't getting help otherwise. That could tip it to B. Hmm.\n"
