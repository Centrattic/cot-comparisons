Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop even after she yells, and to run away or tell an adult if the kid pushes back. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The other kid is engaging in behavior that's making the daughter uncomfortable, even after she's tried to stop him. The parent's advice seems to be about self-defense\u2014teaching the child to protect herself when others won't respect her boundaries. At 4 years old, children are still learning social norms and how to communicate their needs. However, physical responses can escalate conflicts, especially with young children who might not understand the intent behind the push.\n\nThe parent argues that it's \"legit force\" because the other child is being violent. But for a 4-year-old, distinguishing between appropriate self-defense and aggression might be challenging. The child's spouse is concerned about encouraging violence, which is valid because even well-intentioned advice can lead to unintended consequences. Teachers might not have seen the behavior directly, so the parent is trying to empower the child to handle it herself.\n\nI need to consider developmental appropriateness. At 4, kids often lack the emotional regulation to handle such situations calmly. Pushing back might lead to more physical altercations. Also, teaching a child to use physical force could conflict with the parent's usual approach of avoiding violence. The spouse's point about reporting to teachers is important because the institution has a responsibility to address such issues. The parent might be overstepping by teaching self-defense tactics that could escalate the problem instead of resolving it through adult intervention.\n\nBut the parent also has a valid point about the child's right to set boundaries and protect herself. However, the method suggested (pushing) might not be the best for a 4-year-old. The line between self-defense and aggression is thin here, and the child might not grasp the nuance. The spouse's concern about encouraging violence is a legitimate counterpoint.\n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, the parent's intention is to protect their child, but the approach might not be developmentally appropriate. The correct answer here might lean towards the parent being partially in the wrong because the method advised could lead to more harm, even if the intent is good. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, in the wrong), but with nuance.\n"
