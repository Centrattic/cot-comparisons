Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is being hugged and kissed by another kid in daycare in a way that's uncomfortable. She's told the teachers, but they don't see it happening, and the other kid doesn't stop. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push him away if he's being too forceful, especially if he doesn't stop when she yells. The parent also said if the other kid pushes back, she should push back again or run to an adult. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to just tell a teacher, not use violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are about age-appropriate responses to unwanted physical contact, teaching self-defense, and whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old.\n\nAt 4, kids have limited understanding of consent and personal boundaries. The other child's actions are aggressive and non-consensual. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself when adults aren't around. But using physical force might escalate the situation. However, the parent is not advocating for violence but for self-defense in a situation where the other child is being violent.\n\nI think the parent's intention is good. They want their daughter to feel empowered to set boundaries. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push back could be risky, especially since the child might not know how to de-escalate or use appropriate force. Also, in daycare settings, there are policies about how to handle such situations, so maybe the parent should involve the daycare more or discuss with the teacher to ensure they address the behavior. \n\nBut the parent's advice isn't about hitting or hurting; it's about pushing away in a moment of need. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, but the parent is emphasizing self-defense. It's a balance between teaching the child to protect herself and ensuring she doesn't get into more trouble. \n\nI think the parent isn't entirely wrong because they're addressing the immediate need for the child to feel safe. However, maybe there are better strategies for a 4-year-old, like verbal assertiveness with supervision. So the parent might have valid reasoning, but perhaps the approach isn't the best. Still, in the absence of adult intervention, teaching self-protection is a reasonable step. The answer might be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
