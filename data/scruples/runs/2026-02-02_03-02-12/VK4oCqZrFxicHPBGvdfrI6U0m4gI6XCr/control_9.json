Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging/kissing her too roughly. The kid in question isn't stopping even when the daughter yells, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is using force and not respecting a child's \"no,\" then it's okay to push back. The other parent (SO) disagrees, saying it's better to rely on teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child safety and boundaries. The daughter is clearly uncomfortable and the other child's behavior is aggressive. At 4 years old, children are still learning social skills and how to handle conflict. The parent is teaching self-defense, which could be seen as necessary to protect the child. But using physical force against another child, even in self-defense, might teach the child that violence is an acceptable response. However, in this case, the parent is differentiating between \"legit violence\" (defending oneself) and unprovoked aggression.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO's concern is valid too. Encouraging a child to use physical force might escalate the situation. The daycare's role is to manage such interactions, and the parent might be overstepping if they're not following the daycare's protocols. Also, at 4, kids might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate, even with guidance.\n\nBut the key here is the child's well-being. If the daycare isn't addressing the issue, the parent has a responsibility to protect their child. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where another child is being violent and not respecting boundaries. The parent isn't advocating for general aggression but a specific response to immediate harm. The daughter was already instructed to tell the teachers, but that hasn't worked. So, the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself when adults aren't intervening.\n\nI think the parent is trying to balance teaching the child to assert her boundaries without encouraging violence. However, there's a risk that the child might misinterpret the advice or use it inappropriately. The parent should also reinforce reporting the incident to adults as part of the solution. But given the circumstances, the parent's intent is protective, which is a parent's primary duty. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's a middle ground where teaching non-violent ways to set boundaries could be better. However, given the context, the parent's advice is reasonable. Answer B.\n"
