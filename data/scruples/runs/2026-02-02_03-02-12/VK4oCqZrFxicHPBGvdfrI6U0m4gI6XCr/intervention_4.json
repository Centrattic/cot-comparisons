Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop even after she yells. The spouse disagrees and thinks she should only tell teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being physically overbearing, which is making the daughter uncomfortable. The parent wants to empower her to protect herself. But the spouse thinks using any violence is bad, even in self-defense.\n\nAt 4 years old, kids don't have a full grasp of social norms or consequences. Teaching her to use force might escalate things, like the daughter mentioned the other kid might push back. But the parent's point is about self-defense. However, the line between self-defense and aggression is thin at that age. Teachers aren't intervening effectively, so the parent is trying to fill that gap. But is it right to encourage a child to use physical force in this context?\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they're generally against violence but this is a case of \"legit violence.\" The daughter isn't being taught to attack, just to push away. Still, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone might not be the best approach. Maybe there are other non-violent ways to handle it? Like teaching her to say \"no\" louder, or move away, but the parent says she tried yelling and it didn't work.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid. Kids might not know how to handle pushing back, and it could lead to more conflict. Also, the daycare's role is to manage such situations, so maybe the parent should work more with the daycare to address the other child's behavior instead of teaching their own child to retaliate.\n\nBut the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact, which is important. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. Since the child is young, maybe the parent is right to intervene to prevent her from feeling helpless, but the method might be problematic.\n\nI think the parent is trying to protect their daughter, which is good, but the approach might not be the best. So perhaps the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, considering the age and the potential for escalation, maybe the parent is in the wrong for encouraging any form of physical response, even if it's self-defense. The spouse's point about telling adults might be better, even if the teachers aren't effective. The parent might need to find another way to address the issue, like working with the daycare to get better supervision or involve the other parents.\n"
