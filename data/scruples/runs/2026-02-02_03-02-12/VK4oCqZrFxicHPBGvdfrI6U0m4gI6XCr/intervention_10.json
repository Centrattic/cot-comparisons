Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in an uncomfortable way.\n\nFirst, the situation: The other kid is being forceful, not respecting the daughter's discomfort even after she tells him to stop. The teachers aren't effective because they don't catch it. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid is being violent. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should only report it to teachers.\n\nSo, the key points here are about teaching a child to use self-defense versus avoiding violence. The parent is emphasizing that if someone is hurting her and not stopping, pushing back is acceptable. The argument is about whether this is appropriate for a 4-year-old.\n\nI need to consider child development. At 4 years old, kids are learning boundaries and how to express their feelings. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in a situation where adults aren't intervening. However, some might argue that even gentle pushing could escalate into a conflict, and that the child should rely on adults. But others might say that teaching self-defense in such a context is important for safety.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of how the parent communicated it. They didn't encourage random violence, just in cases where the other child is being aggressive. The daughter even asked about potential retaliation, and the parent advised pushing back again or running away. That seems like a reasonable self-defense strategy.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid\u2014teaching non-violence is important. But in cases of assault, even by another child, self-defense is generally supported. The parent is trying to balance teaching respect for others' boundaries while also teaching their own child to protect herself.\n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because the situation involves unwanted physical contact that the child is trying to avoid, and the parent is giving practical advice when adults aren't effective. The spouse's approach is also valid, but the parent's advice is about immediate self-protection, which is a reasonable approach.\n"
