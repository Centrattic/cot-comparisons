Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent and their significant other (SO) had a disagreement over this. The parent argues that it's okay to use \"legit force\" when someone is hurting their child and not stopping, while the SO thinks they should rely on telling teachers instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child development. A 4-year-old is still learning social skills and how to handle conflicts. Teaching them to use physical force could be problematic because they might not fully understand boundaries or consequences. Even if the other child is being overly affectionate, the appropriate response for a young child is usually to seek help from an adult rather than escalating the situation with physical actions.\n\nNext, the daycare's role. The parent mentions that the teachers have been notified but haven't been effective. However, the daycare might need more specific strategies or interventions. Teaching the child to push back could lead to retaliation, creating a cycle of conflict. It's possible the daycare isn't aware of the full extent of the issue or how to handle it when it happens quickly.\n\nAlso, the parent's reasoning about \"legit violence\" versus teaching non-violence is a point to consider. While the intention is to protect the child, using physical means at such a young age might not be the best approach. The child might not understand the difference between appropriate self-defense and just aggression, leading to potential issues in social interactions.\n\nThe SO's perspective emphasizes non-violence, which is a common parenting approach, especially with young children. It's important to model and teach conflict resolution without physicality. Encouraging the child to report incidents and seek help reinforces communication and trust in adults, which is crucial for safety.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. If the other child pushes back, the situation becomes more dangerous. The parent's advice includes running away, which is good, but pushing might not be the safest initial response for a 4-year-old. Their ability to assess and respond appropriately in the moment could be limited.\n\nIn terms of child safety, the parent's concern is valid. The child's well-being is paramount, and if the daycare isn't managing the situation effectively, the parent should explore other options, like switching daycares or involving child protective services if necessary. However, advising the child to use physical force might not be the right solution.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method suggested could be inappropriate for a 4-year-old's developmental stage and social skills. Encouraging non-violent communication and relying on adult intervention is generally more effective and safer. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for endorsing physical responses.\n"
