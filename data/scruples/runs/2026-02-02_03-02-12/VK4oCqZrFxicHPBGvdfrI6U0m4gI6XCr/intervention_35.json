Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The kid in question isn't stopping even when told, and teachers haven't intervened effectively.\n\nFirst, the parent is teaching their child to assert themselves in a situation where they feel uncomfortable. The key here is that the other child's actions are non-consensual and potentially harmful. The parent is emphasizing setting boundaries and using physical force as a last resort if verbal warnings don't work. They also mention teaching the child to defend themselves if pushed back and to seek adult help.\n\nThe spouse argues against using any violence, preferring to rely on teachers. But the problem is the teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior. The parent's approach is about safety and self-advocacy, which is important for children to learn. At 4 years old, it's reasonable to teach them to recognize when something is uncomfortable and how to respond, especially if adults aren't helping. \n\nHowever, there's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting violent behavior. The parent is clear that the force should be necessary and not excessive, like pushing back but not beating up. Given the context of forced physical contact that's unwanted, teaching the child to protect herself makes sense. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. They're prioritizing the child's well-being and ability to handle unsafe situations.\n"
