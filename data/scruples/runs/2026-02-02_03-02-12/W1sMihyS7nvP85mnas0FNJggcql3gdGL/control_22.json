He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that six years ago, the author's friend started a company and asked the author to design the website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement where the author was supposed to get $2,000 plus a 5% stake. The author worked on it for two weeks, then six more weeks for tweaks. The friend hired another designer for the frontend, who got paid up front. After the author finished, the friend ghosted, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the friend's business to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many places isn't as strong as a written contract. But some verbal agreements can be legally binding, especially if there's evidence of performance. The author did the work, but didn't get paid. However, the friend has been using the author's code and systems without payment, which might be a breach of contract. But the author's idea to \"fuck his shit over\" by messing with the systems could be illegal, like hacking or destroying property.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if the friend was wrong to not pay, does the author have the right to retaliate in a way that could harm the business? Maybe there's a better way to seek compensation, like legal action. The author mentions they still have access to the domain and hosting, which they might have a claim to. But taking down the website or the POS system could cause harm beyond just seeking payment. It might affect customers and employees, which could make the author's actions unethical.\n\nAlso, the author's approach seems to be driven by anger and a desire for revenge, not just compensation. The question is whether that's justified. Even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's method of getting what they think they're owed is problematic. Legal recourse is usually the proper way, but resorting to sabotage is illegal and could lead to criminal charges or civil liability.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author might have a case for seeking the money they were promised, but their method of doing so by disrupting the business is wrong. The verbal agreement could be tricky in court, but that's a separate issue from the legality of the author's actions now. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage the business.\n"
