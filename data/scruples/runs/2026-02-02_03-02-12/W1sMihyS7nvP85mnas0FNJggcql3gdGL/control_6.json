He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author of this \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement where the friend would pay $2000 plus a 5% stake. The author worked on it for a couple of months, then was ghosted. The friend became successful, owns multiple stores and houses, and the author has stewed in anger. Now, they're considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake, and the question is whether that makes them wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many places isn't as enforceable as a written contract. But some verbal agreements can be legally binding if there's consideration and an offer. However, the author might not have a legal leg to stand on here if there's no proof. The fact that the friend didn't pay and cut off communication complicates things. Even if the author is right about the agreement, taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" (like maybe removing access or sabotaging systems) could be illegal. That's sabotage, which is a criminal offense. Also, the author still has access to the domain and hosting, which they might have the legal right to, but using that to disrupt the business could lead to legal trouble.\n\nOn the ethical side, the author might feel wronged because they put in work expecting compensation. However, the friend might have had reasons for not paying, maybe the business failed at first, or there was a misunderstanding. The author could have tried legal action, like small claims court, but instead chose to hold a grudge and now retaliate. Ethically, sabotage is wrong regardless of the provocation. Even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's response is harmful and could be considered morally wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has retired and is doing well now, so maybe the company is stable. Disrupting it could hurt employees or customers, which adds another layer of ethical concern. Retaliation for past grievances without legal recourse is generally frowned upon. The author could be seen as taking justice into their own hands, which isn't a good precedent.\n\nBut wait, the author did complete the work and there was an agreement. If the friend agreed to a stake and payment, and didn't deliver, that's a breach of contract. However, without written proof, enforcing that in court might be difficult. So legally, the author might not have a case, but ethically, the friend was wrong. However, the author's response is still not appropriate. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their actions are illegal and unethical, even if the friend was at fault in not paying. Retaliation isn't justified.\n\nAnother angle: the author could have tried to resolve this through legal channels. If they didn't, and now are planning to disrupt the business, that's not the right approach. The friend might not have intended the verbal agreement as binding, or might have forgotten, but the author's plan to sabotage would be wrong regardless. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
