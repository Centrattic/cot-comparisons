He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and a stake in a company. The friend ghosted after the work was done, and now the author is considering taking action.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: Verbal agreements can be tough in court. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The author has the domain and hosting under their name, which might give them some legal standing regarding the website and POS system. However, using a competitor's domain for a website would be illegal, but here it's their own domain. The code usage could be an issue if the author retains ownership. But if the code is still in use, there might be a case for compensation or damages.\n\nEthically, the friend broke a promise, which is a betrayal. The author worked hard and was ghosted, leading to loss of friendship and unpaid work. The friend's current success built on the author's work adds to the ethical dilemma. The author's anger is justified, but taking destructive action might not be the right approach. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action.\n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The author's intent is revenge, which is morally questionable, but the initial agreement breach is on the friend. Legally, the author might have a case, but the friend's actions are the main issue. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking justice, but the method (disrupting the company) is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering it. Considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the friend's actions were unethical and the author has a valid claim.\n"
