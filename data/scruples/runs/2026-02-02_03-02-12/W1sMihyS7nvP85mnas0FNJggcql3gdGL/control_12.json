He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering messing up the friend's systems because of the unpaid work and lost friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court. Depending on the jurisdiction, some types of contracts (like those involving real estate) require written agreements, but for services, verbal can sometimes be valid. However, proving the terms of a verbal agreement can be difficult without evidence. The author might not have a legal claim here because there's no written contract, and the friend isn't acknowledging the debt.\n\nEthically, the friend clearly didn't follow through on the agreement, which is wrong. But the author's response of wanting to \"fuck his shit over\" is also problematic. Retaliation by damaging someone's business, even if they're at fault, is unethical and could be illegal. The author could have other recourse, like sending a demand letter, trying to negotiate, or even legal action if possible. But taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company's systems would be illegal, regardless of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting, which they might be using as leverage. However, misusing access to someone else's systems, even if they owe money, is a criminal act. It's not about whether they're right or wrong in the dispute, but about the legality of their actions.\n\nThe author's plan to disrupt the company is not justified. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's response would make them legally and ethically wrong. The correct approach would be to seek legal remedies, not take revenge. So, while the friend is definitely at fault for breaking the agreement, the author would be in the wrong for taking illegal and unethical actions.\n"
