He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement with a $2000 payment and a 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, did the backend, and the designer was paid upfront but didn't get a stake. The friend then ghosted them after the project, ignoring all communication. Now, the company is a multi-million-dollar success, and the author is considering disrupting it because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. If there's no written contract, enforcing the 5% stake and $2000 payment might be difficult. The author mentions owning the domain and webhost, which are in their name. If the code is still their property, they might have a legal claim to the POS system's usage. However, without a contract, it's uncertain. The friend might have assumed the author was working under a different arrangement, like a standard service agreement without equity.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author worked hard, invested time, and followed through, but the friend didn't honor the agreement. The emotional impact of losing a friend is significant here. The author's desire for retribution is understandable, but disrupting the friend's company could lead to legal consequences. Even if the author has rights to some assets, taking action unilaterally might be seen as unethical or even illegal, especially if it harms the company's operations.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions of ghosting and not communicating could be considered a breach of trust. The author might feel entitled to the payment and stake, but the friend's lack of response doesn't necessarily make the author right to take matters into their own hands. The appropriate course of action would be to seek legal advice first. Maybe the friend is in default, but the author should pursue legal channels rather than causing disruption.\n\nIf the author does have ownership of the domain, webhost, and code, they could potentially seek compensation through legal means. However, if the friend can prove that the work was done under a different agreement, the author might not have a strong case. The key here is the enforceability of the verbal agreement and the ownership of the assets.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author's anger is justified, but the method of seeking justice (disrupting the company) could be problematic. Ethically, it's important to address grievances through proper channels. Taking down the website or sabotaging the POS system might be seen as revenge rather than rightful compensation. The author could be in the wrong if their actions are illegal or unethical, even if the friend breached the verbal agreement.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions are legally and ethically justified. The friend's failure to pay and the existence of a verbal agreement might not be enough to make the author right to take aggressive action. The author might have a case, but they need to handle it through legal means, not by causing intentional harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong if they take disruptive actions, as that could lead to their own legal issues.\n"
