He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a friend who started a company six years ago. The author helped design the website and POS system under a verbal agreement. The agreement included $2000 and a 5% stake. The friend later ghosted the author, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the friend's company because they feel owed money and recognition.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult, especially if there's no evidence. The author might have a case for breach of contract, but enforcing it could be challenging. However, the author still has access to the domain and hosting, which they haven't given up. If the code is still being used, that might be a point in their favor, but again, depends on the original agreement about intellectual property rights.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is definitely wrong. However, retaliating by disrupting the company could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's planned actions could cause harm beyond just seeking compensation. The author might be justified in seeking what's owed, but using destructive methods could escalate the situation negatively. Also, the author had access to the systems and didn't act sooner, which might affect the perception of their actions now.\n\nAnother angle: the author's emotional response. They were hurt by the ghosting and the loss of friendship. But using the current access to sabotage the company could be considered harmful and unethical, regardless of the prior wrong. There's a difference between seeking payment through legal means and actively harming someone else's business.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend is retired and the company is successful. If the author is considering disrupting operations, that could affect employees and customers, which adds another layer of ethical consideration. It's not just about the friend's wealth but the broader impact.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were definitely wrong, the author's potential retaliation might cross ethical and legal lines. The author could pursue legal action to claim what's owed, but taking matters into their own hands by sabotaging the business is not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions despite the initial betrayal.\n"
