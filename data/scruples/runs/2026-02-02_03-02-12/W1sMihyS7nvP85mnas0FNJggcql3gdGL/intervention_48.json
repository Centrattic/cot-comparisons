He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement where the author provided services in exchange for payment and a stake in the company. The friend didn't follow through on the payment or the stake, and now the author is thinking about taking action to get what they believe is rightfully theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but proving them is tough. The author has a claim based on this verbal agreement, but without written evidence, it might be hard to enforce. However, the fact that the author still holds the domain and hosting, and has access to the code, might give them leverage.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author invested significant time and effort into the project, put other projects on hold, and was left unpaid. The friend's company has since become very successful. The author hasn't received any payment or acknowledgment, and the friend seems to have ghosted them. The friend's actions could be seen as unethical, especially with the company's success now.\n\nThe author is considering taking action to disrupt the company's operations. Disrupting a company's systems or data could be illegal, regardless of the situation. Even if there's a legitimate grievance, the method of resolving it through legal means is important. The author might have valid claims but using destructive methods could make them liable legally.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe they're not considering the potential legal repercussions of the action. Even if the author has a case, taking matters into their own hands by damaging the company's systems is not the right approach. The proper course would be to pursue legal action to recover the owed payment and stake, rather than retaliating in a way that could cause harm.\n\nSo, while the friend's actions were unethical and possibly illegal, the author's threat to disrupt the company could also be problematic. The author might have a right to compensation but not the right to sabotage the company. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for considering such a disruptive action, despite the initial grievances.\n"
