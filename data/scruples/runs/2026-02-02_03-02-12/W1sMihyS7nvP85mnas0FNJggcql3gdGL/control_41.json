He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt their \"friend's\" company. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement where the author was supposed to get $2000 and 5% of the company for designing the website and POS system. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them. Now the friend is successful, and the author wants to take action because they feel wronged.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the enforceability of the verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be valid but hard to prove, especially without any written documentation. Since there's no written agreement, the friend could argue that there was no formal contract. The author might have a hard time proving the terms of the agreement in court.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. If the author were to take down the website or disable the POS system, that could be considered sabotage. Depending on the laws in their area, that might be illegal. Even if the author feels wronged, taking such actions without legal recourse could land them in trouble.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship aspect. The friend cut off communication, which is bad, but the author is now considering disrupting the friend's business out of revenge or to get payment. That's a personal vendetta, which isn't a legally acceptable reason for taking action. The author might be justified in feeling they were wronged, but acting on it without legal steps is problematic.\n\nThe author could potentially pursue legal action to claim the $2000 and the 5% stake. They should consult a lawyer to see if they have a case based on the verbal agreement. However, threatening to disrupt the business isn't a legal or ethical way to handle it. Even if they have a point, the method they're considering is not appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author might have a valid claim, but their plan to disrupt the company is likely illegal and unethical. Therefore, they are in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
