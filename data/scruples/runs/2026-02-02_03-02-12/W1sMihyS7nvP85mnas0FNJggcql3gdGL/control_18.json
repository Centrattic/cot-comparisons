He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is considering disrupting their friend's company after not being paid for their work six years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many jurisdictions isn't as enforceable as a written contract, especially for stakes in a company. However, they had a gentleman's agreement. The author did the work, but the friend didn't pay and now the company is successful. The author still holds the domain and hosting, and some code is still in use. \n\nLegally, the author might have a case for breach of contract, but since it's verbal and there's no documentation, proving it could be difficult. The friend might not acknowledge the agreement, and without evidence, the author's legal standing might be weak. Additionally, taking action by disrupting the company could lead to legal repercussions for the author, like theft or sabotage.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The friend ghosted the author and didn't honor the agreement. The author was left without payment or acknowledgment. However, seeking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as unethical, even if the friend was wrong. The author's anger and desire for justice are understandable, but the method of retaliation might cross ethical lines.\n\nThe author has legal recourse, like sending a cease and desist or going to court, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" isn't advisable. The friend's current success might make the author feel wronged, but the best approach is through legal channels. Disruption could harm both parties, especially if the author is seen as acting out of revenge rather than seeking fair compensation.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the bond seems broken, but the author's actions could escalate the conflict. The friend might not have intended to betray the author, but ignoring the agreement and cutting off communication was a mistake. However, the author's response could be seen as equally wrong if it's harmful and not through proper channels.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the right if they proceed with disruptive actions. They should pursue legal options instead. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but they should handle it legally rather than taking revenge. Wait, but the options are A for Yes (author is wrong) and B for No. So if the author is considering disrupting the company, which is illegal and unethical, then the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
