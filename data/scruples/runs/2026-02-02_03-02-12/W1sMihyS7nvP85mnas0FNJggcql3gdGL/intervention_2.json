He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company, hired the author to design a website and POS system with a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, the friend then ghosted them, and now the company is worth millions. The author is considering disrupting the friend's company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. There's a verbal agreement, but verbal contracts can be tricky. Legally, they're binding, but proving the terms might be difficult. The author hasn't received payment, which is a problem. However, using their access to the domain and code to disrupt the company could be illegal, even if there's a breach of contract. Trespassing on someone's digital assets to cause harm might be considered sabotage or theft of trade secrets.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author feels wronged, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" could be seen as revenge, which might not be the right approach. Even if the friend is in the wrong for breaking the agreement, the author's actions could cause harm beyond just money, affecting employees, customers, and the business's reputation.\n\nThe fact that the author still has access to the domain and code might mean they have legal rights over those assets. However, using those rights to disrupt the company could cross a line. It's possible that the author could pursue legal action to claim payment and equity, which would be a more appropriate method.\n\nAlso, the friendship aspect complicates things. The author wanted to maintain the friendship but didn't get a response. Now, after years, the friend seems to have moved on, and the author's anger is justified but needs to be addressed properly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might have a case for unpaid work, but taking direct action to disrupt the company could be illegal. Ethically, revenge isn't the best path. The right approach would be to seek legal recourse to recover the owed money and equity instead of taking destructive actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company instead of handling it through proper channels.\n"
