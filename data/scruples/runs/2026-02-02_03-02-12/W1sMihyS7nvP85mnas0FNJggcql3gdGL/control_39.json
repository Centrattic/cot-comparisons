He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their former friend's company. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author designed a website and POS system for their friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them, leading to years of silence. Now the company is worth millions, and the author is considering taking action to disrupt it because they feel wronged.\n\nSo, the main points here are the verbal agreement, lack of payment, and the current situation where the friend is successful. The author hasn't been paid and still has access to the domain, hosting, and code. They're considering messing with the company's systems.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, they can be enforceable but might be hard to prove without evidence. Since there's no written contract, the friend might not be legally obligated to pay the 5% stake or the $2000. However, ethically, if they had a mutual understanding, there could be an argument for payment. \n\nThe author is considering taking action, which could involve illegal activities like deleting data or disrupting services. Even if they feel wronged, taking such actions could lead to legal consequences. The friend might have a right to use the code they paid someone else to maintain, especially if there's no contract transferring ownership. The author's access to the domain and hosting in their name could be a point of contention, but using that to disrupt the company could be seen as theft or sabotage.\n\nEthically, the author is justified in feeling betrayed and seeking payment. However, the method of seeking that payment by disrupting the company is likely to be seen as wrong because it's harmful and illegal. The appropriate steps would be to pursue legal action if possible, like sending a demand letter or taking the case to court. Resorting to sabotage would cross a line and make the author legally liable, regardless of their grievances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the friend may have acted unethically, the author's plan to disrupt the company is wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their proposed actions are illegal and unethical, despite the situation.\n"
