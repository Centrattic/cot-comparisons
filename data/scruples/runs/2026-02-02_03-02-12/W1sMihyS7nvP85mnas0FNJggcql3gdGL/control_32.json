He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's successful company over an unpaid debt and equity from six years ago. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was asked to design a website and POS system for a friend's startup. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The work was done, but the friend ghosted them, cutting off contact. Now, the company is multi-million dollar, and the author is contemplating causing disruption because they weren't paid.\n\nSo, the legal aspect: Verbal agreements can be enforceable but are harder to prove. The author might have a case, but without written proof, it's tough. However, the author still holds the domain, hosting, and some code. If they remove access or alter the systems, that could be seen as sabotage, which is illegal regardless of the circumstances.\n\nMoral/ethical angle: The friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is clearly wrong. But does that justify the author taking revenge by disrupting the company? Retaliation, even if perceived as justified, can be seen as unethical. The author has legal avenues, like sending a demand letter or seeking mediation, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" crosses a line.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they aren't paid to release exclusive licenses, so they might have rights to the code. However, using that to disrupt operations could lead to legal consequences for the author, like vandalism or breach of contract claims.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were wrong, the author's potential retaliation is not justified. They should pursue legal remedies rather than taking destructive actions. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of their grievance, but their proposed action is wrong). Wait, but the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt. The answer hinges on whether their actions are justified. Since they're considering illegal or unethical retaliation, they would be in the wrong. Hmm. Need to clarify.\n\nThe original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's plan is to disrupt the company, then yes, that's wrong regardless of the reason. Even if the friend is at fault, the author can't take revenge through sabotage. Therefore, the correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company).\n"
