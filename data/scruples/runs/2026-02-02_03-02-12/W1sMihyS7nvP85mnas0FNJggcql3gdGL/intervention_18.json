He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start his company by designing a website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The friend never paid, ghosted the author, and now the company is successful with multiple stores. The author is considering disrupting the company because of the unpaid debt and lost friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" which the author admits is worth nothing. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but proving them is extremely hard without evidence. Since the friend hasn't acknowledged the agreement, the author might not have legal recourse. So legally, it's a gray area.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author worked on the project, put in a lot of time, and the friend didn't follow through on the payment. The friend also cut off communication beyond minimal contact. On the other hand, the author is considering taking drastic actions now\u2014disrupting the company's operations. That's where the moral question comes in. Is it right to retaliate by causing harm to someone, even if they wronged you? The author might feel wronged, but taking down a company could be seen as excessive.\n\nAlso, the friend's current position: he's retired, owns two houses, has a successful business. The author is still working, and their relationship has deteriorated. The author has access to the domain and hosting, and some code is still in use. If the author deletes or alters these, it could disrupt the business.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the original agreement was valid, the author's response of disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble for the author. The friend might have legal claims against the author for sabotage or breach of contract. Plus, the author's actions could cause significant harm to others, like employees or customers of the business, which raises ethical concerns beyond just their personal dispute.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's non-payment and cutting off ties could be considered a breach of trust and a failure to honor a verbal agreement. However, the author's retaliation might not be justified, regardless of past actions. Ethics often require responding in a way that seeks resolution rather than vengeance. Disrupting the company could be seen as a form of revenge rather than a fair resolution.\n\nAnother angle: the author hasn't tried to resolve this through legal means. If there's a chance of legal action, maybe the author should consult a lawyer instead of taking matters into their own hands. The fact that the code is still in their possession might mean they have the right to use it as leverage, but using that leverage to destroy the company could be crossing a line.\n\nSo putting it all together: legally, the author might not be in the right to disrupt the company, especially if there's no enforceable contract. Ethically, retaliation through sabotage could be considered wrong regardless of the initial wrongdoing. The author might feel justified, but the action of \"fucking his shit over\" is likely not the right course of action. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
