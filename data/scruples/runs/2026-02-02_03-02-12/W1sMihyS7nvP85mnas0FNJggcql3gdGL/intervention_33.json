He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects on hold, and after finishing, was ghosted. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements are generally valid but can be hard to enforce, especially without evidence. The author might have a case if they can prove the agreement existed, but that's tricky. Legally, if there's no written contract, it might be difficult to claim the 5% stake. But maybe the POS system's code is still under the author's ownership, so using that as leverage could be a way to demand payment. However, holding onto someone's company assets to get paid isn't exactly legal, even if you have a right to some compensation.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author helped a friend with a project, expecting payment and equity. The friend didn't pay, which is a breach of the agreement. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they invested time and effort. But the idea of \"fucking his shit over\" is a strong action. Even if the author has a claim, sabotaging the company could be seen as revenge and might cross ethical lines. The question is whether the author's actions are justified morally, regardless of legality.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh the pros and cons. The author's right to payment is questionable without a contract, but holding the domain and hosting under their name gives them some leverage. However, using that leverage in a harmful way might not be the best approach. It's a gray area between legal rights and moral obligations. The friend's actions were definitely wrong in not honoring the agreement, but the author's response could be seen as excessive.\n\nAlso, the friendship aspect is important. The friend didn't just ignore payment but also cut off all contact, which is hurtful. But does that justify sabotage? There's a difference between seeking compensation and causing intentional harm. The author might have other options, like negotiating or, if possible, taking legal action even without a contract. Using the existing access to disrupt the company's operations is risky and could lead to legal trouble for the author as well.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's position is complex. Legally, they might have a weak case, but morally, the friend's non-payment and ghosting is questionable. However, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be seen as wrong because it's harmful and potentially illegal. The right approach would be to pursue legal avenues if possible, rather than taking vengeful actions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if they act out in a destructive manner despite their grievances.\n"
