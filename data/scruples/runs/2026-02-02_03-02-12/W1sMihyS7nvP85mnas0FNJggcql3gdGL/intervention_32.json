He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's successful company. The situation started when the friend asked for help with a website and POS system six years ago. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. But after the work was done, the friend ghosted them, leading to a broken friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. There's a verbal agreement, which in some places might be enforceable, but it's tricky. The author mentions that the company didn't have proper invoicing tools back then, which the friend was responsible for. The author also notes that they have the domain and hosting in their name, and some code is still in use. However, the friend might have made changes, so the code's ownership could be a gray area. \n\nEthically, the friend not honoring the agreement is a problem. The author invested time and resources into building the system, and the friend didn't pay. But the author now has the leverage of owning parts of the website and having access. If they take action, like changing domain info or removing code, it could disrupt the company. But is that justified?\n\nThe author is upset about losing a friend and not being acknowledged. They might feel wronged, but is taking revenge through disrupting the company the right move? Legally, the author might not have a strong case without a written contract. Ethically, it's about whether revenge is appropriate. Even if the friend is in the wrong, sabotaging their business could lead to legal trouble for the author, like breach of contract or theft of services. Plus, it might not resolve the emotional hurt but could cause more damage to their relationship and possibly the author's own reputation.\n\nSo, even though the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, the author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and harmful. There might be better ways to handle this, like seeking legal advice or cutting ties. Therefore, the author is in the wrong to disrupt the company out of spite.\n"
