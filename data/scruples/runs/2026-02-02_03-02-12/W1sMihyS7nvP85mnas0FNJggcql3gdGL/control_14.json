He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author did the work, but then the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering messing up the friend's systems because of the unpaid work.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. There's a verbal agreement, but verbal contracts can be tricky. Legally, they are binding, but proving the terms might be hard. The author did the work, but hasn't been paid. However, the friend isn't responding, so maybe there's a misunderstanding or some other reason. The author is now thinking of disrupting the company's operations. \n\nThe author has access to the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. If they take action, like removing access or deleting code, that could harm the company. But is that justified? The author has a claim on the code since it wasn't transferred. However, retaliating by disrupting the business might be illegal, even if there's a grievance. \n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is wrong. But the author's response of causing damage could be considered revenge, which isn't right either. The author should probably pursue legal action to recover what's owed, rather than taking matters into their own hands. Destroying someone's work or disrupting their business could lead to legal consequences for the author. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions of ghosting and not paying are clearly wrong. The author's anger is understandable, but the method of seeking retribution is problematic. The right approach would be to seek legal advice to claim payment and the stake, maybe through a lawsuit. Intentionally sabotaging the company is likely illegal, regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company, even if the friend broke the agreement. The proper channel would be legal action, not revenge. Also, the author holding onto the domain and hosting isn't necessarily wrong if they still own it, but using that to cause harm is. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong) because their proposed action is not justified and could lead to legal issues.\n"
