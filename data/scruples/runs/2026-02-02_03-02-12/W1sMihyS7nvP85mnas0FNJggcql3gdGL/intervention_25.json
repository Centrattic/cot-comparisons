He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company over an old unpaid agreement. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend started a company six years ago. The author designed the website and POS system under a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The friend ghosted after the work was done, and now the company is successful.\n\nSo, the author is contemplating taking action to disrupt the company because they haven't been paid. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. \n\nLet's break it down. Verbal agreements can be legally binding but are hard to enforce. The friend never paid, and the author still has control over domain and hosting. The author's code is still in use, which might imply some form of unauthorized use. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author might have a case, but proving a verbal agreement could be tough without written evidence. However, the author has not taken legal action yet and is considering something drastic, like sabotaging the company. That's where the moral and ethical aspects come in. \n\nDisrupting someone's business, even if you feel wronged, is generally considered illegal and unethical. It could lead to criminal charges for sabotage. The author might have legal recourse through a lawsuit to claim payment, but resorting to hacking or other disruptive actions crosses a line. \n\nAdditionally, the author's friend has moved on and built a successful business. The author's decision to take matters into their own hands could make them the antagonist. Even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's actions would be unlawful and likely morally questionable. \n\nSo, while the friend's actions were unethical, the author's plan to disrupt the company is likely wrong. The correct approach would be to seek legal remedies, not vigilantism.\n"
