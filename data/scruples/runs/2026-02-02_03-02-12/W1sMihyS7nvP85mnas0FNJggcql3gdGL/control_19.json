He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would I Be Termed A...\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author did the work, but then was ghosted, didn't get paid, and now the friend is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many places isn't as enforceable as a written contract. The author did the work, but since there's no written proof, it's hard to claim legally. The friend might argue there was no formal agreement. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which could be leverage, but taking action like removing access could be illegal, maybe even sabotage.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is a breach of trust. The author was ghosted and not paid, which is unfair. However, the author is considering retaliating by damaging the company, which is definitely wrong. Even if the friend is at fault, the author's actions would be unethical and illegal. The author should pursue legal channels, like a lawsuit for breach of contract, but actually sabotaging the company would make the author guilty of criminal acts.\n\nSo the author is wrong to consider such actions. They have a valid claim but the method of resolution is not appropriate. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the proposed action is illegal and unethical, regardless of the initial breach.\n"
