He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's company. The situation is that six years ago, the author helped build a website and POS system for their friend's business. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake, but the friend never paid and now has a multi-million dollar company. The author is considering taking action to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, they are enforceable but harder to prove. The author might not have a strong legal claim here, especially if there's no written contract. The friend hasn't acknowledged the agreement, so the author might struggle in court.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement. The author invested time and effort, and the friend benefited immensely from their work. However, the author is considering retaliatory action, which could be seen as harmful even if they feel wronged. Disrupting the company could cause significant harm, which might not be justified morally, even if the friend is at fault.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and code. They could legally pursue payment by offering to transfer ownership for the $2000 plus 5% stake. Taking destructive actions might be considered overstepping, regardless of the initial injustice. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have a valid grievance, but retaliating might not be the right approach. They might be in the wrong if their actions are malicious rather than seeking fair compensation through legal means. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because disrupting the company is not the appropriate response, even if the friend is at fault.\n"
