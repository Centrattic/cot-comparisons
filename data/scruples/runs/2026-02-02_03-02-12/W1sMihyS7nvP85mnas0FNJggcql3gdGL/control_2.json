He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's successful company. The situation involves a verbal agreement from six years ago where the author was promised payment and a 5% stake for designing a website and POS system. The friend didn't pay, ghosted the author, and now the company is worth millions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be legally binding, but it's harder to enforce. Since there's no written contract, proving the terms (like the 5% stake) might be tough. The author mentions that the domain and hosting are in their name, and they still have access. That's a key point because if they own those assets, they might have legal rights to them. However, using that to disrupt the company could lead to legal issues like breach of contract or even sabotage.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is really hurtful. The author feels wronged and is considering taking action. But is revenge or disruption justified? Even if they have a claim, taking action like removing code or domains could be seen as harmful and might lead to legal trouble. The author could pursue legal avenues to claim what's owed, but actively disrupting operations might cross a line.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they haven't received any communication except for occasional Facebook interactions. The friend's actions have caused personal distress, but that doesn't necessarily justify illegal or unethical actions. The author might be within their rights to seek payment, but the method of doing so matters. Threats or actual disruption could be considered malicious, even if there's a grievance.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were definitely wrong, the author's potential response could also be problematic. The author might have legal claims, but taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company could lead to legal consequences. The ethical stance would depend on the approach taken\u2014seeking legal redress is one thing, but sabotage is another. So, the answer is likely A (they're in the wrong) if they proceed with disruptive actions, as it's not the appropriate way to handle a dispute, even if the other party is at fault.\n"
