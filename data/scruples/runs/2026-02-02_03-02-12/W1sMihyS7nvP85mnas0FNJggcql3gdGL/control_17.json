He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nThe author, let's call them Person A, was asked by their friend (Person B) to design a website and a point of sale system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement where Person B would pay $2000 and give 5% stake in the company. Person A worked on it, put other projects aside, and the work took a couple of months. Then Person B ghosted them, cutting off contact except for occasional Facebook likes. Now, Person B is successful, owns two houses, has multiple stores, and is a millionaire. Person A is considering disrupting Person B's company because they haven't been paid the $2000 or the 5% stake. They still have access to the domain, hosting, and some of the code is still in use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations. Even if they had a verbal agreement, without written proof, it might be hard to prove in court. Person A might not have a legal claim here, especially if there's no written contract. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Person A did the work, and there was an understanding of payment. But Person B didn't follow through. However, taking matters into one's own hands by \"fucking over\" the company could be illegal. For example, if Person A has access to the domain and hosting, they could potentially delete or disrupt services. But that could be considered a criminal act, like sabotage or cybercrime. Even if they feel wronged, taking such actions could lead to legal consequences.\n\nAlso, the fact that Person A is considering revenge rather than trying to resolve it through legal means or negotiation might mean they're in the wrong. They could have sent a formal demand letter, tried mediation, or contacted a lawyer. Instead, they're thinking about destructive actions, which is unethical and possibly illegal.\n\nAnother point: the code and systems they created. If they never transferred the rights, legally they might still own the intellectual property. However, using threats of disrupting the company because of unpaid work might not be justified. Even if they have rights to the code, intentionally causing harm beyond seeking compensation (like through a lawsuit) is problematic.\n\nAlso, the personal relationship aspect. The friendship was important, and Person A felt betrayed. But seeking revenge in a harmful way could make them the villain, regardless of the initial wrong. The emotional aspect is valid, but the response needs to be proportionate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, Person A might not have a strong case due to the verbal agreement. Ethically, taking destructive actions is wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions. The answer should be A.\n"
