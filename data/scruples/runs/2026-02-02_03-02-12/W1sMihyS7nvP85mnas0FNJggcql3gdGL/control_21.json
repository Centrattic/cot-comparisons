He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and a stake in a company, which the friend didn't honor. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, leading to years of silence. Now, the author is considering taking action by disrupting the company's systems because they were promised payment but didn't receive it.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement is a key point. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but proving them can be difficult. The author might have a claim if they can prove the terms existed. However, since it's a verbal agreement, the friend could deny it, making it hard to enforce.\n\nThe author's actions, like removing access or destroying the POS system, could be illegal. Tampering with someone else's property, even if they owe you money, is a criminal act. The author might be committing fraud or theft by withholding domain and hosting details. Also, if the code is their intellectual property, they might have a valid claim to it, but destroying it could be seen as malicious, even if they have rights.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly hurt, which might cloud judgment. They might feel justified, but the method of seeking justice is questionable. Legally, they might have a case for unpaid work, but the way they're handling it could lead to legal trouble. The friend's success without proper compensation is a breach of contract, but the author's response could be considered retaliation rather than legal recourse.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be illegal and unethical, regardless of the friend's wrongdoing. They should seek legal counsel to pursue their claim through proper channels instead of taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to commit potentially illegal acts.\n"
