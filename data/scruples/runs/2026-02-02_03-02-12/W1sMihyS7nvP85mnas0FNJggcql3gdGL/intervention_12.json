He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Termed a [something]?\" (WIBTA) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after the project, the friend ghosted him. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get what they believe they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Verbal agreements, especially \"gentleman's agreements,\" can be hard to enforce. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be difficult. The author might not have a solid legal claim because there's no written agreement, and the friend denies it. So, even if the author did the work, without proof, it's a problem.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is considering sabotaging the friend's business. Even if the friend is in the wrong by not paying, retaliation through sabotage is unethical and illegal. It's one thing to pursue legal remedies, like suing for breach of contract, but another to take matters into one's hands by disrupting the business. Sabotage could involve deleting code, taking down the website, etc., which is criminal.\n\nAlso, the author mentions still having control over the domain and hosting. They could legally sell or transfer those to the friend, but using that leverage for revenge is problematic. The author's emotional response after being ghosted is understandable, but acting on it with destructive measures crosses a line.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions. He didn't pay, ghosted, and didn't provide the stake. That's clearly wrong, but the author's response (sabotage) isn't the right way to handle it. The proper approach would be to seek legal recourse, maybe through small claims court, but that requires evidence.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the right because their plan to disrupt the company is illegal and unethical, even if the friend wronged them. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions, while understandable in anger, are not justified.\n"
