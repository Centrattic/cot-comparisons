He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" post is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's company. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author helped start a company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't have the tools to make invoices then. The author worked on the backend, took time off other projects, and the designer got paid upfront but no stake. After delivery, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend is successful, owns two houses, and the company has six stores. The author hasn't received payment or acknowledgment. They still own the domain and hosting, and some code is still used.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to disrupt the company to get their money and stake. \n\nSo, legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, a verbal contract can be enforceable, but proving the terms might be difficult. The author has no written proof. The friend might argue there was no formal agreement. On the other hand, the author might have a case for breach of contract if the verbal agreement was clear and accepted by both parties. But proving that could be an issue.\n\nEthically, the author's actions depend on their methods. Taking control of assets they own (domain, hosting) might be justified if they have legal ownership. However, \"fucking his shit over\" could involve more drastic actions, like taking down the website or disabling the POS system, which could be illegal if they misuse their access. Even if they have ownership, intentionally disrupting a business could be seen as a criminal act, like sabotage.\n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. They felt wronged and have been stewing for years. But acting out of anger might lead to consequences. If they take legal action, that's one thing, but if they resort to hacking or other illegal methods, they could face charges.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions. Ghosting and ignoring communication is poor behavior. The author might feel justified in seeking what was promised, but the method matters. Legal steps, like small claims court, might be appropriate. However, the author choosing to disrupt the business could backfire, leading to legal trouble for the author.\n\nSo, the author's rightness depends on their actions. If they only reclaim what's legally theirs, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they go beyond that with malicious intent, they could be. The question is whether the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Based on the analysis, the author might not be in the wrong if they pursue legal means, but if they take illegal actions, they would be. The original question's scenario says \"completely fucked his shit over,\" which sounds illegal. So the answer would be A.\n"
