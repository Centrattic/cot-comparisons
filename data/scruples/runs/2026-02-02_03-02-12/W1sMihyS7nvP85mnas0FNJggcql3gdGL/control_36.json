He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's multi-million dollar company. The situation starts with a friend who started a company six years ago and asked the author to design the website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, and finished the work. Then the friend ghosted them, no communication, and later became super successful without paying. Now the author is thinking about messing up the friend's stuff because of the unpaid $2000 and the 5% they were promised.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many places isn't as solid as a written contract. But in some jurisdictions, verbal agreements can still hold up, especially if there's evidence of the agreement. However, proving the terms might be difficult without a written contract. The author mentions that the code is still in their name, and they have access. So, maybe they have some legal claim over the intellectual property. If they created the code without a formal agreement transferring rights, they might still own the code. That could be a point in their favor.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt the company. The author is thinking of taking retaliatory action, which is unethical and illegal. Even if they have a legitimate grievance, sabotaging someone's business is not an appropriate response. The appropriate action would be to seek legal recourse, like suing for breach of contract if the verbal agreement is enforceable. Instead, the author is considering malicious actions, which is definitely wrong regardless of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions of ghosting and not paying are also wrong. The friend had a responsibility to either pay or communicate. However, that doesn't justify the author's potential sabotage. The author's end goal of disrupting the company is illegal and unethical, so even if the original agreement wasn't honored, the author's actions would be in the wrong. So, the answer is likely A: Yes, the author is in the wrong because while the friend wronged them, the author's planned action is illegal and unethical.\n"
