He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's company. The key points here are the verbal agreement, the lack of payment, and the current consequences the author is thinking about taking.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them and didn't pay. Now the company is successful, and the author feels wronged. The question is whether taking action to disrupt the company is justified.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are enforceable in some cases, proving the terms might be difficult without written documentation. The author might not have a clear legal claim here, but that's a separate issue from moral or ethical considerations.\n\nEthically, the friend violated the agreement by not paying and cutting off communication. The author, on the other hand, is considering taking revenge by disrupting the business, which could harm the friend's success. Even if the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, the author's plan involves sabotage, which is generally considered unethical and possibly illegal.\n\nThe author's anger and sense of betrayal are understandable, but using their access to the systems to cause harm crosses a line. The friend's actions were wrong, but retaliation through damaging the business is not an appropriate response. The author could seek legal recourse or settle the matter privately, but disrupting the company is not justified.\n\nSo, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to retaliate is unethical and wrong. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt their friend's company.\n"
