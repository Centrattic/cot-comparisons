He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and equity, which wasn't followed through. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them is tough. Since there's no written contract, the author might have a hard time getting payment or equity through legal means. But maybe the friend didn't intend to honor the agreement from the start, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the author provided valuable work that contributed to the company's success. The friend benefited financially but didn't fulfill the agreed terms. The author's anger and feeling of betrayal are understandable. However, seeking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as wrong because it's harmful and possibly illegal. Even if the friend is in the wrong, retaliating might cross a line.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over some assets like the domain and code. They could potentially monetize that or demand payment. Instead of destroying the company, maybe they should pursue legal action or negotiate. Disrupting the company could lead to legal repercussions for the author, even if the friend was unethical.\n\nThe friend's actions were clearly wrong, but the author's response could also be problematic. Retaliation isn't a solution and might cause more harm. The right approach would be to seek what's owed through proper channels rather than sabotage. So, while the friend is at fault, the author might be in the wrong for considering such a drastic and potentially illegal action.\n"
