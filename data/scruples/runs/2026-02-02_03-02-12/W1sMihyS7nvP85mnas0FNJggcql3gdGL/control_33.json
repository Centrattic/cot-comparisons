He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's company. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend (let's call him X) started a company six years ago and asked the author (let's say Y) to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus a 5% stake. Y did the work but was ghosted afterward. Now, X is successful and a millionaire, but Y still hasn't been paid. Y has legal ownership over the domain, webhost, and some code, as there was no formal contract transferring exclusive rights.\n\nThe main question is whether Y is in the wrong for considering to \"fuck his shit over,\" which likely means Y is thinking of using their access to cause disruption. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be valid, but proving them is tricky. Since the work was done and X hasn't honored the agreement, Y might have a case. However, taking action like disabling systems could be illegal, even if the original agreement was unenforced. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. Y provided work and was promised compensation, but X didn't follow through. However, taking revenge by sabotaging the company could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that Y has access because of the lack of a proper contract might mean they have some legitimate claim, but intentionally causing harm could still be unethical, even if the friend had a valid debt.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether Y's potential actions (sabotage) are justified. Legally, Y might have a claim for the money and stake, but acting on it by disrupting the company could be illegal and thus wrong. Ethically, while X's actions were unethical in not paying, Y's retaliation might also be unethical due to the harm it could cause.\n"
