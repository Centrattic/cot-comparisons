He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement\u2014$2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked hard, took time off other projects, and even had a designer help. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them, leading to a long period of silence. Now, the friend is successful and the author is considering disrupting his business.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: verbal agreements can be tricky but not invalid. However, proving the terms (like the 5% stake) might be tough. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. That gives them leverage, but does it justify disrupting the company?\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and didn't follow through on payments. The author feels wronged and might see the disruption as a way to get their share. But is retaliation the right approach? Even if the friend is in the wrong, taking down the business could be seen as excessive. There's a difference between seeking compensation and causing harm.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could have legal repercussions. If the friend had a contract, maybe the author breached it by not releasing the code properly. But since the agreement was verbal and the author hasn't been paid, they might have a claim. However, the right approach would be to pursue legal action or mediation instead of sabotage.\n\nIn terms of morality, revenge doesn't always equate to justice. The author might feel justified, but disrupting a company could cause more harm than good, especially if innocent people are affected (employees, customers). The friend's actions were unethical, but should the author respond in kind?\n\nConsidering all factors, the friend is definitely in the wrong for breaking the agreement and not paying. The author has grounds for legal action to claim what they're owed. However, using sabotage could make the author equally at fault for causing harm. The right approach would be to seek compensation through proper channels, not personal revenge. So, the author might be in the wrong if they choose to disrupt the company instead of legally addressing the debt.\n"
