He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user wants to know if the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author designed a website and POS system for a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted after the work was done. Now, the company is successful, with multiple stores and millions. The author hasn't been paid and is considering disrupting the company to get what's owed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's start with the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are valid, but proving them can be hard without evidence. The author has no written agreement, which could make it difficult to enforce their claim legally. However, maybe there's some evidence like emails or messages that could support the verbal agreement. The fact that the domain and hosting are in the author's name might help them retain ownership of the code, depending on local laws.\n\nEthically, the author worked hard and was promised payment and equity. Being ghosted is really unfair, and not getting paid is a breach of the agreement. However, the author is considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which could involve actions like taking down the website, releasing code, or causing business disruption. That's where things get murky. Even if the friend is in the wrong, taking retaliatory actions might not be the best approach. It could lead to legal consequences for the author, like being sued for damages or intellectual property violations. Also, it's a personal relationship that's already broken, so revenge might not be the healthiest response.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might have had reasons for not paying. Maybe the business was struggling initially, or he didn't realize the value of the work. But given that the business is now successful, it's harder to justify not paying. The author's actions could be seen as justified in terms of seeking what's owed, but using harmful tactics might escalate the situation.\n\nThe author has access to the domain and hosting. They could legally request payment by threatening to take down the site, but that's still a form of leverage. However, threatening to disrupt a business could be illegal, depending on the method. Also, even if the code is theirs, the company might have developed it further, so there could be complications in ownership.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel wronged, but taking actions that harm the business could land them in legal trouble. They might be in the right morally but not legally. It's a classic case of \"the ends don't justify the means.\" The better approach might be to send a cease and desist letter, attempt to negotiate, or seek legal counsel to pursue the debt through proper channels.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in a tough spot. The friend breached the agreement, but the author's retaliatory actions could be both legally and ethically questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if they proceed with disruptive actions despite having a valid claim. They should pursue legal avenues instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
