He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" question is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's multi-million-dollar company. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author worked on a project for their friend six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend started a home business back then, didn't have invoices, etc. The author, being new to programming, put other projects on hold and worked for two weeks to get it functional and six more for tweaks. The friend hired a designer for the frontend who got paid $2000 upfront but no stake. After finishing, the author was ghosted, and the friend only gave minimal social media interactions. Now, the friend is successful, owns two houses, has six stores, and the author hasn't been paid. The author has legal control over the domain, hosting, and some code still in use. The question is whether the author would be in the wrong if they \"fucked his shit over\" to get the $2000 and potential millions from the stake.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The main issue is the verbal agreement. Verbal contracts can be tricky, especially if there's no written proof. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving the terms might be difficult. The problem here is that the author's friend has ghosted them and not honored the agreement. The author is now considering taking actions to reclaim what they believe is owed, possibly by disrupting the company's systems.\n\nOn one hand, the author did the work and provided value, and the friend didn't fulfill his part of the deal. The author could argue that they're entitled to the $2000 and the 5% stake. However, the friend might argue that the verbal agreement isn't valid or that the terms were different. Since there's no written contract, it's hard to prove. The author's friend might also claim that the work was an independent project and not part of a partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering actions that could be illegal, like messing with the systems. Even if the author has legal ownership of the domain and hosting, intentionally disrupting a company's operations could be considered cybercrime. The author having access to parts of the system might be a vulnerability, but using that to cause harm could lead to legal consequences. The friend's company is now successful, and the author's actions could harm not just the friend but also employees and customers if the systems go down.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend might have had legal reasons for not paying. Maybe the verbal agreement was never formalized, or there was an expectation of payment upfront. The author might have been an independent contractor, and the 5% stake could be considered an oral agreement that's hard to enforce without a written agreement. Plus, the author's friend might have moved on with the business, hiring others for maintenance, which could indicate that the original agreement isn't in place anymore.\n\nBut the author's friend did use the work they provided, and if the code is still in use without a proper license, the author might have a case in intellectual property. However, if the author was paid (even if it was supposed to be $2000 and 5%), maybe there's a different story. The friend not paying could be a breach of contract, but proving that without documentation is tough.\n\nThe emotional aspect is also there. The author felt betrayed and friends with the person, which adds to the complexity. But that doesn't justify illegal actions. The author's frustration is understandable, but taking matters into their own hands could lead to legal issues for them as well.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have a case in terms of the verbal agreement and unpaid work, the lack of written documentation makes it hard to enforce. Disrupting the company's operations would likely be illegal regardless of the situation. So, the author could be in the wrong if they take illegal steps to get what they believe is owed. However, if they pursue legal action through proper channels, that's different. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for \"disrupting,\" which implies illegal actions. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because taking such actions would be illegal and not advisable, even if there's a perceived injustice.\n"
