He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend ghosted after the work was done, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal contracts can be tricky. Depending on the jurisdiction, some agreements might be enforceable, but others might require written proof. The author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement\" which is probably not legally binding. So if they go to court, there's a chance they might not get the 5% or the $2000 because there's no written evidence. But maybe there's other evidence like emails or messages? The author says it was a verbal contract only they knew about, so maybe not much.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author worked a lot, put other projects on hold, and the friend didn't pay. The friend also cut off contact, which is really hurtful. The author is now thinking of taking revenge by disrupting the company's systems. But is that justified? Even if the friend wronged them, taking down the company could cause a lot of harm. The friend is now a millionaire, and the author is considering actions that could lose him millions. That seems like a harsh response, even if the friend was in the wrong initially.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting. Maybe they could use that to demand payment? But disrupting the company's operations would be illegal, regardless of the situation. Even if the author feels wronged, hacking or sabotaging the systems is not the right approach. They should pursue legal channels, like small claims court if possible, to seek compensation.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could affect other people. The company has six stores, employees, customers. Disrupting it could hurt innocent people. The friend might be wrong, but the author's retaliation could cause more harm than good.\n\nIn summary, while the friend likely wronged the author by not paying, the author is planning illegal and harmful actions. They should instead seek legal recourse. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for considering sabotage instead of legal action.\n"
