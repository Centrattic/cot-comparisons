He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. The situation involves a verbal agreement from six years ago where the author was supposed to get paid $2000 plus 5% equity for designing a website and POS system. But the friend ghosted them after the work was done, and now the company is worth millions.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. A verbal agreement is generally harder to enforce because there's no written proof. The author might have a hard time proving the terms in court. Even though they did the work and the company is using their code, without a contract, it's tricky. The friend might argue that the verbal agreement wasn't valid, especially if there's no evidence like emails or witnesses.\n\nThen there's the question of ethics. The author worked on the project, put in significant time, and was promised payment and equity. The friend didn't fulfill the agreement. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after not being paid or acknowledged for years. However, the proposed retaliation\u2014disrupting the friend's business\u2014could be seen as unethical. Even if the author feels wronged, taking matters into their own hands might cross the line.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain, hosting, and code. Legally, they might own those things because they weren't properly transferred. So the author could have valid claims over those assets. But using that access to disrupt the business could lead to legal consequences, like charges of sabotage or hacking.\n\nThe emotional aspect is there too. The author lost a friend and feels betrayed. That might fuel the desire for revenge, but it's important to consider if that's a justified response. Seeking legal recourse or negotiating a settlement would be more appropriate than taking destructive actions.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have legitimate grievances due to the verbal agreement and the friend's breach of trust, the plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is both legally risky and ethically questionable. The author could be in the wrong for planning to sabotage the business, regardless of the initial betrayal.\n"
