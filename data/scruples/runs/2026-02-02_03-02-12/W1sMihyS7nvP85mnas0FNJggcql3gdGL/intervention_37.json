He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. The situation is that the friend started a company six years ago and had a verbal agreement with the author to pay $2000 plus 5% stake for designing the website and POS system. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering messing up his company to get back the money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are valid but hard to prove. The author has no written evidence, so legally, it might be tough to claim the payment. However, there's also the issue of intellectual property. If the code is still in use and the domain/webhost are in the author's name, maybe there's a legal claim there. But without a contract, it's uncertain.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the verbal agreement and ghosted. The author might feel wronged. But using that as a reason to disrupt the company could be seen as revenge rather than justice. Even if the author has a case, sabotaging the company could be illegal and unethical. The author could pursue legal action for breach of contract, but taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the business could lead to legal trouble for the author.\n\nMoral implications: The author wants justice for the unpaid work and broken promise. However, the method of seeking justice by causing harm might be seen as disproportionate. There's also the personal relationship aspect\u2014using a friend's success as leverage through sabotage could be morally questionable, regardless of the original agreement.\n\nPossible consequences: If the author goes through with disrupting the company, they could face legal repercussions such as trespassing, sabotage, or intellectual property theft charges. The friend could retaliate, and the situation could escalate beyond just financial implications.\n\nAlternatives: The author could consult a lawyer to explore legal avenues for compensation. Even without a written contract, there might be ways to prove the verbal agreement through emails, messages, or witness testimonies. If the code is still under the author's ownership, they could legally demand its return or compensation for its use.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were clearly wrong, the author's planned response is not justified. The appropriate action would be to seek legal remedies rather than taking revenge through sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong if they proceed with disrupting the company.\n"
