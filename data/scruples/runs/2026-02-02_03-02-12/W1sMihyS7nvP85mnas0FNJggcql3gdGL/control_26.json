He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked for two weeks and then six more weeks on tweaks. The friend then ghosted them. Now the friend is successful and the author is considering disrupting his company.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court, but there's the possibility of a quasi-contract or something similar. The author did the work, and there's a promise of payment. The friend didn't pay, which is a breach of contract, even if verbal. But the author is thinking of disrupting the company, which is illegal regardless of the situation. Even if there's a claim, taking action like sabotaging the systems would be criminal and unethical.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and code. Legally, if the domain is registered under their name, they might have rights to it. But using that to disrupt the company could be considered theft or interference with business operations. The friend might have a claim if the code was supposed to be transferred, but since there's no formal agreement, the author might still have rights to their intellectual property. However, that doesn't justify sabotage.\n\nEthically, the author is angry and feels wronged, but taking revenge through destructive actions is not the right approach. Even if the friend is in the wrong for not paying, the author should seek legal remedies, like small claims court or consulting an attorney. Disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble for the author, including charges of sabotage, hacking, or theft. The answer should consider both legal and ethical angles. So the author is not in the right if they plan to disrupt the company. So answer A (they're in the wrong) because their actions are illegal and unethical, even if the friend breached the agreement.\n"
