He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's successful company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and a stake in the company, which wasn't honored. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them and now has a multi-million dollar business. The author is considering taking action to disrupt the company due to the unpaid $2000 and the 5% stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in many jurisdictions, proving the terms and that the agreement existed can be difficult. The author might have a case, but without written proof, it's hard to enforce. However, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which are in their name. That's a point in their favor if they decide to take action, but also raises legal issues if they shut it down.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted the author. The author worked hard, postponed other projects, and then was ignored. The friend is now successful without compensating them. The author's emotional distress over losing a friend and being unpaid is understandable. However, taking retaliatory action by disrupting the company could be seen as unjustified and harmful, even if the friend was wrong.\n\nLegally, shutting down the company's website and systems could lead to legal action against the author for sabotage or breach of contract. Even if the author owns the domain and hosting, the company might have other legal claims if the code was supposed to be transferred. The author's ownership of the code might be a gray area if they didn't have a formal agreement transferring rights.\n\nEthically, while the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, the author's potential actions could cross a line. Retaliation might not be the best approach, even if the friend was wrong. The author might have other recourse, like trying to negotiate a settlement or seeking legal help to enforce the verbal agreement.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling wronged, but taking disruptive action could be legally and ethically problematic. There might be better ways to address the situation without causing further harm. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong for feeling wronged but is in the wrong if they proceed with disruptive actions. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering it. The answer is A (Yes) because taking such actions would be illegal and unethical, despite the friend's wrongdoing.\n"
