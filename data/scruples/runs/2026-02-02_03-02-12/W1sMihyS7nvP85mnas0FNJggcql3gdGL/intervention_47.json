He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they disrupt their former friend's company.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author helped start the friend's company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. However, after completing the work, the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author feels wronged and is considering taking action, like destroying the company's systems, to get what they believe is owed.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, especially with money over a certain amount, verbal contracts can be enforceable but hard to prove without evidence. The friend ghosting suggests they might not intend to honor the agreement. The author has some control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. But legally, if there's no written contract, it's a gray area. Even if the author has a case, taking retaliatory action by destroying the company's systems would likely be illegal, regardless of the situation. Vandalism or sabotage is a crime, and even if the author feels entitled, the method of seeking justice could land them in trouble.\n\nEthically, the author might feel wronged, but the appropriate course of action would be to pursue legal remedies, like small claims court, if possible. Taking matters into one's own hands by disrupting the company could be seen as unethical and unlawful, even if the original agreement was breached. The author's friend might have breached the contract, but the author's actions could constitute another breach of the law, making them complicit in further wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is there. The author lost a friend and felt betrayed. But acting out of anger might escalate the situation and could lead to legal consequences. It's important to differentiate between being owed money and the means to recover it. The author might have a valid claim, but the method of enforcement is crucial.\n\nIn summary, while the friend likely broke the verbal agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not justified. The correct approach would be legal action, not sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
