He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system in exchange for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend ghosted after the work was done, leading the author to consider disrupting the friend's business to claim what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court. The author is now thinking of taking action by destroying the friend's systems, which is clearly illegal. Even if there's a claim, taking matters into one's own hands through sabotage is not justified. Legally, the author should pursue legal avenues like small claims court, not vandalism or sabotage.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author and the friend had a relationship. Ghosting is hurtful, but the author's response of potential sabotage is extreme. Ethically, revenge isn't acceptable, even if the friend wronged them. The author might feel wronged, but the method of addressing it is problematic.\n\nThe friend's current success and the author's resentment over being unpaid and cut off from a friendship could be valid reasons for feeling wronged. However, the solution proposed is harmful and could land the author in legal trouble. The author might have legal claims, like breach of contract (even verbal), but the appropriate action is through legal means, not personal retaliation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the domain and hosting are in the author's name might give them legal rights to those assets. If they take them down, it's a breach of computer fraud laws. So, while there might be a case for compensation, the method of action is definitely wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is that the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage the friend's business. Even though the friend might have breached the agreement, the author's actions are illegal and unethical. The correct approach is to seek legal remedies, not personal revenge.\n"
