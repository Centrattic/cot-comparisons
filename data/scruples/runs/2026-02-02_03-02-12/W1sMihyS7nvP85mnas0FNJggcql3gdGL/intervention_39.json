He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their former friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement where the author provided design and programming work for a friend's startup, expecting payment and a stake in exchange. However, the friend never paid and ghosted the author, leading to years of silence. Now, the friend is successful and the author is contemplating taking action to reclaim what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be difficult. The author has no written contract, which might complicate things in court. The fact that the domain and hosting are under the author's name could be a point in their favor regarding ownership of the website. For the POS system, if there's no agreement transferring ownership, the author might still hold the rights. However, using someone else's work without payment could be a legal issue, but without a contract, enforcement is tricky.\n\nEthically, the author's friend breached the verbal agreement, which is unfair. The friend's ghosting behavior adds to the ethical issue. However, the author's contemplated action of \"fucking his shit over\" sounds like sabotage, which is ethically wrong regardless of the situation. Even if the friend is at fault, retaliating with harm is not justified. The author could pursue legal action to claim what's owed, but direct sabotage crosses a line.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged and ignored, which is understandable. But acting out of anger or revenge can lead to legal consequences for the author, and it's not a constructive resolution. The correct path would be to seek legal advice to explore options like suing for the unpaid work or negotiating a settlement. Disrupting the company could be seen as malicious, even if the original agreement was broken.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were definitely unethical and possibly unlawful, the author's planned retaliation is also unethical and potentially illegal. The right approach would be to handle it through legal channels, not personal sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions, even if their friend was in the wrong initially.\n"
