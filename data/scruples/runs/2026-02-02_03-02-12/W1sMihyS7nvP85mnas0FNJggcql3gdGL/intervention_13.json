He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath?\" scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (let's call them Person A) designed a website and POS system for a friend (Person B) six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. Person A did the work, but Person B didn't pay and cut off contact. Now, Person B is successful, and the author is considering disrupting their company to get what they're owed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the verbal agreement's validity, the lack of payment, and the potential for the author to take action. Legally, verbal agreements can be binding, but proving them is tough. Since there's no written contract, Person B might argue there was never a formal agreement. However, the author did the work, and there's evidence like the domain and hosting under their name, and code still in use. \n\nEthically, Person A was let down by a friend who didn't follow through on a promise. The emotional aspect is significant here\u2014years of being ghosted and then finding out the friend is successful without them. But taking revenge by disrupting the company, even if they're in the right, could lead to legal trouble. Even if Person A has valid claims, destroying someone's business might be illegal, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe author's consideration of \"fucking his shit over\" is a destructive action. While the friend is in the wrong for not paying, the author taking similar aggressive actions could make them equally at fault. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the author has a valid claim, retaliating in a harmful way might cross a line. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of friendship. The author mentions they just wanted the friend back initially, but now it's about the money. The emotional hurt adds to the complexity. However, legally and ethically, taking down someone's business is a severe response. \n\nIn conclusion, while Person B is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, Person A's potential actions could be considered wrong too because they involve illegal or harmful behavior. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their retaliatory actions, regardless of the grievance, are not justified ethically or legally.\n"
