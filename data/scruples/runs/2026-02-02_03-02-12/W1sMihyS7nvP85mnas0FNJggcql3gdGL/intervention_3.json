He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a friend who started a company and had a verbal agreement with the author to provide a website and POS system in exchange for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend ghosted after the work was done, and now the author is considering taking action to disrupt the company because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. There was a verbal agreement, which is legally possible but harder to enforce. The author worked on the project, including a lot of their own time and effort, and the friend didn't pay. The author still has control over the domain, hosting, and some code. The friend is now successful with multiple stores, and the author feels betrayed because they weren't invited to major life events like a wedding.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to \"fuck his shit over.\" The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be valid but require proof. Since there's no written contract, it might be hard for the author to take legal action. However, the author still owns the domain and hosting, which are assets they controlled. If they remove access or destroy the code, that could be considered sabotage, which is illegal. Even if the author feels wronged, taking such actions could lead to legal consequences like being sued for damages. \n\nEthically, the author's feelings are understandable. They worked hard and weren't compensated, leading to a broken friendship. But responding by disrupting the business could be seen as revenge rather than a fair solution. There's also the aspect of the friend's current success\u2014maybe the author should pursue legal or negotiation paths first instead of taking destructive actions.\n\nBut the author mentions that a lot of their code is still in use, which they might own. If they have the rights, maybe they can demand payment or negotiate terms now. However, using their access to harm the business goes beyond seeking compensation and into sabotage, which is morally questionable regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author's potential actions (disrupting the company) might be seen as wrong because they could cause harm without a legal basis. Even if the author has grievances, the method of addressing them by damaging the business could be unethical and illegal. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
