He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author designed a website and POS system for a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted the author, leading to years of silence. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering taking action to disrupt it to get their money and stake.\n\nThe key points here are the verbal agreement, the lack of payment, and the current situation where the author still holds some control over the domain and code. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. However, the author did the work and the friend hasn't paid, which is a breach of their agreement. \n\nBut the question isn't about legal rightness but moral or ethical wrongness. The author is considering retaliatory action, which could be seen as harmful. Even if the friend was in the wrong by not paying, the author's response might be considered unethical because it's causing harm beyond seeking payment. \n\nThe author's actions could damage the friend's business, which is a form of revenge. Ethically, taking such steps might not be justified, even if the original agreement was broken. The proper course would be to pursue legal action, like suing for the owed amount, rather than sabotaging the business. \n\nSo, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. That makes the author's actions ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
