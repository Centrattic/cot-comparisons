He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked for two weeks to get it functional and then six more weeks for tweaks. There's mention of a designer being hired, who was paid $2000 up front but no stake. The friend then ghosted the author, didn't pay, and over time, the author feels wronged. Now, the author is considering disrupting the friend's company because they believe they're owed money and a stake.\n\nThe key points here are the verbal agreement and the lack of a written contract. Verbal agreements can be tricky, especially when it comes to legal enforceability. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements are legal but hard to prove without evidence. The author might not have a solid case if they took legal action, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong for considering disruptive actions, not the legal recourse.\n\nThe author mentions they still have access to the domain and hosting, and that their code is still in use. If they were to remove or disrupt these services, it could cause significant issues for the friend's company. But is that justified? The author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" seems like retaliation beyond typical legal remedies. Even if they feel wronged, taking such actions could be considered illegal (like sabotage or theft of services) and morally wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship aspect. The friend's actions of ghosting and excluding the author from major life events like a wedding might have caused emotional harm. However, the author's response of disrupting the company is a form of revenge, which isn't a legal justification. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they take action that's illegal or unethical, then yes, they'd be in the wrong regardless of the original agreement's validity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's potential actions are not legally or ethically justified. Even if the friend broke the verbal agreement, the appropriate response would be through legal channels or other means, not sabotage. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
