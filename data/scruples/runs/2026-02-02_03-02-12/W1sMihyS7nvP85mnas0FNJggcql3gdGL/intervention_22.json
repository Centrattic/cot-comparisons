He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their \"friend's\" multi-million dollar company.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend asked the author to design his website and POS system six years ago. There was a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, and the friend then ghosted them. Now the company is successful, the friend is a millionaire, and the author is contemplating taking action against him.\n\nSo, the key points here are the verbal agreement, lack of payment, and the current situation where the author still has control over some assets. The author might feel wronged because they believe they're owed money and recognition. However, the friend isn't acknowledging them anymore.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. Even though the author did the work, if there's no enforceable contract, the friend might not be legally obligated to pay. The author's potential actions, like disrupting the company's systems, could be considered illegal, especially if they have access to the domain and hosting. Destroying someone else's business property, even if there's a grievance, is likely illegal and unethical.\n\nEmotionally, the author is hurt and feels betrayed. But taking revenge by sabotaging the company could lead to legal trouble. The author might be in the right morally if the friend broke the agreement, but legally, the author's actions could cross into criminal behavior. So, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong because their intended actions are harmful and potentially illegal, regardless of the past betrayal.\n"
