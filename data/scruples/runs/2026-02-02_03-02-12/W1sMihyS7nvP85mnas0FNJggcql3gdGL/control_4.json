He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing their website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get what they feel is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, for certain types of contracts (like those involving real estate or over a certain amount), a written contract is required. Since this was a verbal agreement and the stake is 5%, which could be significant, the author might not have a strong legal case. Without a written contract, proving the agreement could be difficult, especially if the friend denies it.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author did the work, and the friend didn't pay. That's a breach of trust. But the author is considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which sounds like sabotage. Even if the friend wronged them, sabotage is illegal and unethical. Retaliation through destructive means is not acceptable, regardless of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which they set up. Legally, if those are in their name, they might have the right to manage them. However, using that to disrupt the business could lead to legal consequences. The friend might have a claim against the author for damages if they shut things down.\n\nThe author's actions, while understandable in terms of feeling wronged, cross into illegal territory. Sabotage is not a legitimate way to resolve a dispute. They should pursue legal avenues, like small claims court if possible, or seek mediation. But taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the business would make them at fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author has a valid grievance about unpaid work and broken promises, but their plan for retaliation is both illegal and unethical. Therefore, they would be in the wrong if they proceed with sabotage.\n"
