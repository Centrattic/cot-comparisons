He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get what they think they're owed.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user mentioned a \"gentleman's agreement\" which is a verbal contract. But in many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be legally binding, especially if there's evidence of the agreement and performance. However, proving such a thing can be tough without written documentation. The author might not have a strong legal case, but that doesn't mean they're entirely in the wrong morally.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement. The author did the work, and the friend benefited from it. The friend's actions\u2014ghosting and not paying\u2014could be seen as unethical. However, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" by, say, sabotaging the systems they built would be illegal and unethical. Even if the friend is at fault, retaliating with sabotage is not acceptable. The author has other avenues, like legal action or cutting off access, but intentional sabotage would cross a line.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which they could use to demand payment. But using that power to disrupt the company could be seen as holding it hostage. While the friend wronged them, the author's response needs to be proportionate. Sabotage isn't just wrong legally; it's also morally wrong because it harms others, potentially including employees or customers.\n\nSo even though the friend is at fault, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not justified. The correct answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong for seeking justice, but their method of doing so (sabotage) is wrong. Wait, the question is specifically asking if the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering disruption. Since the author's plan is illegal and unethical, they are in the wrong regardless of the friend's actions. Therefore, the answer might be A. But wait, the friend broke the agreement, so maybe the author isn't entirely wrong? Hmm.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of sabotaging is illegal and unethical, so regardless of the friend's actions, the author would be in the wrong to do that. Even if the friend is at fault, the author can't take matters into their own hands in such a way. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because their proposed action is not acceptable, even if the friend is wrong.\n"
