He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and point of sale system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake, but the friend never paid and ghosted them. Now, the author is considering disrupting the friend's company because they haven't been paid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them is tough without evidence. The author might have a case, but without documentation, it's hard. The friend's company is now successful, and the author still has some ownership of the domain and code. Using that to disrupt the company could be seen as sabotage, which is illegal. Even if the author feels wronged, intentionally harming the business could lead to legal consequences.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is clearly wrong. But taking revenge by causing damage isn't justified morally. The author could pursue legal action, like a small claims court, instead of taking matters into their own hands. Sabotaging the company could be seen as a breach of trust and could harm innocent people, like employees or customers.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the code and systems. They could potentially monetize their work or sell it, but disrupting operations would be more harmful. The fact that the friend is now retired and successful might make the author feel like they're being unfair, but that doesn't justify illegal actions.\n\nIn summary, even though the friend wronged the author, the author's plan to disrupt the company is likely illegal and unethical. They should seek legal remedies instead of taking revenge. So, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author's actions would be illegal and unethical, despite the friend's initial wrongdoing.\n"
