He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Do\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend's company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and equity.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but they're harder to prove. The author has no written contract, which complicates things. They mention having access to the domain and webhost under their name, and some code is still in use. That might give them some legal standing, but without a contract, it's uncertain. Ethically, the friend broke the agreement and the trust, which is a strong point for the author's side.\n\nHowever, the author is considering \"disrupting\" the company, which sounds like sabotage. That's clearly illegal and unethical, regardless of the situation. Even if the friend wronged them, taking revenge through harmful actions would be wrong. The author might have legal recourse, like suing for breach of contract, but that's different from taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAlso, the author's emotional response is understandable\u2014feeling betrayed and wronged. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for considering sabotage. The answer would hinge on whether their actions are justified. Since sabotage is illegal and unethical, the author would be in the wrong for doing that, even if the friend is at fault.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for the initial situation, but considering the disruption (sabotage) is where they cross into being in the wrong. Wait, the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is wrong for considering disruption. The disruption itself is the action in question. So if the author is thinking about doing something illegal, then they are in the wrong. But the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's plan to disrupt is the action in question. So if the author's plan is to do something wrong (sabotage), then they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes). Wait, but maybe the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the entire situation, including the friend's actions. Wait, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for disrupting the friend's company. The friend is the one who broke the agreement, but the author's response of disruption is also wrong. So the answer is A (Yes), because even if the friend is at fault, the author's planned action is wrong. So the correct answer is A.\n"
