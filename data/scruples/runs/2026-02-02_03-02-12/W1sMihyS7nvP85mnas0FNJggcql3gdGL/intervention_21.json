He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake for designing a website and POS system. The friend never paid and cut off contact. Now the author is thinking about taking action.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement's enforceability. In most places, verbal contracts can be valid, but they're harder to prove. The author has no written proof, which could be a problem if they took legal action. But the friend used the author's work without compensation, which might be a breach of contract, even if verbal.\n\nThen there's the question of ethics. The author did the work, but wasn't paid. The friend became successful using their work. The author's anger and feeling of betrayal are understandable. However, taking revenge by disrupting the company isn't a typical legal recourse. It's more of a personal retaliation, which could be seen as unjust.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and hosting. That gives them a lever to take action, but using that power could lead to legal consequences. The friend might have a claim to the domain if the agreement implied transferring ownership, even without payment. The author's argument is that since they weren't paid, they still own the rights. But legally, that's murky without a contract.\n\nThe friend's actions\u2014ghosting and not paying\u2014were definitely wrong. But the author's potential actions (disrupting the business) are illegal and unethical. Even if they feel wronged, legal means like suing should be considered instead of sabotage.\n\nSo, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not paying and cutting off contact, the author's plan to disrupt the company is also morally and legally questionable. The author's anger is justified, but their method of seeking redress isn't. They might be in the wrong for considering illegal actions, even if their initial situation is unfair. The answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their proposed actions are unethical and illegal, regardless of the friend's faults.\n"
