He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Be Termed As...\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend started a business six years ago. The friend asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, and the friend hired a designer who got paid upfront but no stake. After completion, the friend ghosted, no communication, and now the company is successful with multiple stores. The author hasn't been paid, and now they're considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nSo, the main points here are the verbal agreement's enforceability, the friend's failure to pay, and the author's potential actions. The author is thinking about taking drastic measures like taking down the website or POS system they built. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be legally binding but are hard to enforce without evidence. Since there's no written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The author might not have a strong legal claim here. But ethically, the friend did agree to pay and give a stake, then vanished without explanation. That's definitely a problem.\n\nThen there's the question of the author's actions. If they decide to disrupt the company's operations, that's a different issue. Even if the friend wronged them, taking revenge by damaging the company could be illegal. For example, if the domain and hosting are in the author's name, they might have the technical ability to take it down. But doing so could be considered sabotage or even a criminal act, depending on the jurisdiction. It's not just about being right or wrong but also about the legality of their actions.\n\nEthically, is the author justified? They were ghosted, which is hurtful, but seeking revenge through disruptive actions might cross a line. Even if they feel wronged, taking down a successful business could have severe consequences for others involved, like employees or customers. It's a matter of whether the ends justify the means.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they still have access to the domain and code. If they were to remove or alter these, it could be seen as theft of intellectual property if they don't have the right to do so. Even if they created the code, transferring ownership usually happens through a contract. Since there's no written agreement, it's unclear who legally owns the code. If the author hasn't transferred the rights, they might still own the code, but using it to disrupt the business could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, the friend definitely broke trust by not paying and cutting off contact. But the author's response could also be seen as wrong if they resort to illegal or unethical actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering such actions despite their grievances.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The friend is in the wrong for not fulfilling the agreement, but the author's potential actions could also be wrong. The correct answer would depend on whether the author's actions are proportionate and legal. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that their plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is likely illegal and unethical regardless of the circumstances, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
