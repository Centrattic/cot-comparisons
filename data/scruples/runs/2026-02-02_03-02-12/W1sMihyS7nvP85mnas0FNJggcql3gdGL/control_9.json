He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the person helped their friend start a company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus a 5% stake. But the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and is now successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they think is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts need to be in writing to be enforceable, especially for things like equity stakes. So even if they had a gentlemen's agreement, without a written contract, it might be hard to prove in court. The author might not have legal recourse here. But maybe the code is still under their name, so there's intellectual property involved. If the POS system and code are still being used without proper licensing, maybe the author has a case there.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is clearly a betrayal. The author worked hard and was left out of the loop. The friend is now successful, and the author hasn't been paid. Disrupting the company would be an act of revenge, which is understandable emotionally, but is it right? Retaliation isn't usually seen as acceptable, even if the person is in the wrong. But the friend's actions were unethical.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting, and the code is still in use. Legally, if the author owns the code, they could potentially take legal action, like suing for breach of contract or copyright infringement. But taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" could lead to criminal charges if they sabotage the systems. So even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's retaliation might be illegal.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they take legal action, maybe not. But if they disrupt the company directly, that's illegal and wrong regardless of the circumstances. The author might be justified in seeking what they believe is owed, but using destructive methods is not the right approach. The answer would depend on whether the author uses legal means or illegal ones. The post suggests they're considering the latter, which would make them wrong. So the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong if they disrupt the company).\n"
