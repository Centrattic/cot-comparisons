He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user helped their friend create a company's website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement to get $2000 plus 5% of the company. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them. Now the company is a multi-million-dollar business, and the author is considering disrupting it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they go through with it.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement. Legally, verbal contracts can be enforceable, but it's harder to prove without evidence. The author's friend didn't follow through on the payment or the stake. The author did the work, which the company still uses. The friend has access to the domain and hosting through the author's names, but it's still in the author's name. The author hasn't been paid and feels wronged.\n\nThe author's plan is to \"fuck his shit over\" to get the $2000 and the 5%. The key here is whether the author has a legal right to do that. Even if the friend breached the contract, the author's recourse is typically through legal channels, not taking matters into their own hands. Disabling the website or POS system would be a criminal act and could lead to liability for the author. \n\nAlso, the author has access to the domain and hosting. They could potentially sue for breach of contract, but that's a different approach. Disrupting the business would be illegal regardless of the situation. Even if the author feels wronged, taking down the systems would be theft or sabotage, which is illegal. \n\nThe friend hasn't paid, but the author's retaliation is not a legal solution. The correct path would be to seek legal remedies, like small claims court if possible, to recover the money owed. The author might have a case, but using illegal means to get the money would make them culpable.\n\nSo, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because their actions, while born from a breach of contract, are illegal and not the proper way to resolve the dispute.\n"
