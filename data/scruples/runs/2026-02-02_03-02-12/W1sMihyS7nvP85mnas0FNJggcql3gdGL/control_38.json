He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after the work was done, the friend ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they believe they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement might not hold up in court, especially since there's no written contract. The author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" which typically isn't enforceable. So legally, the author might not have a strong case to claim the 5% stake or the $2000. But then, the domain and hosting are in the author's name, and they still have access. That could be a point in their favor regarding ownership of the code.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The friend didn't pay and ghosted the author, which is clearly wrong. But the author is now considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which implies some form of sabotage. Even if the author feels wronged, taking retaliatory actions could be seen as unethical. Sabotaging someone's business, regardless of past grievances, is generally considered wrong because it's harmful and illegal.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could have legal repercussions. If they take down the website or disable the POS system, that could constitute cybercrime or destruction of property. The friend might have a case against the author for disrupting his business operations.\n\nThe author's motivations are understandable\u2014feeling betrayed and not compensated for their work. However, the method of seeking justice by disrupting a multi-million-dollar company is extreme. The appropriate course of action would be to pursue legal means, like small claims court, to recover the $2000, but the 5% equity without a contract is tricky. Since there's no written agreement, proving the terms might be difficult.\n\nMoreover, the author still has access to the domain and hosting. They could potentially use this to negotiate, maybe by threatening to take down the site unless they're paid. However, using such threats or actually doing it could cross into illegal activity.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the bond seems broken. The friend didn't maintain communication, which adds to the betrayal. But even so, sabotage isn't the solution. The author might have a case for the initial payment, but not necessarily the equity, and the method of seeking retribution is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't entirely in the wrong for feeling betrayed and seeking compensation, but their proposed actions (sabotage) are wrong both ethically and legally. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company).\n"
