He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and had a verbal agreement with the author to provide a website and POS system in exchange for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend ghosted after the work was done, and the author is now considering disrupting the company to get what they believe they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in some cases, proving the terms can be difficult. The author might have a hard time enforcing the 5% stake or the $2000 payment without a written contract. However, the author still owns the domain, hosting, and some code, which could be a point in their favor. Legally, if the work was done without a contract, the friend might not be obligated to pay, especially if the ownership of the work wasn't transferred.\n\nThen there's the moral and ethical angle. The author did the work, and the friend didn't follow through on the agreed terms. The friend's actions of ghosting and not acknowledging the author seem unethical. However, the author is considering retaliatory actions, like disrupting the company's systems. Even if the friend wronged them, taking revenge by damaging the company could be seen as harmful and possibly illegal, regardless of the prior mistreatment.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the friendship. The author mentions that they were good friends for 15 years. The friend's behavior of cutting off communication and not inviting them to major life events (like a wedding) suggests a breach of trust. But does that justify the author taking actions that could harm the friend's business? Even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" might be considered disproportionate and vengeful.\n\nAlso, the author's ownership of the domain and code is a factor. If the code is still being used without proper licensing, the author might have legal grounds to demand compensation or to reclaim the assets. Instead of disrupting the company, they might be better off seeking legal advice to negotiate or litigate their claims. Taking unilateral action could lead to legal consequences for the author, such as being accused of sabotage or theft, even if the original agreement was breached.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the friend's actions were clearly wrong, the author's proposed retaliation crosses a line. It's important to address grievances through appropriate channels rather than taking matters into one's own hands, no matter how justified one feels. The author's anger is understandable, but the proposed action is not a constructive or legal way to resolve the issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The friend was in the wrong by breaking the verbal agreement and cutting off the author. However, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not the right approach. While the friend's actions were unethical, the author should pursue legal means to address the issue rather than resorting to sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to retaliate in such a way, even if the friend was at fault.\n"
