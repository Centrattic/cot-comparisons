He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement where the author was supposed to get $2000 plus a 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, and the friend ghosted them after the work was done. Now, the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them might be hard. Since there's no written contract, it's a gentleman's agreement, which the user mentioned is \"worth nothing.\" But in some jurisdictions, verbal contracts are enforceable if there's evidence of the agreement. However, without witnesses or written proof, it's tough. The author might have a hard time taking legal action here.\n\nThen, the ethical side. The friend didn't pay, which is a breach of the agreement. The author did the work, and the friend benefited from it. The author's work contributed to the company's success, which is now a multi-million-dollar business. The friend hasn't acknowledged the agreement, which is unfair. But the author is considering disrupting the company, which could be seen as malicious. Even if the friend is in the wrong, taking revenge by messing up the company could harm others, like employees or customers, and might be illegal.\n\nThe author still has control over the domain and hosting, and some code is theirs. They could legally take action, like reclaiming the domain or stopping the POS system. However, doing so might be considered theft or a breach of trust if they no longer have a right to it. If the friend never paid, does that mean the author can withhold access? That's a gray area. Maybe the author could sue for breach of contract, but self-help remedies like disrupting the business might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the personal relationship is over. The friend cut off contact, so the author isn't just seeking money but closure. The emotional aspect is significant here. But acting out of anger might not be the best approach. Legally, if the author disrupts the company, they could face legal consequences for sabotage, even if they have a claim for unpaid work.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be paid for their work. The friend is the one who broke the agreement. However, the method of seeking payment is questionable. Instead of disrupting the company, the author should pursue legal avenues. If they can't prove the verbal agreement, then maybe they are out of luck. But if they can, then the friend is in the wrong. The author's actions might be justified in terms of moral debt but not legally. So the author is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to be paid, but their method of doing so could be problematic.\n"
