He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's company. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author did design a website and POS system for their friend who started a company. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted. Now the company is successful, the friend is a millionaire, and the author is considering taking action to \"fuck his shit over\" regarding the money owed.\n\nFirst, legal standpoint. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, they are legally binding, but proving the terms can be hard. The author might have a case for the $2000 and the 5% stake, but without written evidence, it's difficult. If the author sues, they'd need to prove the agreement existed and the terms. But the friend might deny it, making it hard for the author to win. Also, the friend hasn't acknowledged the debt, which complicates things.\n\nThen there's the ethics. The author did the work, expecting payment and equity. The friend didn't follow through, which is dishonest. The author feels wronged, and the situation has been ongoing for six years. The emotional aspect of losing a friend adds to the hurt. \n\nHowever, taking legal action versus \"disrupting\" the company is a big difference. If the author is threatening to take down the website or sabotage the POS system, that's illegal. Hacking or interfering with someone's business operations is a criminal act, regardless of the dispute. The author's access to domain and hosting might be from when they registered it, but using that access to cause harm could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that a lot of their code is still used. If the author owns the code, they might have the right to license it or demand compensation. But again, threatening to remove it without legal action could be a breach of ethical standards, even if they own it. There's a difference between asserting one's rights through proper channels and taking retaliatory actions.\n\nSo, the author has a valid argument in terms of the original agreement, but their proposed actions (disrupting the company) cross into illegal territory. The right approach would be to seek legal advice, possibly send a demand letter, or pursue civil litigation. Threatening to damage the company's operations is not justified, regardless of the grievance.\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision to hold onto access and code could be seen as leveraging their position, but since the friend didn't pay, maybe they have a point in terms of ownership. However, using that access to cause harm is where they go wrong. They need to resolve the dispute through legal means rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nIn summary, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's response of potentially sabotaging the company is also wrong. The correct path is legal action, not self-help measures that could lead to criminal charges.\n"
