He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. Let me look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement from six years ago. The friend asked the author to design his website and POS system. They agreed on $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects on hold, and spent two weeks getting it functional and six more weeks on tweaks. Then there's a designer involved who got $2000 up front but no stake. The friend then ghosted the author, no payments, no communication except minimal stuff on social media. Now the friend is successful, owns two houses, has six stores, and is a millionaire. The author still has access to the domain and hosting under their name, and parts of their code are still in use. The author is considering messing up the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is justified in taking such action. Let's consider legal aspects first. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. The 5% stake might not hold up legally without a written agreement. The friend ghosting them is bad, but legally, the author might not have grounds to demand payment unless there's a valid contract. However, the domain and hosting being in the author's name could be a point in their favor if they can claim ownership of the assets.\n\nEthically, the author feels wronged because they invested time and effort, and the friend didn't follow through on the agreement. The friend's actions of ghosting and not communicating are inconsiderate and possibly unethical. However, the initial agreement's validity is a gray area. The author's proposed response\u2014disrupting the company\u2014is clearly unethical and illegal. Even if they feel wronged, taking retaliatory actions like sabotaging the company would be illegal and could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nThe friend's actions are questionable, and there might be some moral obligation to compensate the author. But the author's solution is not appropriate. The right course of action would be to seek legal advice, possibly send a demand letter, or take legal action if necessary. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt the company. Since the author is contemplating an illegal act (sabotage), regardless of the circumstances, they are in the wrong. Even if their initial agreement was breached, their response crosses legal and ethical boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their intended action is illegal and unethical, even if the friend's behavior was unethical. The proper recourse is through legal means, not personal retaliation.\n"
