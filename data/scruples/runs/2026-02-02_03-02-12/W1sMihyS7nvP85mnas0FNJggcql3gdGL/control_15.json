He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, six years ago, the author's friend started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, taking time off other projects, and it took two weeks to get functional and six more weeks for tweaks. The friend hired a designer who got paid $2000 but no stake. After finishing, the friend ghosted the author. Now, the company is successful with multiple stores and the friend is a millionaire. The author hasn't been paid, and the friend hasn't acknowledged them beyond minor social media interactions. The author still has access to the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. Now the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be legally binding but are hard to enforce, especially without evidence. The author hasn't been paid, but the friend isn't responding. The author's code is still in use, so maybe there's a claim to intellectual property rights. If the author created the code as an independent contractor, they might own the copyright unless there's a written agreement transferring it. Since the friend didn't pay, maybe the author can claim ownership and demand compensation.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the verbal agreement, which is a breach of trust. The author fulfilled their part, but the friend didn't honor the agreement. However, the author is considering retaliatory actions, like disrupting the company. Even if they have a legal claim, taking action like breaking into the systems or causing harm could be illegal and unethical. The author might have legal recourse through small claims court or a lawyer, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" could lead to legal trouble for the author as well.\n\nSo, the author might have a legitimate grievance, but their proposed solution is not the right approach. They could be in the wrong if they commit illegal acts to retaliate. However, the original breach by the friend is definitely wrong. The question is whether the author's response is justified. Since disrupting the company could be illegal and unethical, the author is in the wrong for planning such actions despite their valid claim.\n"
