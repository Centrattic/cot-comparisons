He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement for payment of $2000 plus 5% stake in the friend's company. The author put in a lot of work, over two months, and the friend later ghosted them. The friend didn't pay anything, didn't communicate, and now he's super successful with multiple stores and houses. The author still has domain and hosting under their name, and their code is still being used.\n\nSo, the main points here are the verbal contract, the lack of payment, and the current situation where the author is considering taking action. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky, but in some places they are enforceable. However, proving the terms might be hard. The author hasn't been paid, which is a breach of contract if the agreement was valid. But since it's verbal, there's no written proof, making it difficult to enforce legally.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the promise, which is a betrayal of trust. The author might feel wronged, especially after investing significant time and effort. But taking revenge by disrupting the company could lead to legal consequences. Even if the author has ownership of the domain and code, using that to sabotage could be illegal. For example, hacking or destroying property is a crime.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could legally pursue a claim if they can prove the verbal agreement existed. That might be challenging, but possible through emails, messages, or witnesses. The key is whether the author can take legal action without resorting to sabotage.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose to disrupt the company, that's illegal regardless of the situation. Even if the friend breached the contract, the author can't take the law into their own hands. So, while the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, the author is wrong to retaliate with actions that could cause harm. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're planning to commit illegal acts, even if the friend is the one who breached the agreement.\n"
