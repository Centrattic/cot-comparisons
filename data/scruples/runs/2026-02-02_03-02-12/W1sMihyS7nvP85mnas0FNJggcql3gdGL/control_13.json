He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author (let's call them Person A) designed a website and point-of-sale system for a friend (Person B) six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% of the company. Person A worked on it for weeks, and a designer was also hired, who got paid $2000 upfront but no stake. After the work was done, Person B ghosted them, cutting off communication. Now, Person B is successful with multiple stores and a million-dollar company. Person A is considering disrupting the company to reclaim what they believe is owed.\n\nSo, the core issue is about the validity of the verbal agreement and whether Person A is justified in taking action against Person B. Legally, verbal agreements can be binding, but proving them is tough. However, in this case, there's no written contract, which might make it hard for Person A to enforce the 5% stake or the $2000. But Person A still has ownership of the domain, hosting, and some code, which they didn't transfer because they weren't paid. That's a key point.\n\nNow, the question is if Person A is in the wrong for considering disrupting the company. Legally, even if there was a verbal agreement, sabotage is not a legal remedy. But ethically, maybe Person B wronged them by not paying and ghosting. However, taking retaliatory action like disrupting the company's operations could be considered wrong regardless of the circumstances because it's harmful and illegal, even if motivated by a sense of justice.\n\nAlso, the fact that Person A still has control over the domain and code could be used to negotiate or seek payment through legal means, like small claims court if possible. Sabotage would be a criminal act and could lead to legal trouble for Person A. Even if they feel wronged, the appropriate action would be to seek legal advice rather than take matters into their own hands.\n\nOn the other hand, Person B didn't honor the agreement, which is unethical. But the method of seeking redress matters. The author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is not a legal or ethical way to resolve a dispute, even if the other party is at fault. So, while Person B might be in the wrong for not fulfilling the agreement, Person A's potential actions would make them legally and ethically wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their intended actions are illegal and unethical, regardless of the initial dispute.\n"
