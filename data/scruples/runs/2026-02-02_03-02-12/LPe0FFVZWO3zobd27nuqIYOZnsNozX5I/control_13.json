He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their girlfriend treating their dog, Moose, badly. The user is asking if they're at fault for being upset about how their girlfriend treats the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author has a close bond with Moose, who's well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has started coming over, and there are several issues. She shouted at the dog, wants him off the sofas, smacked him, and so on. The author lists eight specific issues with her treatment of the dog.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The author's perspective is that Julia's actions are harmful to the dog and their relationship with him. They tried to compromise, like leaving the door open, but Julia didn't follow through. The author is against physical punishment and thinks Julia's behavior is unacceptable.\n\nNow, considering animal welfare, hitting a dog is generally considered abusive. Smacking the dog twice is a red flag. Also, not giving treats when asked could be neglect if the dog is used to it. The author's stance against hitting the dog is valid. Julia's jealousy might be affecting her treatment of Moose, which isn't healthy for the dog or the relationship between the couple.\n\nThe author is standing up for their pet, which is their responsibility since they own the dog. They've tried to communicate and compromise, but Julia isn't respecting their boundaries. Since Julia doesn't live there, her control over the dog's treatment is questionable. The author has every right to be upset if Julia isn't respecting their rules and harming the dog.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their concerns are valid, especially regarding the physical harm and neglect. Julia's actions are problematic, and the author is justified in seeking to address the situation.\n"
