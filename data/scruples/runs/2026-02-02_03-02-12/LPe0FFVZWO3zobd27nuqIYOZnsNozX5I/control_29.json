He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author, a 21-year-old guy, has a close bond with his 3-month-old St. Bernard, Moose. He's been living alone with the dog since getting him, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, 23, lives with her parents, so they spend more time at his place. The main issues start when Julia comes over and starts sleeping over.\n\nThe problems include Julia shouting at the dog, not allowing him in the room, refusing to give treats, smacking the dog, and other negative behaviors. The author has tried to compromise but feels his efforts aren't respected. He's concerned about the dog's well-being and is frustrated by Julia's actions.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the author is the owner of the dog and has the responsibility for his care. Julia isn't living there, so her influence on the dog's environment is limited. The girlfriend's actions, like smacking the dog and not following the agreed compromise, could be harmful. The author is standing up for his pet's treatment, which is reasonable. He's tried to communicate and make compromises but Julia isn't respecting his boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are the treatment of the dog. Smacking the dog is a red flag, as the author mentions he's never had to do that. The dog's well-being is a priority. Since the dog lives with the author, he has the right to set rules about how the dog is treated, especially when his partner is visiting. The jealousy angle might explain her behavior, but it doesn't justify mistreatment. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's pets and boundaries is important. If Julia can't respect the dog's needs and the owner's wishes, that's a problem. The author is not in the wrong for being upset and wanting to address the issues. He's advocating for his pet's welfare, which is a valid concern.\n"
