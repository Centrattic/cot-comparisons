He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So, the author is a guy with a St Bernard named Moose. He's been living alone with Moose since getting him, and the dog is well-behaved. They have a close bond. Then he starts dating a girlfriend, Julia, who's been over to his place a lot. The problem is how Julia treats Moose.\n\nFirst, when Julia first came over, Moose was protective by sitting next to the author, which is normal behavior for a big dog. When Julia started sleeping over, she made Moose leave the room, shouting at him. The author was upset because shouting could stress the dog and disrupt his routine. They compromised by leaving the door open. But the issues continued.\n\nNow, the list of things Julia does: she won't give Moose treats when asked, ignores him when he wants attention, wants him to sleep in the kitchen (which is too cold), smacked him twice, says she's jealous of him, calls him annoying even though she has three big dogs she likes, screams at him when he barks, and feeds him less. The author has tried to address this but Julia isn't listening.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong for being upset with Julia's treatment of his dog? The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate that.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. Moose is his best friend, and he's responsible for his care. Julia, being a new person in the house, is affecting Moose's environment. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being. Julia's actions could be seen as neglectful or harmful\u2014especially the physical punishment (smacking) which the author opposes. Also, Moose is a pet he's raised, so the author has the right to set boundaries on how others interact with him.\n\nJulia's actions might stem from jealousy or not understanding the bond. But hitting the dog is a red line. Also, denying treats and altering feeding amounts without the owner's consent is problematic. The author is protecting his pet, which is a valid concern. The fact that Julia has other dogs but dislikes Moose might indicate inconsistency in her behavior. The author's attempts to compromise were met with resistance, and Julia isn't respecting his wishes about Moose's care.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Julia feels her needs aren't being considered. If she's uncomfortable with the dog in the room, she might have communicated that differently. However, the author has made it clear that Moose's care is important. The key issue here is that Julia's actions are harmful to the dog, and the author is justified in being upset. The author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his pet's well-being. Julia is the one acting inappropriately by hitting the dog and not respecting the author's rules. The author's concern is about the dog's welfare, which is a primary responsibility. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
