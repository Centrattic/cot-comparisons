He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author's girlfriend treating his dog badly. The author is upset about how she's treating Moose, their St Bernard. He lists several issues: she won't give treats, ignores the dog, wants him in the kitchen (which is too cold), smacked him twice, and other things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author and Moose are close, and he's the dog's owner. The girlfriend is visiting often, and her behavior toward the dog is causing conflict. The author is defending his dog's treatment and is upset by her actions. The key question is whether the author is wrong for being upset about this.\n\nThe girlfriend is living with her parents, so she's a guest in the author's home. As the owner, he has the right to set rules about how his pets are treated in his space. If she's being abusive, like smacking the dog, that's a serious issue. The author has a responsibility to protect his pet from harm. Also, the dog's well-being is important, and sudden changes in environment (like being screamed at, moved to a cold kitchen) can stress the animal.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is mentioned, which might explain some of her behavior, but that doesn't justify being abusive or neglectful. The author has already tried to compromise, like the door being open so the dog can come in later, but she's not following through. The author is firm about not allowing physical punishment of the dog, which is a valid stance because positive reinforcement is widely recommended in dog training.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have set clearer boundaries from the start. However, the girlfriend's actions are crossing into harmful territory. The author's concern for the dog's emotional and physical well-being is reasonable. The dog is a family member in his home, and she's not respecting that.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, and he's justified in wanting her to stop. The answer should be B (No).\n"
