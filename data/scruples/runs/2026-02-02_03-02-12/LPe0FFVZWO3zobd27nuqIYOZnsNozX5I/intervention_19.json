He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The author has a strong bond with Moose, who is well-trained. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and there are several issues that have arisen.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that Julia shouts at the dog, wants him off the sofas (even though she doesn't live there), gives him fewer treats, smacks him, and isolates him. The author is concerned about the dog's behavior and well-being, having raised him alone. He's tried to compromise but feels Julia is dismissive and not respecting his wishes as the dog's owner.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with Julia's treatment of his dog. From what's described, the author is the legal owner, and the dog is his responsibility. Julia's actions, like physical punishment and not following the owner's instructions, seem to overstep. Dogs can be affected by sudden changes in environment or harsh treatment, so the author's concern about the dog's emotional state is valid.\n\nHowever, maybe some might argue that Julia has her own preferences and the author should have set clearer boundaries earlier. But given that the dog is his and he's the primary caregiver, the author has the right to expect that others, even partners, respect the dog's needs and his authority as the owner. The fact that Julia is new to Moose and not living with him might explain some of her behavior, but that doesn't justify mistreatment.\n\nThe author has already tried to address the issues with compromise but to no avail. The list of grievances seems extensive, and the key issue is the physical punishment (smacking), which is generally considered inappropriate in modern dog training. The author's stance against it is correct. Julia's jealousy and the way she treats the dog might indicate underlying issues in the relationship, but that's separate from whether the author is in the wrong regarding the dog's treatment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
