He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who's upset with his girlfriend for how she treats his dog. The girlfriend is doing several things that he doesn't agree with, like shouting at the dog, smacking him, not giving treats, and trying to move the dog to the kitchen. The man thinks she's being unfair to his dog, which is his best friend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The man has a close bond with his dog, which he's had for three months. The girlfriend started coming over and the dog was protective, which is normal behavior. The main issues start when the girlfriend wants the dog out of the room when they sleep. The man tried to compromise by leaving the door open. Then the girlfriend starts being more aggressive\u2014smacking the dog, which the author is against. She also restricts treats, ignores the dog, and feeds him less.\n\nThe author is firm on not allowing the girlfriend to hit the dog and is trying to set boundaries by not letting her feed the dog anymore. The girlfriend's actions seem to be causing stress to the dog, like the dog feeling guilty. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and the girlfriend's jealousy.\n\nNow, from a rights perspective, the owner is responsible for the dog's care. The girlfriend isn't the owner, so she shouldn't be making decisions about the dog's treatment. Smacking the dog is a form of physical punishment, which many experts consider inhumane. The author is correct in opposing that. The girl's behavior is crossing the line by altering the dog's routine and treating him poorly without the owner's consent.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is also a red flag. It's not healthy for her to be envious of the dog, as that indicates possible issues in the relationship. The author is trying to address her behavior, which is reasonable. He's not in the wrong for standing up for his dog. The girlfriend's actions are harmful, so the author is justified in wanting her to stop. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
