He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong regarding how his girlfriend treats his dog. The author and his girlfriend have been together for four months. The dog, Moose, is a St Bernard and they have a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, is causing issues by being harsh with the dog, shouting, smacking him, not giving treats, etc. The author is upset and considers telling her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the treatment of the dog. The author mentions that Julia has smacked the dog twice, which the author firmly opposes. Physical punishment of a pet is generally considered inappropriate and can be harmful. The author is protecting his dog's well-being, which is understandable. \n\nJulia's actions include shouting, not following the compromise (like keeping the door open), and making the dog sleep in a cold kitchen. These actions could be stressful for the dog, especially since he's sensitive to new people. The author is trying to manage the situation by setting boundaries and finding compromises, but Julia isn't respecting those. \n\nThe author's main argument is about the treatment of Moose, his responsibility as the dog's owner, and Julia's failure to respect his rules. Since Julia is not living there and thus doesn't have the same authority or responsibility, her interference in how the dog is cared for might be overstepping. \n\nHowever, in a relationship, there's a need for mutual respect and communication. The author has tried to address her behavior and made compromises, but Julia hasn't followed through. The author is justified in being upset, especially if the dog's well-being is at stake. \n\nIf the author is acting to protect his pet from what he perceives as mistreatment, he's not in the wrong. Julia's actions cross into abusive behavior if she's physically punishing the dog. The author has the right to set boundaries about how his pet is treated. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author be in the wrong? Maybe if he's being too controlling, but given the physical harm (smacking), that seems less likely. The author's concerns are valid, and Julia's jealousy of the dog's attention might be a red flag in the relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. Julia's actions are inappropriate, and he's justified in wanting to address the issue to protect his dog. The answer should be B.\n"
