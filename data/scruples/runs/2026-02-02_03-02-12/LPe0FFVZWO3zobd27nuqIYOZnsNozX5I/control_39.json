He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a close bond with his St Bernard, Moose. He's been living with Moose alone and they have a good routine. The girlfriend, Julia, has been visiting since they started dating four months ago. The problems started when she came over. Moose was protective, sitting next to the author on the sofa. When she started sleeping over, she made Moose sleep in the kitchen, shouted at him, and later smacked him. The author is upset about her behavior towards the dog, especially the physical punishment and ignoring the dog's needs.\n\nThe key points here are about the treatment of the dog. The author is the dog's owner, so he has the right to decide how the dog is treated. Julia is visiting, so she doesn't live there, yet she's imposing her rules. The author is against physical punishment and wants consistency in Moose's care. Julia's actions include shouting, physical smacking, not giving treats, changing the sleeping arrangements, and being generally unkind. \n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open, but Julia continues her behavior. The author is now considering confronting Julia to stop these actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and wanting to address this.\n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective, physical punishment is generally discouraged. Smacking the dog could cause fear or aggression. The author is concerned about Moose's well-being and the stress from inconsistent treatment. Julia's jealousy and resentment towards the dog might be underlying issues here, causing her to act out. \n\nSince the dog is the author's responsibility, and Julia isn't the owner, she shouldn't be making decisions about his care unless agreed upon. The author is protecting his pet's well-being and routine. The fact that Julia is visiting doesn't give her authority over how the dog is treated. The author's actions to address the situation are justified because he's the one who is responsible for Moose's upbringing and care.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his dog's welfare against someone who isn't the owner. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
