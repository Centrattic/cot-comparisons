He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a 21-year-old guy with a St Bernard named Moose. He's been in a four-month relationship with his girlfriend, Julia, who lives with her parents. They spend time at his place, and Moose is a big part of his life.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Moose is his best friend and very well-behaved. When Julia started coming over, Moose became protective, sitting at his feet and on the sofa. That's natural for dogs to be territorial, especially with a new person. The main issue arises when Julia starts sleeping over. On the first night, she yells at Moose to get out of the room, which the author finds problematic because he thinks it's harsh and could upset the dog. He compromises by leaving the door open so Moose can come back. \n\nThen Julia starts other behaviors: not giving treats when asked, smacking Moose twice, ignoring him, wanting him to sleep in a cold kitchen, etc. The author lists these as issues and asks if he's in the wrong for being upset and considering telling her to stop.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong, we need to consider both sides. The author is the owner of the dog and has a close bond with him. He's responsible for Moose's well-being. Julia's actions\u2014yelling, smacking, not following the agreed compromise, and giving negative attention\u2014could be harmful to Moose. The author is advocating for his dog's treatment, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, Julia might feel that her preferences and comfort are also important. However, since she doesn't live there, her demands about the dog's treatment might be overstepping. The fact that she's jealous of the affection given to Moose could be a red flag, but that's her emotional response. The key here is whether Julia's actions are acceptable. Physical discipline (smacking) is a major issue, as it's not recommended and can traumatize the dog. Also, yelling and refusing to give treats without a valid reason isn't helping the dog's training or well-being.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open. But Julia isn't respecting his boundaries and the agreed-upon solutions. The author is within his rights to address this, as he's the dog's owner and responsible for his care. The fact that the dog is reacting negatively (like being sad or guilty) supports the author's concern.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and needing to address the situation. Julia's actions are harmful, and the author is protecting his pet. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
