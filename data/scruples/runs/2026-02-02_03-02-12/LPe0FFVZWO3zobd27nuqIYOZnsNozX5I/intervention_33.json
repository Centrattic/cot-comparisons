He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the author has a dog, Moose, and they've been close since he got him. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and there are several issues with how she treats the dog.\n\nFirst, the main points: Julia shouted at the dog, wants him off the sofa, won't give treats when asked, smacked him twice, and has other behaviors that the author disagrees with. The author tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening, and he's considering ending things if she continues.\n\nThe author is defensive of his dog, which is understandable. Moose is his best friend, so the bond there is strong. The girlfriend is new to the situation, and maybe she's not used to the dog's presence or her own jealousy is affecting her behavior. But the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how Julia treats his dog.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to protect his pet and ensure he's treated well. The dog is his responsibility, and if Julia is acting in a way that's harmful or stressful for the dog, that's a problem. The author tried to compromise but Julia isn't respecting his boundaries or the dog's training and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, Julia is a new partner, and maybe she's just adjusting. But she's been with him four months, so it's not like it's a very short time. The fact that she's smacking the dog is a red line. Physical punishment is not acceptable, so that's a strong point against her. Also, yelling and being inconsistent with feeding could be problematic.\n\nThe author is clearly the dog's primary caregiver. He made clear his expectations, but Julia isn't following through. The author's response\u2014telling her to stop or risk ending the relationship\u2014seems reasonable given that his dog's well-being is at stake. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Julia's actions are the issue, and the author is justified in being upset and taking action to protect his pet.\n"
