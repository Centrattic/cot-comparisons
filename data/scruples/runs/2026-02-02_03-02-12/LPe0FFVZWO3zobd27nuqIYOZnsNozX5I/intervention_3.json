He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. The author has a close bond with his St. Bernard, Moose, and they've lived together since the dog was a puppy. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and Moose became protective, sitting by the author's feet when she's around. \n\nThe first issue was when Julia shouted at Moose to get out of the room when they were sleeping. The author tried to explain that changing the routine could stress the dog, but they compromised by leaving the door open. Then Julia started being mean in other ways: not giving treats, smacking the dog, making him sleep in the kitchen (which is cold), screaming at him when he barks, and showing jealousy. She also ignores Moose when he wants attention and feeds him less.\n\nThe author is frustrated and lists these issues. He's asked if he's in the wrong for wanting this to stop. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, consider the dog's well-being. The author has been the primary caregiver, and Moose has been well-behaved. Julia's actions include physical punishment (smacking) and withholding food, which are harmful. Since the author is the dog's owner, he has the right to set rules about how the dog is treated. Julia is a guest in his home, so her behavior there is her choice, but she's violating his boundaries by mistreating the dog.\n\nThe author tried to address the issues, like explaining the dog's needs and compromising, but Julia didn't listen. The fact that she's new to the dog and has her own dogs at home but still treats Moose poorly suggests her behavior is intentional and not just a lack of understanding. The author's concern for the dog's emotional state (like feeling guilty after being smacked) is valid. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset and wanting to stop Julia's mistreatment. He's protecting his pet, which is a common and responsible action. Julia's actions cross boundaries, especially since she's not the owner. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
