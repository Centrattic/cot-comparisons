He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how their girlfriend treats their dog. The situation involves the girlfriend's behavior towards the dog, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, the author has a strong bond with their dog, Moose, who is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has several negative interactions with the dog. She shouts at him, wants him off the sofa, smacks him, ignores him, and makes other demands that the author disagrees with. The author has tried to compromise but feels Julia's actions are harmful to Moose and their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the treatment of the pet and the dynamics in the relationship. The author is defending their dog's well-being and setting boundaries about how Moose should be treated. Julia's actions include physical punishment (smacking), not following the owner's wishes regarding the dog's care (feeding, sleeping arrangements), and showing jealousy, which is not a valid reason for mistreatment.\n\nThe user's perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong. To evaluate, consider whether the author has a right to be upset. Since the dog is the author's responsibility and Julia's actions could be harmful, the author is justified in addressing the issue. The author has tried to communicate and find compromises, which shows they're trying to resolve things amicably. Julia's behavior seems to be the problem here, not the author's reaction to it.\n\nPhysical punishment of animals is generally frowned upon and can be illegal in some places. The fact that Julia smacked the dog twice is a red flag. The author's concern for the dog's emotional well-being is valid, especially since dogs can sense and react to negative treatment.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's pets is important. If Julia can't respect the terms of care agreed upon by the owner, it's a significant issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address this because it's about the welfare of their pet and the health of their relationship. If Julia continues to mistreat Moose despite being asked, the author is within their rights to voice their concerns or reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
