He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong, with options A or B. The scenario involves a guy and his girlfriend who's treating his dog poorly. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author, let's call him Alex, is 21 and has a close bond with his St Bernard, Moose. He's been with his girlfriend Julia for four months, and they spend time at his place since she lives with her parents. The main issues are Julia's treatment of Moose, like shouting, not giving treats, smacking the dog, and keeping him in the kitchen. \n\nThe key points here are about how Julia's actions affect the dog and the relationship dynamics. Alex is upset because Julia is being mean to Moose, which he clearly values a lot. He's tried to compromise, like leaving the door open so Moose can come in, but Julia continues her behavior. She even smacks the dog, which Alex is against, and shows jealousy towards the dog. \n\nNow, considering animal welfare, smacking a dog for bad behavior is not recommended. Positive reinforcement is the standard advice, so smacking could be seen as abusive. Also, Julia not giving treats without Alex's input might be an issue if it affects the dog's health or training. \n\nAlex's feelings about Moose are valid if the dog is part of his family. He's the primary caregiver, so he probably has the right to set boundaries for how Moose is treated. Julia's jealousy might indicate deeper issues in their relationship, but that's separate from the dog's welfare. \n\nThe question is whether Alex is in the wrong for being angry at Julia's treatment of Moose. From the info given, it seems like Julia's actions are inappropriate, and Alex is standing up for his dog, which is a reasonable response. He's tried to communicate with her and find solutions, but she's not listening. That suggests he's doing the right thing by addressing the issues, so he's not in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No). The author is not in the wrong.\n"
