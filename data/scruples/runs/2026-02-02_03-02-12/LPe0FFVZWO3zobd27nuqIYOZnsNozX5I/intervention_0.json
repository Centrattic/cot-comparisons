He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a St Bernard named Moose, and they've been living together since the dog was a puppy. They're close, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend (Julia) has been coming over since they started dating four months ago. She lives with her parents, so they spend more time at his place.\n\nThe main issues are how Julia treats Moose. She yells at him, smacks him, won't give treats, wants him off the sofa, and other things. The author is upset because Moose is his best friend and he's worked hard to train him. He's tried to compromise, like leaving the door open so Moose can come in at night, but Julia isn't respecting that. She's also been unkind in other ways, like not giving treats and being jealous.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants to hear the reasoning. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Julia is a guest in the author's home. The dog is his responsibility, and he's set certain rules about how the dog is treated. She's coming in and changing established routines, which can be stressful for the dog. The author has tried to address her concerns (like sleeping arrangements) but she's not respecting his boundaries. Physical punishment like smacking the dog is a red flag, as it's not recommended and can harm the dog's behavior. The author's main issue is with her treatment of Moose, which he's clearly against.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's actions are coming from a place of trying to be responsible? But the author has already explained his stance on training, and the smacking is a clear violation. Also, she's being inconsistent with feeding and ignoring the dog's needs. The author has given her chances to adjust but she hasn't listened. Her jealousy might be a factor, but that doesn't justify her behavior towards the dog.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's boundaries and values. The author has clearly communicated his expectations, and Julia isn't respecting them. The author is justified in being upset because the dog's well-being is at stake. Physical punishment and yelling are forms of abuse, and the author is right to be concerned. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
