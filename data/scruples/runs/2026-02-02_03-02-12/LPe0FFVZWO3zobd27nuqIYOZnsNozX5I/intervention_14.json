He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation with their girlfriend and their dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved. They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend, Julia, has been over at the author's place a lot since she still lives with her parents. The main issue is how Julia treats Moose. The author is upset because Julia yells at the dog, doesn't give treats, hits him, and wants him to sleep in the kitchen. The author is frustrated and wants to know if they're in the wrong for being mad about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are the treatment of the dog. The author emphasizes Moose's good behavior and their bond. Julia's actions include shouting, smacking the dog, keeping him away from the room, and not giving him treats. The author has tried to compromise but feels Julia isn't respecting their dog's needs or their training methods.\n\nNow, considering animal welfare, hitting a dog is generally not acceptable. Positive reinforcement is the standard these days, and physical punishment can lead to fear and aggression. Julia's hitting the dog is a red flag. Also, yelling and isolating the dog in a cold kitchen could be stressful for the animal. The author is responsible for Moose's care, so others should respect that unless there's a valid reason (like the dog being dangerous, which isn't mentioned here).\n\nJulia's jealousy of the attention the dog gets might also be a factor here, but that doesn't justify mistreatment. The author is trying to balance their relationship with their responsibility to their pet. The fact that Julia doesn't live there means she should follow the house rules set by the author. She's not in a position to make decisions about the dog's care unless she's a co-owner, which she isn't.\n\nThe author has tried to address the issues but hasn't seen improvement. They feel their bond with Moose is being disrupted. It's reasonable for them to be upset about their partner mistreating their pet, especially since the dog is a significant part of their life.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. Julia's actions are concerning and the author is justified in wanting to address them. The answer should be B.\n"
