He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author's girlfriend treating his dog poorly. The author is upset because his girlfriend is shouting at the dog, smacking him, not giving treats, etc. The main question is whether the author is wrong to be angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a strong bond with his dog, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend is acting in ways that the author finds unacceptable, like physical punishment and not following agreed routines. The author has tried to compromise but the girlfriend isn't listening.\n\nNow, the possible angles. The girlfriend might feel that she's not part of the household and might not agree with the dog's presence in certain areas. But the author is the one who owns the dog and has lived with him. The girlfriend's actions, like smacking the dog and shouting, are concerning. The author is protective of his pet, which is understandable. \n\nIs there any cultural or social norms to consider? In many places, animal cruelty is taken seriously. Smacking a dog, even if not to the point of legal cruelty, is often considered abusive in training methods. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid. \n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy could be a factor, but that doesn't excuse her behavior. The author's role is to protect his pet, and if the girlfriend is causing harm, he has the right to address it. The compromises mentioned (like leaving the door open) might not have worked, leading to ongoing issues.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics. The girlfriend is a guest in the author's home. She might not understand the bond between the author and the dog, but respecting the host's rules is important. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries for his pet's treatment. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't wrong. The girlfriend's actions are harmful, and he's justified in wanting her to stop. The answer should be B (No).\n"
