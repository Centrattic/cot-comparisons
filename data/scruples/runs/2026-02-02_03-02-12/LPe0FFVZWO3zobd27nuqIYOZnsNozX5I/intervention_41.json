He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details straight.\n\nSo, the author is 21 and has a St Bernard named Moose, who he's had for three months. They're really close, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23, and they've been together four months. She lives with her parents, so they spend more time at his place. From the start, Moose seems protective of him when Julia is around, which the author is okay with. But when Julia starts sleeping over, she yells at Moose to get out of the room, which upsets the author. He explains that shouting could throw Moose off because he's not used to it. They compromise by leaving the door open.\n\nThen Julia starts being mean to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, refuses to give treats (even though he doesn't live there), ignores him when he comes for affection, wants him in the kitchen (which is cold), smacks him twice, says she's jealous, calls him annoying even though she has three big dogs at home, screams at him when he barks, and feeds him less. The author lists all these points and is considering telling her to stop, but he's already told her to ignore Moose if she's going to be mean, which she's not listening to.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know the assistant's take. Answer A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The key points here are about how Julia is treating the dog and the author's reaction. The author has clear boundaries about how his dog should be treated. Moose is his responsibility, and he's been raising him, so he has a right to set rules for the dog's treatment. Julia's actions\u2014shouting, hitting, not feeding properly, and being unaffectionate\u2014could be harmful to the dog's well-being and the author's relationship with Moose.\n\nJulia's behavior seems disrespectful towards the author's wishes and the dog's needs. The author tried to compromise initially but Julia continued with the problematic actions. The author's concern for the dog's well-being is valid. It's his dog, so he has the right to decide how the dog is treated, even if Julia is a guest in his home.\n\nHowever, the author did try to address the issues by compromising and talking to her. If Julia is not respecting his boundaries after being asked, then it's reasonable for the author to be upset and consider ending the relationship if it can't be resolved. The author isn't being unreasonable here; he's protecting his pet, which is his responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have set clearer boundaries from the start. But given that Julia is his girlfriend, it's expected that they communicate openly. The fact that she's being jealous and taking it out on the dog is a problem. The smacking and yelling are especially concerning because they could harm the dog's behavior and trust.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners respect each other's values and boundaries. If Julia can't respect the author's care for his dog, that's a red flag. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his dog and his own feelings about how the dog is treated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
