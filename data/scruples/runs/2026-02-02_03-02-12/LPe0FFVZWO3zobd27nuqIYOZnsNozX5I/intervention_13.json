He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog, Moose. The situation involves the girlfriend, Julia, and her interactions with Moose.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the specific actions Julia is taking. The author lists several points: not giving treats, ignoring the dog, wanting him in the kitchen (which is cold), smacking the dog twice, saying she's jealous, calling him annoying despite having other dogs, yelling at barking, and feeding him less. The author is a 21-year-old who lives with Moose and has a close bond with him. Julia is 23 and still lives with her parents, so they spend time at his place more often.\n\nThe key issues here are about how the dog is being treated. The author is clearly the dog's owner, so he's responsible for the dog's care and well-being. Julia's actions\u2014like hitting the dog, yelling, not following the agreed-upon compromise, and not giving treats\u2014could be seen as mistreatment. The author is concerned about the dog's emotional state and routine, which is valid because sudden changes or harsh treatment can stress the animal. \n\nNow, considering the relationship dynamics, the author has tried to compromise, like letting the door open so Moose can come back in. However, Julia is not adhering to these agreements and is acting out in ways that the author finds unacceptable. The author is in a position where he's trying to balance the relationship with his commitment to his dog's well-being. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. From an ethical standpoint, mistreatment of a pet is a serious issue. If the girlfriend is indeed smacking the dog, yelling at it, and not feeding it properly, that crosses into cruelty. The author, as the owner, has the right to be upset and to set boundaries to protect his pet. \n\nPotential counterarguments might be that Julia is new to the situation and not used to Moose, so she's reacting out of stress or jealousy. However, the author has tried to educate her and find compromises, and her actions are escalating. The fact that she smacked the dog twice is a red flag, as physical punishment is generally discouraged in dog training and can lead to fear or aggression in dogs. \n\nAlso, the author's main concern is the well-being of his dog, which is a valid priority. If Julia can't respect the dog's needs and the owner's wishes, it might indicate a deeper issue in the relationship. The author is not in the wrong for standing up for his pet, especially since he's the one responsible for the dog's care. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The main issue here is Julia's treatment of the dog, not the author's reaction to it.\n"
