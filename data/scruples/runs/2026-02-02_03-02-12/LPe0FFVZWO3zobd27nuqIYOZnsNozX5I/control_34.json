He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with how their girlfriend treats their dog. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old guy, has a St Bernard named Moose. He's been living with Moose alone since getting him, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23, and they've been together four months. She lives with her parents, so they spend more time at his place. Moose is protective around her, which is normal behavior. \n\nThe main issues start when Julia starts sleeping over. She yells at Moose to get out of the room, which the author didn't like because it could stress the dog. They compromise by leaving the door open. But then Julia continues to be harsh towards Moose. She doesn't give him treats when asked, ignores him, wants him in the cold kitchen, smacks him twice, is jealous of the attention given to Moose, calls him annoying despite having big dogs at her parents' house, screams at him when he barks, and feeds him less food. The author is considering confronting her about these issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dog is the author's pet, and he's responsible for Moose's well-being. Julia is a guest in his home, so she's there as part of their relationship. The author is protective of his pet, which makes sense since Moose is his companion. However, Julia's behavior seems quite harsh. \n\nSmacking the dog twice is physical punishment, which is generally not advised for training dogs. It's possible that Julia didn't know that this method is discouraged. The author might have explained this to her, but she still did it. Not giving treats when asked could be a point of contention. Also, moving the dog to a cold kitchen could be harmful, especially if the dog isn't used to that environment. \n\nThe author tried to find a compromise with the sleeping arrangement, but Julia wasn't cooperative. The jealousy aspect suggests that there's an emotional component here. Julia might feel insecure about the amount of attention the dog gets, which could be a red flag in the relationship. \n\nHowever, the author is the primary caregiver, so he has the right to set boundaries about how his pet is treated. If Julia is not respecting those boundaries, especially after being asked, then it's reasonable for the author to be upset. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's some misunderstanding. For example, Julia might not realize that her actions are inappropriate. But the author has made his expectations clear. When she continues to ignore them, that's a problem. \n\nPhysical punishment is a key issue here. Smacking the dog is a clear sign of mistreatment, and the author is right to be against it. The fact that Julia does this despite knowing the author's stance shows she's not respecting his views. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If Julia can't respect the author's treatment of his pet, that might be a bigger issue. The author is not wrong to be upset about his dog being mistreated in his home. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Julia's actions are the problem here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
