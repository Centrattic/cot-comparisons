He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who's upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author, a 21-year-old guy, has a close bond with his St Bernard, Moose, who is 3 months old. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23 and they've been together four months. She stays at his place more often now. The issues start when Julia starts sleeping over. She doesn't want Moose in the room, shouts at him, wants him off the sofas, won't give treats, smacked the dog twice, and other things like feeding him less.\n\nThe main points of contention are her treatment towards the dog. The author is protective of Moose and feels Julia's actions are harmful and disrespectful. He's trying to compromise but she's not cooperating. He lists eight specific complaints.\n\nNow, considering typical relationship dynamics, the author's perspective is that Julia is treating the dog poorly, which is affecting their relationship. From Julia's side, maybe she feels overwhelmed, maybe she's not used to having a dog, or perhaps she's jealous of the attention the dog gets. However, slapping the dog and shouting are clear signs of improper treatment. Dogs don't understand screaming or physical punishment like that; positive reinforcement is standard advice. \n\nThe author is firm about his dog's care and is trying to set boundaries. Julia is not respecting those boundaries and is acting in ways that could be harmful. The fact that the author has had Moose since he was 3 months old and they have a strong bond suggests that Moose is a significant part of his life. It's reasonable for him to be concerned about Julia's treatment.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that the author is overreacting, that Julia is just trying to adjust to living with a dog, or that the girlfriend's actions aren't that bad. However, the specific actions like smacking the dog and yelling are problematic. Also, the dog's well-being is at stake, and the author is the primary caregiver. It's his responsibility to ensure the dog is treated well, and if Julia isn't respecting that, the author is justified in addressing it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Julia's actions are the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
