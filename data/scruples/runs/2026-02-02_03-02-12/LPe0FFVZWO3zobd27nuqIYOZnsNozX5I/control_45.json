He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The user is asking if he's at fault for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author has a close bond with his dog, who's well-behaved. He's living alone with Moose, and the girlfriend has been coming over a lot. The girlfriend doesn't like the dog sleeping in the same room, shouted at him, smacked him, doesn't give treats, and has other negative behaviors.\n\nThe author is frustrated because the girlfriend isn't respecting his bond with Moose and is treating the dog poorly. He's tried to compromise, but she's continued to have a bad attitude. The key points are about the treatment of the dog, the compromises made, and the girlfriend's jealousy.\n\nNow, considering animal welfare, smacking the dog is definitely not okay. The author is against that, which is correct. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as cruel, even if she's not a dog owner herself. The author's stance is to protect his pet, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's jealousy might be an issue, but that's between them. However, the main issue here is the mistreatment of the dog.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, the author is standing up for his pet, which is part of his household. The girlfriend isn't a resident, so her demands about how the dog is treated might not be reasonable. The author has the right to set boundaries about how his pet is treated in his home. The girlfriend's behavior is causing stress to the dog, which is a valid reason for the author to be upset.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, and the author is justified in being angry and seeking to stop the mistreatment. The answer should be B.\n"
