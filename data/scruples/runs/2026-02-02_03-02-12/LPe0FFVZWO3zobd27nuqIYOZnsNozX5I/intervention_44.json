He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about how his girlfriend treats his dog. \n\nFirst, the author has a strong bond with his dog, Moose. He's been the main caregiver, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, is new to their lives and lives with her parents. They spend more time at the author's place. \n\nNow, the issues start when Julia comes over. Moose is protective, which is normal for a St Bernard. The first problem is Julia yelling at Moose to get out of the room when they sleep. The author is upset because shouting can stress the dog and disrupt his routine. They compromise by leaving the door open, but the problems persist.\n\nThen Julia starts being \"nasty\" to Moose. She doesn't give treats when asked, ignores him, wants him in the cold kitchen, smacks him, expresses jealousy, calls him annoying despite having three big dogs at home, screams at him for barking, and feeds him less. The author stops letting her feed Moose because he doesn't want the dog to eat less.\n\nThe author is firm about his stance on how Moose should be treated. He's communicated his concerns but feels Julia isn't listening. The key points are the physical smacking, shouting, and not adhering to the agreed compromise. The author's main concern is Moose's well-being and consistent care, which is valid. \n\nFrom a dog training perspective, physical punishment is generally discouraged. It can lead to fear and anxiety in dogs. The fact that Moose becomes sad when he feels guilty after being hit shows negative emotional impact. Julia's jealousy and inconsistency in treating Moose (like not giving treats unless she wants) also reflect poorly on her behavior.\n\nThe author is in a position where he's responsible for Moose's care. If Julia's actions are harming the dog or creating stress, he's justified in addressing it. The fact that he's tried to communicate and set boundaries but she continues the behavior suggests that the problem lies with Julia, not the author. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset and wanting to address the situation. Julia's actions are the main issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
