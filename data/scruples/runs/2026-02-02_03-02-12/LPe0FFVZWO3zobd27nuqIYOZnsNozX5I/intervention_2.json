He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is upset because his girlfriend treats his dog poorly. The key points here are about the treatment of the dog and the girlfriend's behavior towards it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Moose is a well-behaved dog and they have a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and Moose became protective, which is normal for some dogs. The author is okay with Moose's behavior but Julia is upset. The first issue is Julia shouting at Moose to get out of the room. The author thought this was harsh and could be confusing for the dog. They compromised by leaving the door open, but the problems continued.\n\nThen Julia starts other behaviors: not giving treats, ignoring Moose, wanting him in the cold kitchen, smacking him twice, expressing jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming when he barks. The author lists these as 8 issues and is considering ending things if she doesn't stop.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me consider the other perspective. Julia is a guest in the author's home. She's not living there, so she shouldn't have the final say on how the dog is treated. The author is the dog's owner and responsible for his care. If Julia is acting in ways that are harmful or stressful to the dog, like smacking him or isolating him in a cold room, that's a problem. Physical punishment is generally discouraged in dog training, so smacking is a red flag. Also, the author's compromise was to leave the door open, but she didn't follow through on that agreement. \n\nJulia's jealousy might be a personal issue, but that doesn't justify mistreating the dog. The author's main concern is the dog's well-being. Since the dog is his and he's the one responsible for its care, he has the right to set boundaries on how others interact with his pet. The actions Julia is taking could be harmful and the author is correct in wanting to address this. \n\nIs there a chance the author is overreacting? Maybe if Julia's actions were minor, but the smacking and isolation in a cold room are significant. Also, the dog's behavior (being protective) is natural, and yelling might not help. The author is trying to mediate and find a compromise, but Julia isn't respecting his decisions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his dog's treatment. The answer should be B (No).\n"
