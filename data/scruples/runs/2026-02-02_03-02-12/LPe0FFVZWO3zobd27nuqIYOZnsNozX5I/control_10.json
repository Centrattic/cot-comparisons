He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe guy, 21, has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved. He's been living alone with Moose since getting him. His girlfriend, Julia, 23, has been over a lot because she lives with her parents. Initially, Moose was protective of him around her. The first issue was when Julia yelled at Moose to get out of the room when they were sleeping. He compromised by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued being harsh towards Moose: not giving treats, ignoring him, wanting him in the cold kitchen, smacking him, being jealous, calling him annoying despite having big dogs at her parents, screaming at him for barking, feeding him less.\n\nThe author is upset and considering telling Julia to stop. The question is, is he in the wrong?\n\nSo, Julia is visiting his home, where Moose lives. He's the dog's owner. Julia's actions\u2014yelling, smacking, not giving treats, isolating the dog in cold\u2014are all things that could be seen as mistreatment. The author has tried to compromise but Julia isn't respecting the dog's established routine and care. The author is defending his dog's well-being, which is his responsibility as the owner. Julia's jealousy and the way she's handling the dog might be crossing boundaries. Since she's a guest, her behavior should align with his rules. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect his pet. So the answer is B.\n"
