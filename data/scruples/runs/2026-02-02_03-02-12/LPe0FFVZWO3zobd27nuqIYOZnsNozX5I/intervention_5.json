He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend's treatment of their dog, Moose.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a close bond with Moose, who's well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over more, and Moose is protective, sitting by the author's feet. When Julia sleeps over, she made Moose leave the room, shouting at him. They compromised with leaving the door open. But then Julia continued being harsh: not giving treats, smacking him, keeping him in a cold kitchen, screaming at him when he barks, and expressing jealousy over the affection given to Moose.\n\nThe author is upset about this treatment and is considering confronting Julia. They've already told Julia to ignore the dog if she's going to be mean, but she didn't listen. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and asks for confirmation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is how Julia treats the dog. The author is the owner and is responsible for Moose's well-being. Julia's actions include physical punishment (smacking), emotional neglect (ignoring him, screaming), and not following the owner's instructions (like feeding less). These actions could be harmful to the dog's behavior and mental health. The author is concerned about their dog's welfare and is trying to set boundaries with Julia. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's pets is important. If one partner is mistreating the pet, especially the owner's pet, that's a valid concern. The author is taking steps to address the issue, first through compromise and then by setting more direct boundaries. Since Julia isn't listening and the actions are harmful, the author isn't being unreasonable. It's reasonable to expect a partner to respect the other's pets, especially when those pets are part of the household where the owner lives.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Julia's actions are problematic, and the author is justified in being upset and addressing the situation.\n"
