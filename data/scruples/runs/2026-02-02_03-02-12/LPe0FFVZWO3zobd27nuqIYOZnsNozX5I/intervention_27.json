He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their girlfriend's treatment of their dog, Moose.\n\nFirst, the author has a close bond with Moose, who's well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and Moose became protective. That makes sense; dogs can be protective of their owners. But then Julia's behavior toward Moose became an issue. She shouted at him, wanted him out of the room, smacked him twice, and other things like not giving treats, ignoring him, etc. The author is clearly frustrated because Moose is part of their family and Julia's actions are affecting the dog negatively.\n\nThe author tried to compromise by leaving the door open, but Julia continued the negative behavior. The key points here are that Julia is a guest in the author's home, so she doesn't live there. The author has the right to set boundaries about how their pet is treated in their own house. The fact that Julia is smacking the dog is a red line. Physical punishment can harm the dog's trust and well-being. Also, the author is concerned about Moose's emotional state, which is valid.\n\nJulia's jealousy is mentioned, but that doesn't justify her actions. It's the author's responsibility to ensure their pet is treated kindly. The author has tried to communicate and make compromises, but Julia isn't respecting those boundaries. So, the author is justified in being upset and taking action to protect Moose.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
