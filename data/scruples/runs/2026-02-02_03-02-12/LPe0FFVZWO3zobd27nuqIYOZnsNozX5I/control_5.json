He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend's treatment of the author's dog. The author is upset because the girlfriend is being harsh and not following the compromises they made.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's dog, Moose, is well-behaved and they have a close bond. When the girlfriend starts spending time at the author's place, Moose shows protectiveness, which is normal for some dogs. The girlfriend's reactions include yelling, moving the dog out of the room, not giving treats, and even smacking the dog. The author finds this unacceptable and is considering confronting her.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the girlfriend is mistreating Moose in several ways. The user wants to know if the author is at fault. The answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI should consider the girlfriend's actions. Yelling at the dog, smacking it, not following agreed-upon rules like giving treats, ignoring the dog when the author asks, and keeping the dog in a cold kitchen. These actions are negative. The author has tried compromising, like leaving the door open, but the girlfriend continues her behavior. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and their bond with Moose.\n\nThe girlfriend's justification includes jealousy and concerns about the dog's size. However, smacking the dog is a clear form of punishment that the author disagrees with. The author has taken steps to prevent the girlfriend from feeding the dog because of her feeding habits. The girlfriend's actions are affecting the dog's behavior (e.g., being sad when feeling guilty). \n\nFrom an animal welfare standpoint, physical punishment like smacking is not recommended. Yelling can also stress the dog. The author's stance is that the dog should be treated kindly, and the girlfriend is not respecting that. Since the author has communicated their concerns and the girlfriend hasn't changed her behavior despite compromises, the author is justified in being upset. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their pet's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
