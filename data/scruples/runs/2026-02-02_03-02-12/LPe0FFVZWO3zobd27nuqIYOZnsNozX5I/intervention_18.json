He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend and their dog. The author is upset because their girlfriend treats the dog poorly. The girlfriend has a list of issues like not giving treats, smacking the dog, making the dog sleep in a cold kitchen, etc. The author has tried to compromise but is now considering ending the relationship over this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the girlfriend's actions and the author's response. The girlfriend is smacking the dog, which is a form of physical punishment. The author owns the dog, so others shouldn't be physically punishing it without their consent. Also, the girlfriend is not following the owner's rules about treating the dog, despite being told. The author has given some leeway, like allowing the dog on the sofa, but the girlfriend is overstepping.\n\nThe author is standing up for their dog's well-being. Since the dog is a pet and a family member for the author, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the owner's wishes and harmful to the dog. The author has tried to reason and compromise but the girlfriend isn't listening. The list of grievances is significant, and physical punishment is a red flag.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. If the girlfriend can't respect the author's pet, that's a major issue. The author isn't overreacting if the dog's welfare is at stake. The girlfriend's jealousy and negative behavior towards the dog might indicate deeper issues in the relationship. The author's decision to set boundaries is justified here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They are protecting their pet and addressing the girlfriend's disrespectful behavior. The correct answer should be B.\n"
