He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. The key points here are the actions of the girlfriend towards the dog and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the dog, Moose, is well-behaved and has a strong bond with the author. The girlfriend starts by being protective of the author when she's around, which is normal. However, once she starts sleeping over, she becomes aggressive towards the dog. She shouts, wants him out of the room, won't give treats, hits him, and isolates him. These actions are harmful and show a lack of respect for the dog's well-being.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise by keeping the door open, but the girlfriend continues her negative behavior. The author has expressed his concerns but she doesn't listen. The list of grievances includes physical punishment, emotional neglect, and disregarding the dog's needs. Physical punishment like smacking is particularly concerning as it can traumatize the dog.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is mentioned, but that doesn't justify her treatment of the dog. The author is maintaining his dog's welfare, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's actions are affecting the dog's behavior and their relationship. The author's frustration is understandable because he's trying to protect his pet, which is a significant part of his life.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If one partner's actions are harming the other's pets, it's a serious issue. The author is standing up for his dog's treatment, which is justified. The girlfriend's behavior indicates she may not respect the dog or the author's feelings about him. The author isn't wrong for being upset; he's advocating for his pet. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
