He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding how their girlfriend treats their dog. The author's main points are about the girlfriend's behavior towards Moose, their dog. The author feels that Julia is being harsh and not respecting the dog's routine and their bond with Moose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key issues here. The girlfriend is shouting at the dog, not giving treats when asked, smacking the dog, and trying to change where the dog sleeps. The author is clearly protective of Moose and has set these boundaries. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have her own opinions about how the dog should be treated, which conflicts with the author's preferences.\n\nThe author is in a new relationship, four months in, and the girlfriend still lives with her parents. The dynamics here might involve her adjusting to the dog's presence, but the author is the owner, so he has the final say on how the dog is treated. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like hitting the dog, ignoring him when he seeks affection, and not following the author's wishes\u2014could be seen as crossing boundaries. The fact that the author has tried to compromise (like leaving the door open) but the girlfriend continues to act in ways he doesn't agree with suggests that she's not respecting his boundaries.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy of the affection given to the dog might be a contributing factor, but that doesn't justify her mistreatment. The author's argument is that he's affectionate with her as well, so her jealousy isn't a valid reason. Also, the smacking of the dog is a red flag, as the author is against physical punishment. The dog's behavior (being sad, showing guilt) indicates distress, which the author is concerned about.\n\nThe user's perspective is that the author is not in the wrong. The key points here are the ownership of the dog, the boundaries set by the owner, and the girlfriend's actions that violate those boundaries. The author is protecting his pet's well-being, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's actions are not acceptable, and the author is rightfully upset. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
