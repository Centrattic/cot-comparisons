He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a 21-year-old guy who has a close relationship with his dog, Moose. He's been with his girlfriend for four months, and she spends time at his place since she lives with her parents. The main issues are how the girlfriend treats the dog.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially shouted at the dog when he was in the room. Then there's a list of grievances: not giving treats, ignoring him, wanting him in the kitchen, smacking him, jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming when he barks, and feeding him less. The author feels his dog is being treated poorly and is upset about it.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the dog is part of his family, and he's protective. The girlfriend might see the dog as a separate entity, maybe not understanding the bond. However, some actions by her could be problematic. For example, smacking the dog is a form of physical punishment which is generally discouraged in modern dog training. Shouting can also be stressful for a dog. Plus, the author has a right to be concerned about his dog's well-being.\n\nBut the girlfriend is new to the dog, and maybe she's not aware of the best ways to interact with him. However, she continues to act in ways that the author finds harmful. The author tried to compromise, like leaving the door open so the dog could come in. But her actions are escalating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the description, the author is trying to stand up for his dog's treatment. The girlfriend's actions seem to be violating his boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable; he's concerned about his dog's welfare. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. The key point is that the girlfriend is mistreating the dog, and the author is justified in addressing it.\n"
