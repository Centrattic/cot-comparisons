He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a close relationship with his dog, Moose. He's been living with Moose alone until his girlfriend came into the picture. The girlfriend, Julia, has started treating Moose in ways that the author disagrees with. She yells at the dog, won't give him treats, smacks him, wants him to sleep in the kitchen, etc. The author is upset and considering confronting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the treatment of the dog. The author is against physical punishment (smacking) and believes Julia is being cruel or inconsiderate. The dog is well-behaved and has been trained by the author. Julia's actions are causing stress to the dog and the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my opinion. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, mistreatment of animals is generally not acceptable. Smacking a dog as punishment is considered cruel by many and can lead to fear or aggression. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, which is valid. Julia's jealousy about the affection the dog receives might also be a red flag, but that's more about the relationship dynamics. \n\nHowever, the author is the owner of the dog, so he has the right to set boundaries on how the dog is treated in his home. If Julia is not respecting his rules (like not giving treats, feeding the dog less, or physically punishing the dog), then the author has a right to be upset. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has trained the dog and established a routine. Sudden changes by Julia could disrupt the dog's behavior. The author's compromise about the door being open shows he's trying to accommodate Julia but she's not following through. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's anger is justified because Julia is violating his rules and mistreating his pet. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
