He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how their girlfriend treats their dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a close bond with their St Bernard, Moose. The dog is well-behaved, which is clear. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over more, and there are several issues listed. The main points are that Julia yells at Moose, wants him off the sofa, smacks him, ignores him when he seeks affection, and other things like feeding him less. The author is frustrated because Moose is their best friend and Julia's actions are affecting their relationship with the dog.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that they're not, which I need to evaluate. From a typical perspective, pet ownership responsibilities include properly caring for the animal. If the girlfriend is not following the owner's guidelines and is using harmful methods (like smacking), that's definitely problematic. The author is concerned about Moose's well-being and the bond they share. \n\nJulia's actions\u2014yelling, physical punishment, ignoring the dog's needs\u2014could be considered abusive or neglectful. The author has a right to be upset if their partner is mistreating their pet. The fact that the author has tried to compromise but Julia continues to act this way shows that the author is trying to address the issues. The list of grievances includes things like not giving treats when asked, which the author has requested she do. \n\nHowever, there might be a nuance if Julia is genuinely concerned about the dog's size or other factors, but her methods (yelling, hitting) are inappropriate. The author's ownership means they have the right to set boundaries on how the dog is treated. Since Julia isn't the owner, her actions without the owner's consent are a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their pet and their relationship with him. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are that the author is defending their pet's well-being and has communicated their concerns, while Julia is acting against the owner's wishes and using harmful methods.\n"
