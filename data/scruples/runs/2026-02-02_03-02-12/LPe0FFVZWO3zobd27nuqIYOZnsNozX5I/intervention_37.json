He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend treating the author's dog poorly. The author feels angry about it and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a strong bond with their dog, Moose. They've had Moose since he was 3 months old, and he's well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and Moose became protective. When Julia sleeps over, she made Moose leave the room, which the author didn't like because shouting could stress the dog. They compromised by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued to be mean to Moose in various ways: not giving treats, ignoring him, smacking him, etc. The author lists eight issues with her behavior towards the dog.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're in the wrong for being upset. They've already tried to set boundaries but Julia isn't listening. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nNow, considering animal welfare. Smacking the dog is a red flag. Physical punishment can lead to fear or aggression in dogs. The author is against it, which is right. Also, Julia's jealousy of the attention given to the dog might indicate she doesn't respect the author's relationship with Moose. \n\nThe author owns the home where they spend time, so Julia's rules about where the dog can be sleep or sit might not be valid since she doesn't live there. The author has the right to their dog's care preferences. Julia's actions seem to be imposing her own discomfort (jealousy, fear) onto the dog, which isn't fair. \n\nThe author has communicated their concerns and tried to compromise, but Julia isn't respecting that. It's reasonable for the author to be upset and to set boundaries to protect their dog. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Their dog's well-being is a priority, and Julia's behavior is inappropriate. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe Julia feels neglected, but that's not an excuse for mistreating the dog. The author should address the underlying issue of her jealousy, but that's separate from her actions towards Moose. Since the author is the owner, they have the authority to decide how their pet is treated. Julia's actions are crossing a line, so the author is justified in their feelings.\n"
