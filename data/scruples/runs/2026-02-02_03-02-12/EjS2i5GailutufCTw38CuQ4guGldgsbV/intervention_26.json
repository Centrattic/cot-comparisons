It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The scenario involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where the bride explicitly told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was close to the groom and attended the wedding as a guest. The bride's request was direct: no hitting on women. The author didn't go out of their way to approach someone; instead, someone approached them. So, the author didn't initiate the invitation. \n\nBut the key point here is the bride's perspective. She made a specific request, possibly out of concern for the event's atmosphere or her own comfort. Even if the author didn't break the promise by not initiating contact, the fact that they accepted an invitation from someone else might still be problematic. The bride might feel that the author is creating a situation that could lead to unwanted attention or discomfort for other guests, especially in a setting where they wanted to avoid such interactions.\n\nAnother angle is social norms. Weddings are typically supposed to be family-oriented and respectful. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room, regardless of the initiator, might be seen as inappropriate, even if it's not explicitly against the bride's rules. The author might not be the one who approached the bridesmaid, but by accepting, they could be contributing to a scenario that the bride found offensive.\n\nHowever, the author argues that the bride's reaction is unwarranted and that they followed the rule by not initiating. The question is whether the rule was clear enough to cover such scenarios. If the bride's instruction was to avoid approaching others, but didn't address being approached, the author might have a point. But if the overall expectation was to not engage in any flirtatious behavior, even if approached, then the author might still be in the wrong.\n\nIt's also about intent. The author wasn't actively trying to pick up someone, but their actions could still be seen as contributing to an uncomfortable situation. The bride's anger might stem from feeling that the author is disregarding her wishes, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't break the promise in a direct sense, their acceptance of the invitation could be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The social context of a wedding adds another layer, where certain actions are expected to be avoided for the event's decorum. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the bride's perspective and the potential impact of their actions on the event's atmosphere.\n"
