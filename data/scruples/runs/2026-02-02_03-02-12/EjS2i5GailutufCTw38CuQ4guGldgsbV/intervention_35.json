      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at his ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told by the bride not to hit on any women, but he ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. He's wondering if he's an asshole (AITA) for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at his ex's wedding, which he's close with the groom and family. The bride had explicitly told him not to hit on women, which he agreed to. However, he ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid. The key points here are: Did he actively solicit the attention, or was it the other way around? He claims he didn't go out of his way to pick up anyone, just enjoyed the party. The bridesmaid approached him. \n\nThe bride is upset, but the author argues that he didn't break his promise because it was the woman who initiated the interaction. So the main issue is whether the author's actions were a breach of the agreement with the bride. If the bride told him not to hit on women, and he didn't do that but accepted an invitation from someone else, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the bride's rule was to avoid any romantic interactions, even accepting an invitation could be seen as crossing a line, even if initiated by the other person. \n\nAnother angle: social norms. Even if the bride didn't explicitly say not to accept invitations, maybe there's an unspoken expectation at a wedding to behave respectfully, especially when a former partner is present. The author's presence might be sensitive, and his actions could be perceived as disrespectful to the bride, regardless of who approached whom. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might feel uncomfortable or that the author isn't being considerate of her feelings. The author might not see it that way, but the bride's perspective is important here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the key issue is that he didn't actively solicit the interaction, but accepted an invitation, maybe he's not at fault. However, if the bride felt that just being approached and accepting an invitation is a violation of her boundaries, then he might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes, even if he didn't initiate it. The line here is blurry. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the answer hinges on respecting others' boundaries. The author agreed not to hit on women, but the bridesmaid's invitation might be seen as a form of flirting or hitting on. If the author didn't actively seek it out but accepted, maybe it's not his fault. However, if he could have reasonably refused to avoid causing the bride distress, that might place some responsibility on him. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were considered hitting on women as per the bride's definition. If the bride saw any interaction as crossing a line, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the author didn't actively pursue it and just accepted an invitation, he might not be. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, and I can see that. But there's also the argument that he should have been more considerate of the bride's feelings regardless of who initiated. \n\nHmm. So considering all that, maybe the answer is B (No), but I'm a bit torn. Some might argue he should have turned her down to respect the bride's wishes. Others might say he's not at fault because he didn't initiate it. The key is whether the author's actions violated the agreement he made with the bride. If the bride said not to hit on women, and the author didn't do that but accepted an invitation from someone else, he didn't break the promise. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
