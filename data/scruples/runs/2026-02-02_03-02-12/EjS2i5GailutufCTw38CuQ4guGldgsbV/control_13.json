It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. So, the user is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the user was invited to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride (soon to be bride) directly told the user not to hit on any women at the wedding. The user thought that was a strange demand but agreed. At the wedding, they were having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset. The user is confused because they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the user was warned not to hit on anyone, even though that might be an unusual request. They didn't go out of their way to approach someone, but when a bridesmaid approached them, they accepted the invitation. The user is arguing that they didn't break their promise because the girl came to them. \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. Weddings are supposed to be happy events, and the bride might be sensitive about her wedding day. Even if the user wasn't the one approaching, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the bride had already expressed her boundaries. The user is in a position where they're at their ex's wedding, which might already be a touchy subject. \n\nEven if the user didn't initiate, by accepting the invitation, they're possibly disrespecting the bride's wishes. The fact that the bride is upset suggests that she felt those boundaries were crossed. The user might not have intended harm, but the action still caused hurt. So, maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's explicit request, even if it was a mutual decision between them and the bridesmaid. \n\nAnother angle: the user was in a social setting where respecting the host's (the bride's) wishes is important. Even if the invitation was mutual, the context of the wedding and the prior warning makes the situation more delicate. The user could have chosen to decline the invitation to avoid making the bride uncomfortable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries despite being explicitly told not to hit on anyone. Even if they didn't initiate, accepting the invitation still went against the bride's wishes, leading to her being upset.\n"
