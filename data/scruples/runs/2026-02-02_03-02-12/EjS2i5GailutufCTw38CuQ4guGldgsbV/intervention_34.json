It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women before the wedding. At the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he agreed. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author didn't go out of their way to hit on people; they were just having fun. The bride made a direct request, but the author felt it was unnecessary. The key point here is whether the author broke the promise. The author claims they didn't initiate; the bridesmaid invited them. So technically, maybe they didn't break the rule. But maybe the bride's request was to prevent any flirting, not just initiating contact. If the author accepted the invitation, even if it wasn't their fault, it might still make the bride uncomfortable. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is wrong. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, just went along with the invitation without being pushy. The bride's reaction might be over the top, but the author's actions were consensual between two adults. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that they should have respected the bride's boundaries even if it wasn't their fault. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author didn't actively seek anyone out and the invitation was from the bridesmaid, it's more the bridesmaid's choice. So the answer is probably B.\n"
