It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The author went to a wedding where the bride is their ex. They were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on women, which the author found odd. At the wedding, they were socializing, drinking, and dancing. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe author argues they didn't go out of their way to pick up anyone. The invitation was from the bridesmaid, not the author approaching someone. Also, they didn't break the agreed-upon \"promise\" because the bride initiated the contact. \n\nThe key points here are about consent and expectations. The bride set a boundary beforehand, and the author respected it in the sense that they didn't actively seek out others. However, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might be seen as crossing the line, depending on the bride's perspective. The problem is that the author didn't consider the bride's feelings even after she expressed discomfort. Even if the invitation wasn't solicited, being in a position where someone else is trying to engage in a romantic or intimate context at a wedding (especially an ex's wedding) could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle is social norms. Weddings are generally not the place to pursue romantic interests, regardless of past relationships. The fact that the author is an ex might make it more sensitive. The bride might feel that their presence is undermining the wedding's significance or that they're showing disrespect. \n\nBut the author didn't explicitly agree to avoid all interactions. The bride's rule was about hitting on women, and the author claims they didn't do that. They were approached instead. There's a nuance here between actively seeking someone out versus accepting an invitation. If the author had no prior intent and the interaction was spontaneous, maybe they're not at fault. However, the outcome is that the bride is upset, and causing someone distress, even if unintentionally, can be considered wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether accepting the invitation could be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. Even if the author didn't actively seek the interaction, the situation could still be perceived as inappropriate given the context. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a valid reason the bride is upset.\n"
