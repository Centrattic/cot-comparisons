It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding, not turning down a girl who invited him to her hotel room, and the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the writer went to the wedding because they're close to the groom. The bride told him not to hit on anyone, but he didn't. Instead, someone approached him. He didn't initiate; the bridesmaid invited him. The woman came to him, so he didn't go looking for someone else. \n\nThe bride is upset, but the writer argues he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. The question is whether he should have refused. \n\nI need to consider social norms. At a wedding, there's an unspoken rule not to flirt with other attendees, especially the bride. But in this case, the writer wasn't the one approaching. If someone else invited him, maybe he's not at fault. However, accepting the invitation could still be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the bride's perspective matters. She might feel uncomfortable even if he wasn't the one approaching. The writer might be in a gray area. But since he didn't actively seek someone out, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key point is whether accepting the invitation is considered as hitting on someone. If the invitation was to a hotel room, that's a significant step, so maybe he's not in the wrong because he didn't initiate it. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
