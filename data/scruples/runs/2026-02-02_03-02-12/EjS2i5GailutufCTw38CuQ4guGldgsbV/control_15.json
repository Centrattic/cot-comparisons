It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. They were told beforehand not to hit on any women, but someone invited them to her hotel room, and they went along. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person was at their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on anyone. The person claims they didn't approach anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. The bride is upset, and the person is arguing that they didn't break the promise because it was the other person who initiated.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Let's consider social norms and expectations. Even if the person didn't actively hit on others, accepting an invitation to a hotel room from someone else could still be seen as inappropriate, especially given the context of an ex's wedding. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, which might extend to avoiding situations that could be interpreted as such. By going to the hotel room, the person might be violating that trust, even if it was the other person's idea. The bride's perspective is important here\u2014she might feel uncomfortable or disrespected if someone from the wedding, especially a former partner of the groom, is engaging in such behavior. \n\nAlso, the person's defense is that they didn't initiate it. However, social norms often place responsibility on both parties in such situations. Even if it was the other person's idea, showing up might still be seen as agreeing to a potentially problematic interaction. The person's presence at the wedding is already under scrutiny, so their actions, even if not aggressive, might still be causing the bride distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the person wasn't actively trying to hit on others and was just having a good time. The bridesmaid invited them, which complicates things. But given the sensitive setting and the explicit warning from the bride, the person might have an obligation to avoid situations that could be misinterpreted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. But generally, accepting such an invitation after being told not to hit on anyone could be seen as inconsiderate. The person didn't exactly break the rule as stated, but the action still caused harm. So the answer might lean towards A, the person is in the wrong, because their actions, even if not the initiation, still went against the spirit of the bride's request and caused her distress.\n"
