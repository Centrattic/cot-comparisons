It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding. He was told by the bride not to hit on any women, but when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he went. The bride is now upset.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author was warned by the bride not to hit on anyone. He says he wasn't actively trying to pick up women but was just having a good time. The bride is angry, he questions why it matters and if he broke any rules since the woman approached him.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The bride made a direct request, which he didn't follow. Even if someone else invited him, he still went along. The bride might feel that he disregarded her wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the author argues he didn't initiate the interaction.\n\nBut here's the thing: the bride's request was to not hit on any women. If he went to the hotel room with the bridesmaid, even if she invited him, it could be seen as participating in something the bride asked him not to do. Whether he initiated or not might be less important than following the request. The bride's feelings matter here, even if the author thinks it's overreacting.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the woman approached him, so he wasn't the one making moves. But the initial warning was a boundary set by the bride, which he crossed by accepting the invitation. Even if he didn't break a promise explicitly (since the woman approached him), he still violated the bride's wishes, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering the bride's perspective and the fact that he didn't heed her direct request, maybe the author is in the wrong. But others might side with him, thinking the woman's invitation wasn't his fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how strict one is about following such requests.\n"
