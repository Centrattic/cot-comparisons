It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author going to an ex's wedding, where the bride told him not to hit on anyone. He ends up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, and the bride is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author was told not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel. The key here is whether he initiated the interaction or if it was her who approached him. The user says the bridesmaid asked him and he agreed. The bride is upset, but the author argues that he didn't break his promise because she initiated it.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which could be interpreted as avoiding any romantic advances towards women at the wedding. If a bridesmaid invited him, maybe he should have declined, even if she initiated it. But the author points out that he wasn't the one approaching her. However, the bride's perspective might be that he should have turned down the invitation to avoid causing offense, especially given the recent breakup and the context of the wedding. \n\nAlso, the author is close to the groom's family, so maybe the bride's family dynamics are important. The bride might feel that any interaction between him and another woman at her wedding is inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. Even if he didn't break the explicit promise, the implicit social norms at a wedding might expect him to avoid such situations. \n\nOn the other hand, if the woman approached him and he didn't initiate the contact, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But the initial request by the bride to not hit on anyone could be seen as a warning to avoid any romantic interactions. The author might have thought that since the woman came to him, it's okay, but the bride still feels hurt. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's acceptance of the invitation violates the spirit of the bride's request. Even if he didn't explicitly hit on someone, being in a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior might be frowned upon. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not declining the invitation to avoid making the bride uncomfortable, even if he wasn't the one who approached her.\n"
