It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding and being asked not to hit on women there.\n\nFirst, the author received a direct request from the bride not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick people up but were just having a good time. However, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The bride explicitly told the author not to hit on anyone. The author agreed to that. 2) The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid. The author argues that they didn't initiate the contact, so they didn't break the promise. But the bride is still angry.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether accepting an invitation from a woman at the wedding counts as \"hitting on\" her, as per the bride's rule. If the author didn't approach anyone, but the woman approached him, does that matter? The author's reasoning is that they didn't initiate, so they followed the rule. But the bride might see any interaction as a problem, regardless of who started it.\n\nAlso, the ex's wedding adds a layer of complexity. The author might have a history with the bride's ex, but that's not directly the issue here. The main conflict is with the bride's expectations versus the author's actions.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, even if the author didn't start the interaction, being in a situation that could be seen as inappropriate at a wedding might be considered a breach. The bride made a specific request, which the author agreed to. If the author then ended up in a hotel room with someone else, that could be seen as violating that agreement, regardless of who initiated the contact. The author's defense that they didn't \"hit on\" anyone might not hold if the situation is perceived as such by the bride. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author was just being friendly and the women approached them, perhaps it's not their fault. But the author chose to accept the invitation to the hotel room, which is a more private setting. That decision might be the key point. Even if the author didn't initiate the contact, going to the hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the bride's prior warning.\n\nSo, considering the agreement the author made with the bride, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring that agreement, even if they didn't start the interaction. The author's choice to accept the invitation could be seen as the problem, regardless of who approached first. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
