It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author attended their ex's wedding. The soon-to-be bride told them not to hit on any women, which they thought was weird but agreed to. At the wedding, they were having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went along. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement and what actually happened. The bride asked the author not to hit on women. The author claims they didn't initiate anything; a bridesmaid approached them. So, the author didn't break their promise because they weren't the one making the move. But does that matter?\n\nThe bride is upset, and the author is confused why it's a problem. The question is about whether the author is wrong. From a social standpoint, attending an ex's wedding can be awkward. The bride made a specific request, so the author tried to comply. However, even if they didn't initiate, going to a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid might still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. The bride might feel that the author is disrespecting the wedding or her authority.\n\nBut the author argues that they didn't break their promise because the other person approached them. There's a difference between initiating and accepting an invitation. If the author agreed to not approach anyone, but accepted an invitation, maybe that's within the bounds of their agreement. However, the bride might still see it as inappropriate regardless of who initiated. \n\nSocial norms sometimes expect guests to avoid any behavior that could be seen as flirtatious, especially in such a setting. The author might be in a gray area. But since they didn't actively seek out attention, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's possible the bride overreacted. But the fact that the author went to the hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, even if they didn't initiate it. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The bride's request was specific, so the author tried to honor it. But perhaps the situation is nuanced. If someone approaches you, it's not always a yes to accept, especially in a sensitive context. However, the author didn't force the situation. The answer might hinge on whether accepting the invitation was within the original agreement. If the agreement was to not \"hit on\" women, which typically means initiating, then accepting an invitation might not be a violation. But the bride might still be upset regardless. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the explicit instruction. The confusion is on the bride's side. So the answer might be B, no. But some might argue that the author should have refused to avoid any appearance of impropriety. It's a bit of a judgment call. However, based on the information given, the author didn't break the promise, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
