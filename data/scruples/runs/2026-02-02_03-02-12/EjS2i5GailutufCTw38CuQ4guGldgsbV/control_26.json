It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went to his ex's wedding. The bride (now the ex's wife) told him beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. He said he wouldn't, but then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries set by the bride. She made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The author claims he didn't go out of his way to hit on anyone; he was just having a good time. But then a bridesmaid approached him. The key point here is whether the author should have turned down the invitation even if it wasn't his initiative.\n\nThe bride is upset because he went to the hotel room with someone else. Even though the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the author accepted. The problem here might be about respecting the bride's wishes. She asked him not to hit on any women, which could be interpreted as not engaging in any flirtatious behavior or any actions that might be seen as inappropriate, especially at her wedding. Going to a hotel room with someone else, even if initiated by another person, could be seen as violating that boundary.\n\nAlso, from a social perspective, weddings are sensitive events, especially when there's a previous relationship involved. The author's actions might be perceived as disrespectful, regardless of who initiated the interaction. The bride might feel that even if he didn't start it, accepting the invitation could be seen as him engaging in behavior that's inappropriate for the setting.\n\nHowever, the author argues that he didn't break his promise because it was the other person who approached him. But maybe the bride's initial request was more about him not initiating any advances, not necessarily about accepting invitations. The line here is blurry. If the bride's intention was to prevent any form of flirtation or romantic interactions, then accepting an invitation from someone else might still be considered a breach.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the wedding. Being at a wedding, especially of an ex, can be tricky. The author might not see the issue, but the bride could perceive it as a lack of respect or insensitivity. The fact that he's close to the groom and his family complicates things further. Perhaps the bride feels that his presence there is already delicate, and his actions have caused further tension.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a boundary she set. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on people, which might include accepting such invitations to maintain the sanctity of the wedding and her comfort. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes fully.\n"
