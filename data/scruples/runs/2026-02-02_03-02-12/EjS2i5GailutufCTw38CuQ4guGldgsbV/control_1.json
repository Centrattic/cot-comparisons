It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author went to a wedding where their ex is getting married. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author says they weren't actively trying to pick people up but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nSo the main points here are the promise made to the bride and the author's actions. The author claims they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the bride is upset regardless. The key issue is whether the author honored the agreement they made with the bride.\n\nThe author was explicitly told not to hit on women at the wedding. By accepting an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid, even if it wasn't initiated by the author, it could be seen as violating that agreement. The bride's request was to avoid any advances, so the author's action, regardless of who initiated it, might still be considered a breach. \n\nAlso, considering social norms, attending a wedding where an ex is involved requires a certain level of sensitivity. The author's actions, even if not their initiation, could be perceived as disrespectful to the bride's feelings. The fact that the bride is upset suggests that the action crossed a boundary she set. \n\nThe author might argue that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, but the original agreement was to not hit on anyone. Accepting such an invitation could be seen as participating in behavior the bride wanted to avoid. The line between socializing and flirting can be blurry, but in this context, the author's acceptance might have been a mistake.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author didn't start the interaction, they did accept it, which could still be considered a violation of the bride's wishes. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
