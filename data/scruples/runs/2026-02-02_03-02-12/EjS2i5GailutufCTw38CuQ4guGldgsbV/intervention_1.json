It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding. They were friends with the groom and the family, so it's understandable they were invited. The bride told them before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author says they didn't go out of their way to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the author was given a direct request by the bride not to hit on anyone. Even if it felt weird, the author chose to comply by not initiating. However, when the bridesmaid approached them, they accepted the invitation. The key point here is whether the author's acceptance of the invitation constitutes breaking the promise. The author argues that the girl approached them, so they didn't initiate the contact. The bride is upset because of the interaction, but the author didn't go out of their way to hit on someone. \n\nConsidering social norms, even if the invitation wasn't initiated by the author, being at an ex's wedding and engaging in a romantic situation might be seen as inappropriate. However, the author didn't break their explicit promise. The bride's reaction is based on her own discomfort, but the author followed the rule as they understood it. It might be a gray area, but technically, the author didn't violate the agreement. So, maybe the answer is B.\n"
