It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending their ex's wedding where the bride told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they didn't initiate the interaction; a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. The bride is upset, even though the author argues they didn't break the promise since the woman approached him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Weddings are sensitive events, especially when exes are involved. The bride gave a direct request, so even if the author didn't actively seek to hit on others, accepting an invitation from someone else could still be problematic. The key point here is that the author didn't reject the offer, which might be seen as respecting boundaries. However, the bride's request was specific, and the author might have crossed a line by engaging in that situation, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer. It's possible that the bride felt uncomfortable with the author's presence at all, and this incident could have exacerbated her feelings. Even if the author wasn't the one approaching others, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be perceived as inappropriate, especially in that context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they were just having fun and not actively trying to hit on anyone. The invitation from the bridesmaid was initiated by her, so the author might argue they were just being social. However, the bride's feelings are valid; she might feel that the author's presence and actions at the wedding caused her discomfort or upset. \n\nSocial etiquette often emphasizes respecting the host's wishes. The bride's request was a boundary, and the author's action, even if not a direct violation, could be seen as disregarding that boundary. The author's defense that they didn't break the promise is a bit thin because the essence of the request was to avoid any advances, which could include accepting invitations from others if they're perceived as such. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have intended to hurt anyone, their actions could be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding they were attending as a guest. The bride's request was clear, and the author's decision to accept the invitation might have been inconsiderate of her feelings and the overall situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
