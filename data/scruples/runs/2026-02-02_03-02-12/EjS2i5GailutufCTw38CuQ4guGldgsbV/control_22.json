It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down the girl at the wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't actively hitting on anyone but was just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation. The key points here are the bride's prior request, the author's actions, and the social norms around exes at weddings.\n\nThe bride asked the author not to hit on anyone. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to pick people up, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing the line, especially since the bride was explicit about her wishes. The author argues that the girl approached them, but the responsibility might still lie with the author to respect the bride's boundaries. Socially, it's considered disrespectful to engage in such behavior at someone else's wedding, especially an ex's, because it can be seen as undermining the event and the bride's feelings. \n\nEven if the author didn't break their promise (since the girl approached them), the action itself might still be offensive to the bride. The fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer of sensitivity. The bride's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected, regardless of how the author intended their actions. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the boundaries set by the bride, even if they didn't initiate the contact. Social norms often hold that in such situations, the person should prioritize the feelings of the host and the bride, even if the contact was initiated by another guest.\n"
