      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about them not turning down a girl's invitation to her hotel room at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. A bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author violated the bride's request and if they're in the wrong. The author argues they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did. The bride's request was to not hit on women, and the author says they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. The bride specifically asked the author not to hit on her wedding guests. Even if the author wasn't the one initiating, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as participating in the behavior the bride wanted to avoid. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. If the author was just mingling and dancing, but then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, accepting that could be perceived as crossing the line, even if they didn't approach her first.\n\nAlso, the author's relationship with the groom and family might be a factor. The bride might have expected the author to respect her boundaries, especially given the close relationship. The fact that the author was at the wedding at the bride's invitation (since it's her wedding) adds another layer. She might have felt responsible for setting the tone and ensuring the author didn't make her or her guests uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. But the promise was about not hitting on anyone, not necessarily about not accepting invitations from others. If the author was in a social setting where the bride had asked them to be respectful, then engaging in a private meeting at the hotel might still be a breach of that understanding, even if initiated by the other person.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's behavior being perceived as disrespectful to the bride. Even if the author had no romantic intentions, the bride might feel that the author didn't consider her feelings and expectations. Socially, showing up to an event where the host has set boundaries and then disregarding those can lead to the perception of being inconsiderate or an asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly wasn't trying to pick up anyone and the interaction was consensual between them and the bridesmaid, maybe the issue is more about the bride's sensitivity. However, the key point is the promise the author made to the bride. If they agreed not to hit on anyone, then accepting a romantic or flirtatious invitation, regardless of who initiated it, could be seen as a violation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's explicit request, even if the interaction was initiated by the bridesmaid. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on any women, and the author's acceptance of the hotel room invitation could be seen as participating in the behavior the bride wanted to prevent. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
