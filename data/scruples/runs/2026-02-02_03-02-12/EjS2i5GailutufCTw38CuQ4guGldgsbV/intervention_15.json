It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author went to the wedding of their ex, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride warned them not to hit on any women, and the author agreed. But then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author break the agreement? The bride said not to hit on women, but the author claims the bridesmaid approached them. The author didn't initiate the contact. But maybe the issue is that even if the girl approached them, being at an ex's wedding and going to someone's hotel room could be seen as crossing a line. The bride might feel that the author is still being inappropriate, even if they didn't hit on her directly. Also, the author was there with a close friend (the groom), so maybe being in that environment adds to the tension. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful to the bride, especially since they were warned beforehand. However, if the author didn't actively seek out the situation, it's a bit of a gray area. It depends on whether the act of accepting the invitation is considered hitting on someone, even if it was the other person who initiated. The bride might still feel violated by the author's presence and the subsequent actions. On the other hand, the author didn't break the promise per se, since they didn't approach the girl first. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's a cultural expectation that at a wedding, especially an ex's, you should be more careful. It's a tough call. I think the answer could go either way, but the user thinks the author isn't wrong. The key is whether the author's actions, even if not directly hitting on someone, caused the bride distress. If the author genuinely didn't mean to break the agreement, but the situation is still problematic, there might be blame. But if the author followed the agreement as they understood it, maybe not. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong here because the initiation was from the bridesmaid, but there's a nuance where being in that situation could still be seen as disrespectful. Hmm.\n"
