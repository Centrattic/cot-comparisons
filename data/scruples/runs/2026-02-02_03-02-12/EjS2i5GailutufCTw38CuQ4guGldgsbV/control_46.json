It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding, and he was told by the bride not to hit on anyone. But when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he accepted, and now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author was told in advance not to hit on any women. He says he didn't go out of his way to pick up anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited him, he went along. The key points here are the initial warning and the nature of the invitation.\n\nThe bride is upset, and the author is trying to justify it by saying he didn't approach her first. But the problem is that he was at an event where he was specifically told not to hit on women. Even if the invitation came from someone else, being in that environment might still be problematic. The bride could feel that by accepting the invitation, he was disregarding her wishes, even if he didn't initiate it. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding adds another layer. Even if there's no romantic history with the bridesmaid, the bride might be sensitive about any interactions there. The author's presence at the wedding is already a potential issue, given the ex relationship. By accepting an invitation to a hotel room, he might be crossing a line that the bride set for the event.\n\nBut the author argues he didn't break the promise because the invitation came from the other person. However, the bride's main point is about him not hitting on anyone. If the interaction didn't involve trying to pick her up, maybe the author isn't at fault. But the hotel room invitation could be seen as a form of hitting on her, depending on the context. If they ended up in a private setting, that might be beyond just mingling or dancing. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a judgment call. If the author genuinely didn't have intentions of hitting on her and just accepted the invitation as a social interaction, maybe he's not in the wrong. But given the bride's specific instructions and the sensitive nature of the event, he might have overstepped by being in that situation. The answer might depend on whether the hotel room interaction was consensual and not involving him pursuing her. If the invitation was reciprocated and not initiated by him, he might not be at fault. But if it's seen as him taking advantage of the situation despite the warnings, then he could be wrong. It's tricky.\n"
