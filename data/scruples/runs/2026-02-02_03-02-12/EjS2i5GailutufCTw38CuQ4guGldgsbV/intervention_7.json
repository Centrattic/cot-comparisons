It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was at their ex's wedding, and the bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author wasn't actively trying to pick people up but was having a good time. Then, one of the bridesmaids invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was friends with the groom and attended the wedding. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, which the author agreed to. However, in this case, the bridesmaid approached the author, not the other way around. The author didn't initiate the approach, so maybe that's a key point. \n\nBut then, even if the girl approached him, was it appropriate for him to accept the invitation? The bride might feel that by accepting, he's still violating the unspoken rule of not engaging in such behavior at her wedding, even if it wasn't exactly hitting on someone. \n\nAlso, the author is an ex, so there might be some lingering sensitivity. The bride's reaction could be based on feeling that the author is causing discomfort or disrespecting the event. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as inappropriate regardless of who approached whom. \n\nAnother angle is that the bride's request was a boundary set beforehand. The author agreed to it, so by accepting the invitation, he's breaking that boundary. That could make him the asshole for not honoring the agreement, even if he didn't actively pursue someone. \n\nBut the author argues that he didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. However, the bride might still feel that the author's presence in the hotel room with a bridesmaid is problematic, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior is typically frowned upon. \n\nIt's also about social norms. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting such an invitation could be seen as going against the expectations set by the bride. The author's actions might have caused embarrassment or discomfort, which is why the bride is upset. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect the boundary set by the bride, even if the interaction was initiated by someone else. The key here is that the bride had made a specific request, and the author's actions, though not direct, still violated that request. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
