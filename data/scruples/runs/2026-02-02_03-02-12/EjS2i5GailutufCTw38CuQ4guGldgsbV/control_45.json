It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context and the expectations set by the bride.\n\nFirst, the person is at their ex's wedding. The bride had specifically told them not to hit on any women there. They went to the wedding, drank, mingled, and then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel. They accepted. Now the bride is upset. \n\nThe person argues they didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid did. But the problem here is the setting. Even if they didn't start it, being at an ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior can be seen as crossing a line. The bride's request was a boundary, and even if it's not a legal or binding promise, respecting boundaries is key in social interactions. \n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that they were close to the groom, but that doesn't negate the bride's feelings. Accepting an invitation to someone's hotel room is a big deal, especially in that context. The person might not have broken an explicit promise, but they disregarded the implied expectation. \n\nSo, even if their intention was just to have a good time, the consequences hurt the bride. Whether they intended to or not, their actions led to her being upset. Society often expects people to respect others' boundaries, especially in sensitive situations like a wedding. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their actions would affect the bride, despite her direct request.\n"
