It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding, despite the bride's warning.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which they found odd but agreed to. At the wedding, they were just having fun, drinking, and socializing. Then a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was told not to hit on anyone, and they didn't initiate the interaction. The bride is angry, but the author argues they didn't break the promise since the girl approached them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. Even if the author didn't initiate, being at an ex's wedding might require extra sensitivity. The bride's request, though direct, might stem from wanting to avoid any appearance of impropriety, given the ex's connection. The author didn't explicitly agree to avoid all interactions with women, just not to hit on them. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. The author's presence at the wedding because of the groom's family might also add complexity. But since the author didn't make the first move, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. However, the situation could be seen as insensitive, especially considering the bride's concerns. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the bride's request and the social context, even if they didn't initiate the interaction.\n"
