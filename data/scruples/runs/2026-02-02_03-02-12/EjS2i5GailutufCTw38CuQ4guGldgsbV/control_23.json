It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at his ex's wedding. The situation is that the ex got married, and the author went to the wedding because he's close with the groom. The bride told him before the wedding not to hit on any women there. At the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author violated any agreements. The bride directly told him not to hit on any women. He claims he didn't ask her out; she invited him. But the key point is whether he agreed to her invitation. Even if he didn't initiate the approach, accepting her invitation could still fall under \"hitting on women,\" depending on how the bride and others view it.\n\nAlso, the context is his ex's wedding. There might be sensitivities about his presence and behavior. The author might be in the wrong if he knew beforehand about the bride's request and still went along with the invitation. But he argues that she approached him, not the other way around. However, the bride's perspective is that he didn't turn her down, which might be why she's upset. \n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In some circles, attending a wedding of an ex and interacting in that way could be seen as inappropriate regardless of the initial agreement. But the author didn't explicitly agree to not interacting with any women, just not to \"hit on\" them. If the bridesmaid's invitation was a genuine social interaction and not part of \"picking up\" someone, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But the line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry.\n\nThe author's defense is that he wasn't actively trying to pick up women but was just having a good time. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior could be frowned upon. The bride's request was to avoid any advances, so even if she initiated, his acceptance might be seen as violating that agreement.\n\nSo, considering the agreement he made and the potential breach by accepting the invitation, even if it wasn't initiated by him, he might be in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
