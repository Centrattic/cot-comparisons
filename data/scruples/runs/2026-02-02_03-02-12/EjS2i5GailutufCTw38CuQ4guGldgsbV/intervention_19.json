It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at his ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author attended his ex's wedding, which was a bit awkward, but he's close to the groom and family. The soon-to-be bride told him not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively try to pick up anyone but was just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the initial request from the bride and the circumstances of the interaction. The bride asked him not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. However, he didn't approach anyone; instead, someone else approached him. The author didn't initiate the contact, which might be a crucial factor. \n\nSome might argue that he should have turned down the invitation regardless, especially since it could be seen as taking advantage of the situation at the wedding. Others might say that the bride's request was about him initiating, not others approaching him. The author didn't break his promise because he wasn't the one making the advances. \n\nBut there's also the social context. Even if he didn't break his word, attending an ex's wedding and then going off with a bridesmaid might be seen as insensitive or crossing a line. The bride's reaction could be based on the fact that it happened at her wedding, which is a significant event where she might expect certain boundaries. \n\nHowever, if the author wasn't actively trying to pick up women and just accepted an invitation from someone else, it's debatable whether he's at fault. The main issue is whether he violated the bride's request. Since the request was about him hitting on women, and he didn't do that, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The bride's feelings are valid, and social norms might suggest that the author should have been more cautious. But technically, if he didn't break his promise, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the initial agreement was about initiation or just general behavior.\n"
