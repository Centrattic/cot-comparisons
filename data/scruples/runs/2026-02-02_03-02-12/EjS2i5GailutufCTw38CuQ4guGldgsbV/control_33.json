It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom and family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author didn't actively hit on anyone but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they did something wrong.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the prior agreement and the situation that unfolded. The bride specifically asked the author not to hit on others. The author claims they didn't initiate the contact; they were invited by the bridesmaid. But even if the author didn't approach her, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the bride's request. \n\nEven if the author wasn't the one to start it, by agreeing to go to the hotel room, they're still participating in something that the bride considers inappropriate. The bride's request was broad, so whether the author crossed a line might depend on the context. The author's argument is that they didn't break the promise because it was the other person who approached them. But maybe the bride's request was meant to prevent any such situations, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's an ex's wedding adds another layer. Maybe the bride was sensitive about her new husband's ex interacting with others in a romantic way. The author might not see it as hitting on someone if they were just having a good time, but the outcome still upset the bride. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't directly hit on women, accepting an invitation from someone else could still be seen as a breach of the agreement. The line between socializing and flirting can be blurry, but the bride's clear instruction was to not hit on anyone. If the author thought they were following the rules but ended up in a situation the bride considers a violation, then maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the author didn't have any intent to hit on others and the situation was a mutual choice, then they might not be at fault. But given the bride's perspective, the author's actions, regardless of intent, caused her distress. So it's a bit of a gray area, but the fact that the bride was upset and the author's presence there might make them responsible for respecting her wishes, even if others initiated the interaction. \n\nI think the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't fully respect the bride's boundaries, even if the other person approached them. The prior agreement was to avoid hitting on anyone, so any romantic or flirtatious interactions, regardless of initiation, could be seen as violating that. The author's defense that they were invited doesn't negate the fact that it's a situation the bride considered a breach. So yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
