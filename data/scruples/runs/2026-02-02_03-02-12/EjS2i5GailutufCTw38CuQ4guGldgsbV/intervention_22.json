It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told him not to hit on any women there. The author says he wasn't actively trying to pick up anyone but was just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went along. The bride is upset about it, and the author is questioning his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was invited to the wedding because he's close to the groom and his family. The bride had made a direct request not to hit on women, which the author thought was strange. However, he claims he didn't approach anyone; instead, the bridesmaid approached him. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The bride's request was about not hitting on women, which is a form of setting boundaries. The author argues that since the bridesmaid initiated the invitation, he wasn't the one approaching her. But does that matter? Even if the woman approached him, by accepting the invitation, he is still engaging in a situation that could be seen as crossing the bride's boundaries. \n\nAnother angle is the social expectations at weddings. It's common for guests to behave respectfully and avoid any behavior that might make the newlyweds uncomfortable. The author's action, while not explicitly hitting on the bridesmaid, still led to a situation that upset the bride. Even if the author didn't have malicious intent, the outcome caused hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, the author was aware of the bride's request in advance. He might have known that the bride was sensitive about this issue. By not declining the invitation, he disregarded her feelings, even if he didn't break his promise explicitly. The fact that the bride is now \"pissed\" suggests that the action had a negative impact on her. \n\nThere's a difference between not actively pursuing others and being in a position where someone else's actions affect others. The author might not have intended to hit on anyone, but his acceptance of the invitation could still be seen as disrespectful to the bride's wishes. \n\nIn social situations, sometimes the perception matters as much as the action. The bride might feel that allowing someone to go to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, even if initiated by the woman, is inappropriate. The author's presence in that scenario could be viewed as contributing to the problem. \n\nConsidering all these points, even though the author didn't directly hit on anyone, his decision to accept the invitation might have been inconsiderate of the bride's feelings and the situation. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the implicit boundaries set by the bride, even if the action wasn't a direct violation of her explicit request.\n"
