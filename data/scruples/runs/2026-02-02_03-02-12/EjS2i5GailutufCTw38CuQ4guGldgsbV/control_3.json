It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went to his ex's wedding, which he was invited to because he's close with the groom and the family. The bride told him before the wedding not to hit on any women there. He says he didn't go looking for anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The bride made a direct request that he not hit on women. He claims he didn't initiate the contact; the bridesmaid approached him. But even if that's true, is there an issue? Well, the question is whether he was wrong to accept the invitation. \n\nFrom the perspective of the bride, she might feel that any attention from an ex, even if not initiated by him, could be uncomfortable or inappropriate. Even if he wasn't hitting on others, accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding might still be seen as inappropriate given the context. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding adds another layer. It's possible that the bride is sensitive about her ex interacting with other people, even in a platonic way. The author might argue that he wasn't breaking any rules since the bride approached him, but the bride's discomfort could still be valid. \n\nHowever, the author's actions don't seem malicious. He was having a good time, not intentionally trying to upset anyone. But social norms often dictate that certain boundaries should be respected, especially in a wedding setting where the ex is involved. The key point is whether accepting the invitation crossed a line, even if he didn't initiate it. \n\nIn some cultures, attending an ex's wedding might come with unspoken rules about behavior, and the bride's request, while perhaps harsh, is a boundary she set. By accepting the invitation, the author might have disregarded her feelings, even if he followed the letter of her request by not approaching others. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong not because he was hitting on people, but because he didn't consider the bride's feelings and the sensitivity of the situation. Even passive acceptance could be seen as inappropriate in that context. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
