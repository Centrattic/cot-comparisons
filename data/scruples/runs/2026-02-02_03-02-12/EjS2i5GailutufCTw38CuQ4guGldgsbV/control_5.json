It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario involves the author attending the wedding of their ex, where the soon-to-be bride had asked them not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was invited to the wedding, which was their ex's. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on women. The author didn't initiate the interaction; a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. The author agreed. Now, the bride is angry.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author violated the bride's request. The author argues that since the invitation came from the bridesmaid and they didn't approach her, they didn't break the promise. However, the bride's request was to not hit on any women, which could be interpreted as not engaging in any romantic or flirtatious behavior. By accepting the invitation to the hotel room, even if it was initiated by the bridesmaid, the author might have crossed a line. \n\nEven if the author didn't start the interaction, being in a private setting with someone else at their ex's wedding could be seen as insensitive or as violating the unspoken boundaries. The bride's request might have been to prevent any situations that could make her uncomfortable, especially since it's her big day. The author's presence there is with the groom, which could make the situation more awkward if they were to be seen with another woman. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions they were drinking and mingling. While that's common at weddings, it's possible that the alcohol influenced their judgment. However, the main question is about whether they were in the wrong. The fact that the bridesmaid initiated the invitation complicates things, but the author chose to accept. In social norms, it's often considered respectful to avoid situations that might cause discomfort to others, especially when given a direct request. \n\nThe bride's anger might stem from feeling that the author disregarded her boundaries, even if technically the author didn't initiate the interaction. The perception matters here. The author's decision to go to the hotel room could be seen as a breach of trust, especially with the groom. \n\nSo, considering the context, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't honor the implied boundaries, even if they didn't start the interaction. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
