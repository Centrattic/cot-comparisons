It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The context is that the author was told by the soon-to-be bride not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset, and the author is confused because he didn't \"hit on\" anyone; the other person approached him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was told not to hit on anyone, which they agreed to. They were at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride is upset because the author went to the hotel with a bridesmaid. The author argues that the woman initiated the contact, so he didn't break the promise. But promises can be tricky\u2014usually, if someone is approached and they accept an invitation, even if initiated by the other person, the person being approached might still be seen as violating a social contract if they agreed not to do that. \n\nSocial norms around weddings are important here. Weddings are times where people are supposed to be respectful, especially when there's an ex involved. The author is close to the groom, so their actions could reflect poorly on the entire event. Even if the author didn't approach the woman, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as encouraging behavior, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nThe bride's request was a direct warning, so the author's response (accepting the invitation) could be seen as disregarding her feelings and the trust she put in him. The argument that the woman initiated it might not matter because the author agreed not to engage in such behavior. The key is whether the author upheld their promise, which they might not have because they ended up in a situation that's perceived as inappropriate. \n\nSo, the author might be considered in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's request, even if they didn't initiate the interaction. Socially, being in a situation like a hotel room with someone else's wedding party member could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the ex relationship. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they failed to respect the boundaries set by the bride, even if the action was reciprocated.\n"
