It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is at their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person claims they didn't go looking for attention, but when a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, but I need to evaluate both sides. The bride's perspective is important here. She made a direct request not to hit on anyone, so the author might have thought they were following that by not initiating contact. However, the author did accept an invitation from a bridesmaid, which the bride might see as going against her wishes. The key points are: 1. Was the author's action a violation of the bride's request? 2. Is there a cultural or social expectation that the author should have known to avoid even accepting such an invitation? 3. Could the author's presence at the wedding, given their history, cause discomfort regardless of their actions?\n\nThe bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which implies she wanted the author to avoid approaching others. The author didn't approach but accepted an invitation. However, the situation's context is a wedding where social norms might be more strict, especially regarding guests' expectations. Even if the author didn't initiate, the acceptance could still be seen as problematic from the bride's perspective, given the prior warning. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they respected the initial request by not making the first move. But social situations can be tricky, and even passive acceptance might not align with the bride's intentions. The author's ex is the groom, so their presence might already be sensitive. Accepting a hotel invite could be seen as inappropriate regardless of the initiation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about respecting the bride's boundaries. If the bride felt uncomfortable and made a direct request, the author's decision to accept an invitation, even if not initiated by them, might still be considered a breach of that trust. The author's argument that the bride picked them up is a good point, but the broader social context of a wedding might mean that such interactions are frowned upon regardless of who made the first move. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be seen as in the wrong because they disregarded the bride's specific request, even if the action was a response rather than an initiation. The bride's feelings and the context of the wedding's formality play a role here. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong).\n"
