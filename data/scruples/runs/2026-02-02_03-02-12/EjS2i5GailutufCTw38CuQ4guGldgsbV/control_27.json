It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the ex got married, and the author was invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author went along. The bride is upset now, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the main points here are the promise not to hit on anyone and the action of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid. The author says they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the bride is upset regardless. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author honored the bride's request. Even if the author didn't initiate the interaction, they still agreed to go to her hotel room. That could be seen as violating the spirit of the promise, even if not the letter. The bride might feel that the author is still being inappropriate by engaging with another woman at her wedding, especially with an ex involved. \n\nAlso, the context is a wedding, which is about the couple. The author's presence might be sensitive, and interacting with a bridesmaid could be perceived as rude or disrespectful. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to \"hit on\" anyone, the situation could be misunderstood. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's wishes by not avoiding any situations that could be seen as inappropriate, even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid. It's about respecting boundaries and considering how their actions affect others, especially the bride who was already sensitive about the situation.\n"
