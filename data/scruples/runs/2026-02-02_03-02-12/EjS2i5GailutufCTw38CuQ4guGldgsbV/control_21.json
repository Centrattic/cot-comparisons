It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author says they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he agreed. The bride is upset about this. The author argues they didn't break their promise because the woman approached him, not the other way around.\n\nSo, the key points here are the bride's request and the author's actions. The author was told not to hit on anyone. Even if he wasn't actively trying to pick people up, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. The woman was a bridesmaid, so being alone with her might be sensitive in that context. The bride might feel that the author disregarded her request, which could be a breach of trust or respect. Plus, even if the woman invited him, the author's decision to go along with it might still be problematic, especially considering the wedding setting and the bride's direct instruction. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the bride's feelings and the potential implications of his actions, even if they didn't initiate the invitation. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
