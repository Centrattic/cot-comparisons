It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was warned by the bride beforehand not to hit on any women. However, one of the bridesmaids invited the author to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was told not to hit on any women at the wedding. They didn't actively approach someone but were invited by the bridesmaid. The author didn't initiate the contact, which might be a key factor here. The question is about whether the author is responsible for accepting the invitation, even if it wasn't their idea.\n\nThe bride's demand seems a bit strict, but the author was under the impression that they weren't supposed to make advances. However, since the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the author's acceptance could be seen as complying. But maybe the issue is that the author went to the hotel room, which might be considered inappropriate regardless of who initiated it, especially at an ex's wedding. \n\nAnother angle is the context of the wedding. The author is attending a wedding of an ex, which can be awkward. The author's actions might be perceived as disrespectful, even if they didn't start the interaction. The bride might feel that any interaction leading to a romantic or sexual encounter is inappropriate, especially with someone connected to the ex. \n\nBut the author didn't violate the promise because the invitation came from the other person. The author's main defense is that they didn't initiate the contact. However, accepting such an invitation could still be seen as crossing a line, depending on cultural or personal norms. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author's responsibility is to respect the bride's boundaries, even if the other person made the first move. The fact that the author went along with it despite the warning might be considered a breach, even if passive. \n\nOn the other hand, if the bride's request was to not hit on anyone, and the author didn't initiate, then maybe they're not at fault. But the act of going to the hotel room might be seen as hitting on someone, regardless of who asked. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions count as hitting on someone. If the author accepted but didn't initiate, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the mere acceptance is considered hitting on, then they are. It's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConsidering social norms, going to a hotel room with someone from the wedding is generally frowned upon, especially if the person is connected to the ex. The bride might feel the author is making her ex uncomfortable or violating the wedding's sanctity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't start the interaction, accepting the invitation might still be seen as crossing a boundary set by the bride. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if passively.\n"
