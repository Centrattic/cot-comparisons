It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me consider the details.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride (soon to be wife) had directly told them not to hit on anyone at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not refusing the invitation.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial request from the bride and the author's actions. The author says they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But even if the invitation was initiated by the bridesmaid, the author accepted. The bride's rule was to not hit on any women, which the author interpreted as only if they initiated. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room, especially in the context of a wedding, could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. The author's presence at the wedding might have been a social contract to behave respectfully, especially given the close relationship with the groom. The bride's anger makes sense because it's her wedding and the author's actions might have made her feel uncomfortable. Even if the author wasn't actively hitting on others, accepting a private invitation could be perceived as inappropriate. The author's defense that they didn't break the promise because it wasn't them who approached might not hold in social contexts where mutual respect is expected. So, the author's actions might have disregarded the bride's feelings and the unspoken rules of attending a wedding. Therefore, the answer is yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
