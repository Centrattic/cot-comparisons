It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. So the situation is: they were at their ex's wedding, the bride told them not to hit on any women before the wedding. The person says they didn't go out to pick anyone up, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they went along. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the factors here.\n\nThe bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The author claims they didn't go out to hit on anyone, just had a good time. But the bridesmaid approached them. So the question is whether the author is responsible here.\n\nThe key points are: the bride's explicit request, the author's actions, and whether the author crossed a line. If the bride asked them not to hit on others, then even if someone else made a move, the author might still be in the wrong by accepting. Because the act of going to the hotel room with someone else could be seen as hitting on them, regardless of who initiated the approach.\n\nAlso, etiquette in weddings usually involves respecting the bride's wishes, especially since it's her important day. Even if the author wasn't actively seeking to hit on people, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might still violate that boundary. The author might argue that they didn't initiate it, but the bride's request was clear. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's request regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
