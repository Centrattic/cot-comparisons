It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context: the author is at their ex's wedding, they weren't supposed to hit on anyone, and a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room.\n\nFirst, the bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset now, even though she says she approached the author, not the other way around.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author argues they didn't break the promise because it was the girl who initiated the invitation. But the bride is upset anyway. So, the key factors here are the initial agreement not to hit on anyone, the actions taken, and the perception of the bride.\n\nEven though the author didn't actively go out to hit on people, accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding might still be seen as violating the agreement. The bride probably wanted to prevent any attention on other women at her wedding, regardless of who initiated. The author's defense is that the girl came to him, but the context of being at the ex's wedding and the prior agreement might mean that the author should have avoided the situation entirely. \n\nThere's also the aspect of being at an ex's wedding. Even if there's no romantic connection anymore, the author's actions could be seen as inappropriate or inconsiderate, especially if the bride felt it was a breach of trust or respect. The fact that the author was close to the groom might make the bride's anger more justified because she expected higher standards from someone in the inner circle.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't actively seek out the situation, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line that they were asked not to cross. The bride's perspective is valid here because she might feel that any attention received at her wedding is problematic, regardless of who initiated it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring the spirit of the agreement, even if the letter of the agreement wasn't technically broken.\n"
