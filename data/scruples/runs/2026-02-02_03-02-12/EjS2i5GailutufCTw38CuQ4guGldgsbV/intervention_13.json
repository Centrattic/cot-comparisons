It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author attended the wedding of their ex, was friends with the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which the author found weird but agreed to. However, one of the bridesmaids invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's position is that they didn't break their promise because the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's the case.\n\nSo, the key points here: the bride made a direct request not to hit on any women. The author didn't actively approach someone but was invited by a bridesmaid. The author accepted the invitation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for that.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, when someone asks you not to flirt or hit on others at their event, it's usually to avoid making them uncomfortable or causing drama. Even if the author didn't initiate the contact, by accepting the invitation, they might be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes. The bride might feel that the author is still engaging in behavior she asked them to avoid. The line here is blurry. If the author was genuinely having a good time and not trying to pick up others, but accepted an invitation from someone else, is that their fault?\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is at their ex's wedding adds another layer. Maybe the bride is sensitive about the ex's presence and any interactions, even if the author didn't do anything wrong. The author might not have intended to disrespect the bride, but by going to the hotel room, they could be perceived as doing so. \n\nBut then again, the author didn't approach the bridesmaid; they were invited. So the responsibility might also lie with the bridesmaid. However, the author's agreement to go could still be an issue. It's a matter of whether the author should have refused the invitation even if they weren't initiating it. \n\nIn some cultures or social norms, accepting such an invitation might be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where the bride is already on edge. The author might be in a position where they should have considered the bride's feelings and declined the offer to avoid any conflict, even if they weren't the one starting it. \n\nBut the author's argument is that they didn't break the promise. The bride said not to hit on any women, and the author didn't actively hit on anyone. The problem arises from the fact that they accepted the invitation, which the bride might interpret as hitting on. So the confusion is between the definition of \"hitting on\" in this context. If the author wasn't initiating, but accepting, maybe they are in the right. However, if the act of accepting is considered as hitting on, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the author was friends with the groom and his family. Should they be more cautious in their behavior at the wedding, considering the close relationship? Even if the bride didn't like it, maybe the author should have anticipated that and avoided any situations that could be misinterpreted. \n\nIt's a tough call. The answer would depend on how \"hitting on\" is defined. If the author didn't make any moves, just accepted an invitation, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the author's presence in the hotel room was seen as inappropriate regardless, then maybe they are. The bride's reaction might be over the top, but the author's action could still be the trigger. \n\nIn the end, it's about intent and perception. The author's intent was to have a good time and not to disrespect the bride, but the action led to her being upset. So, the answer could be B (No), because the author didn't actively hit on anyone, but maybe A (Yes) if the situation is considered disrespectful even if passive. But I think the key here is that the author was invited, so they might not be in the wrong. However, the context of a wedding and a close relationship with the groom might mean they should have been more careful. Hmm. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B, the author isn't in the wrong, since they followed the initial instruction not to initiate and didn't break the promise directly. But some might argue they should have refused the invitation to avoid making the bride uncomfortable.\n"
