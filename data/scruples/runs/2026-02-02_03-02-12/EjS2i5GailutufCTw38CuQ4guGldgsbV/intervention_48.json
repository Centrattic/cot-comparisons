It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author's ex got married, and the author was invited because they're close with the groom and family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author felt it was a strange request but agreed. Later, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset, but the author argues he didn't initiate the contact and didn't break his promise.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the bride's request and the author's actions. The bride directly asked the author not to hit on anyone, which he agreed to. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone but was just enjoying the party. The bridesmaid approached him, so he didn't initiate the interaction. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe bride's perspective is important. She might feel that even if the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could still be seen as inappropriate. Weddings are sensitive, and the bride might be protective of her event, especially since the author is the ex of the groom. The author's presence could be awkward, and any interaction between him and the bridesmaids, even if consensual, might be viewed as crossing a line. \n\nHowever, the author didn't explicitly promise to avoid all interactions; he was told not to hit on anyone. The bridesmaid's invitation might be her own decision, and if the author didn't push for it, maybe he's not fully at fault. But accepting the invitation could still be seen as not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if the direct request was about him approaching others. The bride might feel that by going to the hotel room, he's still contributing to an uncomfortable situation, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAnother angle: the social norms around weddings. Even if the author is close with the groom, the bride's request implies that she wanted to avoid any potential issues. The author's decision to go to the hotel room might be seen as disregarding her feelings and the sensitivities of the event. While he didn't start it, his acceptance could still make the bride feel her request was ignored.\n\nAlso, the author's own statement that he was \"having a good time\" and \"drinking\" might suggest that maybe he was in a state where he was more open to such invitations. But the main issue is whether he respected the bride's direct request. If she asked him not to hit on anyone, and he ended up in a private setting with a bridesmaid, that might be seen as violating the spirit of her request, even if not the letter.\n\nSo, weighing these points: the author didn't initiate, but he still went along with the invitation. The bride's reaction is about the comfort of the event and her own feelings. Depending on cultural or personal boundaries, this could be seen as the author not respecting those boundaries. Therefore, maybe the answer leans towards A (in the wrong), but there are arguments on both sides. However, the bride's direct request and the author's acceptance might make him culpable in her eyes, even if he didn't initiate contact.\n"
