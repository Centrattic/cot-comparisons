It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person attended their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The writer says they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the promise made by the bride and the action taken by the writer. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, and the writer agreed. But the defense is that the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. So the question is whether agreeing to go to the hotel room violates the bride's request.\n\nThe bride's request was about not hitting on women, which can be interpreted as approaching them with the intent to flirt or pursue. If the writer wasn't initiating, but someone else approached them, does that still count as hitting on someone? The line here is a bit blurry. If the writer is in a social setting where someone else makes a move, is it the writer's fault for accepting? Also, the fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid might be seen as participating in the behavior the bride asked them to avoid.\n\nBut the writer argues they didn't break the promise because they weren't the one initiating. However, going to the hotel room with someone else could still be seen as engaging in behavior that the bride considered inappropriate. The bride might feel that allowing someone else to approach the writer and then accepting the invitation is still part of hitting on someone, especially in the context of a wedding where such interactions might be frowned upon.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the wedding. The writer's ex is the groom, so the writer is there as a guest. The bride's request was direct, and respecting boundaries in such a situation is important. Even if the writer wasn't the one initiating, by accepting the invitation, they might be disregarding the bride's wishes, which could hurt her feelings or make her feel disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, if the writer wasn't actively trying to hit on people and was just being friendly, maybe the bride's reaction is a bit over the top. But the key here is that the bride made a specific request, and the writer's actions, even if not initiated by them, might still be seen as violating that request. The writer's defense that they didn't break the promise might not hold if accepting an invitation from someone else is considered part of the behavior the bride wanted to avoid.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's direct request, even if it wasn't their initiation. The bride's feelings matter here, and the writer should have been more careful to avoid any situation that could be seen as hitting on someone, regardless of who approached whom.\n"
