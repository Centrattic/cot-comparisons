It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride had explicitly told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone, just having a good time, but when a bridesmaid asked them to her hotel room, they agreed. Now the bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride set a boundary beforehand, telling the author not to hit on anyone. The author didn't explicitly reject the invitation from the bridesmaid but instead accepted it. The author argues that the girl approached him, so he didn't initiate, but the initial instruction from the bride was to not hit on anyone. \n\nThe main issue here is about respecting boundaries. Even if the author wasn't the one to approach the bridesmaid, the fact that he accepted the invitation might still be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride's perspective is important here; she asked him to avoid hitting on others, so she might feel he didn't respect her wishes, even if the other person initiated contact. \n\nAnother angle is the social context. Attending a wedding where you're close to the groom and his family, but the bride is your ex, adds complexity. The author might have thought it was okay to have fun, but the bride's discomfort is valid. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, even if unintentionally. \n\nHowever, the author didn't intentionally break the promise. They claim they weren't hitting on anyone, but accepting a hotel room invitation from someone else could be interpreted as inappropriate in that setting. The key is whether the author respected the boundaries set by the bride. Even if the other person initiated, the author's decision to accept might still be problematic. \n\nSo, considering the bride's request and the potential for the author's actions to cause offense, it's likely that the author is in the wrong. They didn't adhere to the boundary set by the bride, which led to her being upset. Even if the author didn't act on their own, accepting the invitation still violates the spirit of the bride's request. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
