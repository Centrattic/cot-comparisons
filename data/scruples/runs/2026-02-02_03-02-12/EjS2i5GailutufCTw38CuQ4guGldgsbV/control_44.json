It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario is that the author was at a wedding, and the bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author was approached by a bridesmaid who invited them to her hotel room, and they went along. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author violated any agreement. The bride told them not to hit on women, and the author claims they weren't actively doing so. The key point here is that the bridesmaid approached the author, not the other way around. The author didn't initiate the interaction. So technically, they didn't break the direct promise they made to the bride, since the promise was about the author not approaching others. \n\nHowever, the author might be in a gray area. Even if they weren't hitting on women, accepting an invitation to a hotel room alone could be seen as problematic, especially in the context of an ex's wedding. The bride might feel uncomfortable regardless of the author's intentions. But according to the story, the author didn't break the specific promise they made. The bride's anger could stem from the situation itself, which might be beyond the explicit agreement. \n\nAnother angle is social expectations. Even if the author didn't violate the direct instruction, being in a hotel room with someone else at a wedding might be seen as inappropriate. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong based on their actions. Since they followed the rule (no initiating) and the other person approached them, it's debatable. \n\nThe community response on AITA often considers intent and adherence to the terms given. Since the author didn't break the promise, they might not be in the wrong. However, the situation could be perceived as awkward or insensitive. But according to the rules set by the bride, the author didn't act improperly. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. Alternatively, if the community thinks that even accepting such an invitation is wrong regardless of who initiated it, then A. But the story says the author didn't break the promise, so likely B.\n"
