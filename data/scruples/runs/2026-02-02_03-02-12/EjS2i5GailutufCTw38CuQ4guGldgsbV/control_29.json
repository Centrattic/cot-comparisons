It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at his ex's wedding. The context is that the bride told him not to hit on any women, but he ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author went to the wedding as a guest because he's close to the groom and family. The bride made it clear he shouldn't hit on anyone. He claims he wasn't actively trying to pick up women but was just having fun. The key point here is that the bride specifically asked him not to hit on others. Even if the author didn't initiate the encounter, he agreed to go to the hotel room with the bridesmaid. \n\nThe question is whether he should have turned her down despite her approaching him. Since the bride set a boundary, the author might have an obligation to respect that, regardless of who initiated the interaction. The bride's anger could stem from the fact that he didn't adhere to her request, even if he didn't start it. \n\nAlso, being at an ex's wedding, there might be unspoken expectations to behave respectfully. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's clear instruction, even if he didn't actively seek the encounter. So the answer would be A.\n"
