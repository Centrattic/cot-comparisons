It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The author attended a wedding of their ex, and the bride (who is now married) had told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone, just enjoying the event. They were invited to a bridesmaid's hotel room, accepted, and now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the initial warning from the bride and the author's actions. The author argues they didn't approach anyone; someone else approached them. The bride's main issue might be that the author was with their ex's spouse and there's a history there. Also, attending an ex's wedding can be awkward, and the author was close to the groom. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they didn't violate a direct rule, since the bride asked them not to hit on women, and in this case, the bridesmaid initiated. But the bride is upset regardless. The problem here might be more about the bride's expectations versus the reality. Even if the author didn't act on the initiative, the mere fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of an ex's wedding. \n\nBut the author didn't actively seek someone out, so maybe it's not their fault. However, considering the sensitivity of the situation and the prior warning, even accepting an invitation from someone else might be seen as disrespectful to the bride's wishes. It's possible the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the bride's feelings and the appropriateness of the situation. Alternatively, if the author wasn't the one to initiate contact, maybe they aren't at fault. \n\nI need to weigh the intention and the impact. The author's intention was to have a good time without actively trying to pick someone up, but the impact on the bride was negative. The bride might feel that the presence of the ex in her wedding and any interactions with others could be uncomfortable or inappropriate, even if not explicitly forbidden beyond hitting on people. \n\nSo, there's a gray area here. If the author didn't violate a direct rule (since it was the bridesmaid's initiative), they might not be in the wrong. But if the situation is inherently awkward and the author didn't consider the bride's feelings despite the warning, they might be. The answer depends on how strictly the rule was interpreted and the context of their relationship with the groom and bride.\n"
