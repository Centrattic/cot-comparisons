It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on any women there. The author didn't actively try to pick up anyone but was just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the expectations set by the bride before the wedding and the author's actions. The bride asked the author not to hit on any women, which the author agreed to. However, the argument is that the author didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid did. But the author didn't refuse. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author broke the agreement. The bride's rule was to not hit on anyone, but the author didn't initiate. However, they still went to the hotel with the bridesmaid. Even if it was the other person who invited them, by accepting, the author might be seen as participating in the behavior the bride asked them to avoid. \n\nAlso, the context is a wedding of their ex. The author is close to the groom's family, so maybe the bride had a legitimate concern about causing tension or making her own event uncomfortable. The author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the other person approached them. But if the agreement was to avoid any such interactions, then accepting an invitation from someone else might still violate that. \n\nIs the author responsible for not turning down the invitation? If the bride's rule was clear, then the author should have respected that by not engaging in any form of romantic or flirtatious activity, regardless of who initiated it. The fact that the author didn't initiate doesn't necessarily absolve them if they agreed not to partake in such behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't actively seek out others, maybe their actions were within the bounds of what was acceptable. But the problem is that the bride felt violated by the interaction. The author might not see it as hitting on someone, but the bride did. So it's a matter of perspective and whether the author respected the boundaries set beforehand. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the author didn't initiate, going to a hotel room with someone else at a wedding could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the context of the ex's wedding. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for not honoring the bride's request, even if they didn't start the interaction. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't uphold the agreed-upon boundary, regardless of who initiated the contact.\n"
