It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves attending an ex's wedding, being told not to hit on any women, and then a bridesmaid inviting the person to her hotel room.\n\nFirst, the author was told by the bride beforehand not to hit on women. They claim they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone, just enjoying the event. The bridesmaid approached them, and they accepted the invitation. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions versus the initial warning. The bride set clear boundaries, but the author didn't reject the invitation. Even though the bridesmaid initiated, the author didn't decline. The bride might feel that the author didn't respect her boundaries. But was the author supposed to refuse the invitation just because the bride told them not to hit on anyone? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author was just being social and the bridesmaid approached them, maybe it's not their fault. However, the bride's request was to not hit on any women. By accepting the invitation, the author might have inadvertently crossed a line, even if they weren't the one initiating. Depending on cultural or personal expectations, the bride might see this as a breach of trust or respect. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't actively seek the attention, but the bride's perspective is valid. So, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't initiate, but maybe they should have respected the bride's request more by declining any advances. Wait, but the bride's instruction was general, not specific to the bridesmaid. If the author wasn't hitting on anyone, maybe they're in the right. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the initiative came from the bridesmaid, and the author wasn't actively seeking attention. But the bride's discomfort is understandable. Still, the author didn't violate the promise directly since they didn't approach anyone.\n"
