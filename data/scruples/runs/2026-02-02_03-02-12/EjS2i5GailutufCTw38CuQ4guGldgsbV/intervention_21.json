Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women there. The author didn't actively pursue anyone but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the key points: The bride set a boundary, the author didn't explicitly break that by initiating contact, but the invitation came from the bridesmaid. The author's reasoning is that they didn't approach the woman, so they didn't violate the rule. The bride's issue might stem from her feeling uncomfortable about any flirtation, even if not initiated by the author. \n\nNow, considering social norms. Even in a wedding, which is a social event, there's an expectation of respect. Being invited to a hotel by someone else could still be seen as crossing a line, especially if the wedding is of an ex-partner. The author might argue they were just being social, but the bride's discomfort is valid. The line between socializing and flirting can be blurry. \n\nAlso, the author was at the ex's wedding. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which is a direct instruction. Even if the author didn't approach, accepting an invitation might still be problematic. It could be perceived as taking advantage of the situation or disregarding the bride's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the contact. The bridesmaid approached them. If the author was simply being social and the invitation was unsolicited, maybe they didn't intend to violate any rules. But the bride's perspective is important here. Her discomfort is real, and the situation could damage the relationship with her family if the author is close to the groom.\n\nI need to weigh personal responsibility versus social expectations. The author might not have intended harm, but their actions (even if not initiated) contributed to the bride's upset. The answer hinges on whether accepting an invitation from someone else in that context is considered crossing a boundary. If the bride explicitly asked for no flirting, any form of socializing that could be seen as flirtatious might be an issue. The author's defense is that they didn't approach, but the outcome still upset her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a close call. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, not necessarily to avoid any social interactions. However, the hotel room invitation is a red flag. The author might argue they were just being polite, but the context of the wedding and the ex's relationship adds layers. The bride's reaction is valid, but the author didn't explicitly break the rule as stated. However, in social contexts, sometimes actions like this can be seen as inconsiderate even if not in violation of a strict rule. \n\nFinal call: The author might not be in the wrong for not rejecting an invitation, but they should consider the bride's feelings and maybe apologize to maintain good relations with the groom's family. But based on the strict terms, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with nuance. However, some might argue that accepting such an invitation in a wedding setting, especially with the bride's prior request, is crossing a line. So maybe A? Hmm. It's tricky. I think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were seen as respectful. If they were just being social and didn't push, maybe B. If the invitation was a setup and the author went along, maybe A. Since the author didn't initiate, but accepted, it's a bit ambiguous. Given that the question is about being an asshole, if the author didn't intend to harm but the action upset someone, it's a gray area. But the bride's reaction is valid, so maybe the author should have been more cautious. However, the user's initial thought is B. I'm leaning towards B as well, but it's close.\n"
