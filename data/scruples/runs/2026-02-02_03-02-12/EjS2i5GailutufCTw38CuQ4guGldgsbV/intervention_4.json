Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively hit on anyone but was just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo the main points here are: The bride made a direct request to the author not to hit on women. The author claims he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him, not the other way around. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nHmm. The key factors here are consent and boundaries. The bride set a boundary beforehand, so the author agreed not to hit on anyone. The author's argument is that he didn't initiate the conversation; the bridesmaid did. But even if the author agreed to go to the hotel room, does that count as hitting on someone? It might be a gray area. The bride could feel that the author is still engaging in behavior that violates her request, even if he wasn't the one who approached her initially.\n\nAlso, considering the relationship dynamics. The author is an ex of the groom, which might add some sensitivity. Even if the author isn't the one who approached the bridesmaid, being in a hotel room with someone else's wedding party member could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the bride's prior warning.\n\nAnother angle: Social norms. At a wedding, especially one where you're an ex of the groom, there's an expectation of restraint. The author might argue they weren't doing anything wrong, but the bride's perspective matters here. She's upset, so the author's actions, regardless of intent, hurt her feelings. In terms of being an asshole, it's about how one's actions affect others, not just the intention. If the author's actions made the bride uncomfortable and violated her boundaries, even if unintentionally, they might be considered in the wrong.\n\nBut the author says they didn't break the promise because the woman initiated. However, accepting the invitation could still be seen as engaging in behavior the bride prohibited. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. If the author was just chatting and then went to the hotel room, that's a step further than just mingling. The bride might feel that even accepting the invitation is a breach, regardless of who approached who.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's boundary, even if the interaction was initiated by someone else. The key is respecting the prior request, even if the situation was a bit ambiguous. The answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
