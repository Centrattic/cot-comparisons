It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author did something wrong by not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the ex got married, and the author attended because they're close with the groom and family. The bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author agreed but then ended up being asked out by a bridesmaid, accepted, and now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points are: the author was warned not to hit on anyone. The author says they didn't actively seek anyone out but accepted an invitation. The bride is angry, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the offer.\n\nSo, the author was given a direct instruction by the bride to not hit on women. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation might still breach that agreement. The bride's concern is likely about maintaining her wedding's decorum and her own comfort. The author's defense is that they didn't approach the bridesmaid, but the promise was to not hit on anyone, which could include accepting advances if the author is there to avoid such situations. \n\nBut the line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. If the author was simply having a good time without intent to hit on others, maybe the bride's expectation was too strict. However, since the author was explicitly told not to hit on women, their acceptance of the invitation might be seen as violating that request, even if they didn't initiate it. \n\nThe author's responsibility is to respect the bride's wishes, especially in her own wedding environment. Even if the author didn't actively seek attention, accepting an invitation from someone else could be seen as disregarding the earlier agreement. The bride's perspective is important here; her discomfort matters. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's request, regardless of who approached whom. \n\nBut there's a nuance: if the author was just socializing and the bridesmaid approached them, maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, the author could have politely declined to avoid any issues. Not turning down the invitation might be seen as not respecting the bride's boundaries. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't uphold the bride's request, leading to her upset. Even if they didn't initiate, the agreement was to avoid hitting on anyone, and accepting the invitation could be part of that.\n"
