It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride had warned the author beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, which he accepted, making the bride upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The bride made a direct request not to hit on any women. The author says they didn't initiate the contact; the bridesmaid invited them. The main issue is whether accepting that invitation violates the bride's request.\n\nThe author argues they didn't break a promise because it was the other person who approached them. But the bride's perspective is that the author was still engaging in behavior she found unacceptable, even if it wasn't the author's initiation. \n\nI have to consider social norms. At a wedding, especially one of an ex, there's an expectation to behave respectfully, even if not in a relationship. The author was there as a guest, so their actions could affect the couple's event. Even if the author wasn't hitting on someone themselves, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer. It's possible the bride feels it's a sensitive situation, and any interactions could be awkward or uncomfortable for her. The author's defense that they didn't start the interaction might not matter if the bride perceives it as a breach of her request.\n\nBut the author's position is that they didn't violate the agreement because it wasn't their initiation. However, the bride's request was likely to avoid any such situations entirely. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. The hotel room invitation could be seen as going beyond normal mingling, especially at the end of the night.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about respect for the bride's wishes. If she explicitly asked not to hit on anyone, then any interaction that could be interpreted as that\u2014even if initiated by someone else\u2014might be seen as violating that request. The author might not have intended to, but the action still caused offense. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't start the interaction.\n"
