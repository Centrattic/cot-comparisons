It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's ex got married, and he was invited. The bride told him before the wedding not to hit on any women there. He says he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, just having fun, and then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, which he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The author claims he didn't break that promise because the woman approached him, not the other way around. But the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, she might feel that even if he didn't initiate, being in a romantic situation (an ex's wedding) and accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line. It's a social situation where boundaries might be expected. Even if he wasn't actively pursuing others, responding to someone else's overture might still be problematic in that context, especially since the bride had made a specific request.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding could add to the sensitivity. The bride might feel that his presence is already a potential source of tension, so any interaction that could be seen as flirtatious or intimate might be more offensive. The author might not see it as hitting on women in the traditional sense, but the hotel room visit definitely steps into a more personal and possibly intimate space.\n\nThe author's argument is that he didn't initiate and thus didn't break the promise. But maybe the promise was to not engage in any advances or interactions that could be seen as romantic or flirtatious. A hotel room invitation is a strong overture, and accepting it could be seen as participating in something that the bride wanted to avoid. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't start it, by accepting the invitation, he's still engaging in behavior that the bride found objectionable. The bride's request was a clear boundary, and the author's actions, while perhaps not exactly what the bride meant by \"hitting on,\" might still violate the spirit of her request. \n\nIn social contexts, sometimes respecting someone's boundaries means avoiding situations that could be perceived as crossing those lines, even if technically the other person initiated. The bride's upset suggests that she felt the situation was inappropriate, and the author's acceptance might have disregarded her feelings about the event's atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's request, even if he didn't initiate the interaction. The key is whether the action (accepting the invitation) is within the promise made. If the promise was to not engage in romantic overtures, then accepting one could be seen as violating that. So, answer A (Yes) might be appropriate here.\n"
