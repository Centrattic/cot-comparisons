It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves attending an ex's wedding where the bride had told him not to hit on any women. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The bride said he shouldn't hit on any women. The author says he didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid approached him. But even if he didn't initiate, accepting an invitation to her hotel room might still be seen as going too far. The bride's request was likely to prevent any kind of advances, including mutual situations. \n\nAlso, there's the context of an ex's wedding. The presence of the ex and their family might make the situation more sensitive. Even if the author wasn't in a relationship with the bride, the bride's feelings could be hurt by someone from her partner's past engaging in such behavior, especially at their wedding. The author's actions might be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the boundaries she set. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author respect the bride's request? The author says he didn't initiate, but accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement. The bride might feel that even being approached by someone from her ex's circle is inappropriate, especially in a private setting like a hotel room. \n\nAlso, social norms might play a role here. Even if it's not a direct advance, being in a private situation with someone else's partner (even if they're divorced) can be considered inappropriate. The ex is married now, so the author's presence and actions might be affecting the new marriage's dynamics. \n\nSo, while the author didn't break the explicit rule of not initiating, the implicit understanding of the bride's request might have included avoiding any situations that could be seen as inappropriate. The author's actions might have been careless of the bride's feelings and the potential for misinterpretation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the broader implications of their actions on the bride and the wedding atmosphere.\n"
