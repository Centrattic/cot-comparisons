Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author attended their ex's wedding. They were close with the groom and the family, so attending wasn't unusual. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which the author found odd but agreed to. At the wedding, they were having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset now, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was given a direct instruction by the bride not to hit on women. But they didn't initiate any advances; instead, someone else invited them. The question is whether accepting that invitation breaches the promise made to the bride.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they didn't go out of their way to hit on anyone\u2014they were just socializing. The bridesmaid approached them. But the bride might see it as the author still engaging in behavior they shouldn't have. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting an invitation to someone's hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. The author might be in the right in not breaking a direct promise, but maybe overstepped by going to the hotel room regardless. Alternatively, maybe the bride's request was too broad, and the author wasn't actually hitting on people, just being social. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the bride's instruction was to avoid any flirting or advances, then accepting a hotel room invitation could be seen as crossing a line, even if not initiated. On the other hand, if the author didn't actively seek it out, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But I think the general social expectation is that at a wedding, especially an ex's, you should avoid any situations that could be seen as inappropriate. So the author might be in the wrong for going to the hotel room, even if the invitation wasn't their idea. The answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's request, even if it was a third party's invitation. Or maybe B (not in the wrong) if the invitation wasn't their initiation. Hmm. I'm leaning towards A because the bride's request was clear, and regardless of who initiated the hotel room thing, being there could be seen as violating that promise. So the answer is A.\n"
