Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to the wedding, and the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women. The author didn't actively hit on anyone but ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid to her hotel room. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was invited to the wedding because they were close to the groom and his family. The bride had a specific request not to hit on any women, which the author thought was strange but agreed to. However, the author claims they didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid invited them. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author break the agreement? The bride said not to hit on any women, but the author argues that the invitation was from the other person. But accepting such an invitation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement. Even if the author didn't initiate, they chose to accept the invitation, which might have been the bride's main concern. \n\nAlso, the bride is upset, so the author's actions had an impact on her. The question is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate, even if they didn't explicitly break a rule. The author's defense is that they didn't \"hit on\" anyone, but the situation could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if there's no explicit rule against it, accepting a romantic or sexual advance from someone else at a spouse's or ex's wedding might be considered inappropriate. The bride might feel that the author is disrespecting her or the event's significance. \n\nThe author's perspective is that they didn't break the promise because the other person approached them. However, the promise was to not hit on any women, and accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as participating in that behavior, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nI think the answer here hinges on whether the author respected the bride's boundaries. Even if the invitation wasn't their idea, accepting it could be seen as disregarding the bride's request. The bride might not want any romantic interactions at the wedding, and the author's choice to go to the hotel room with someone else could be considered inconsiderate or violating the trust. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's clear request, even if they didn't start the interaction themselves. The answer would be A (yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
