It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not rejecting a girl who invited him to her hotel room at his ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person attended their ex's wedding. The bride had explicitly told him not to hit on any women, which he thought was weird but agreed to. At the wedding, he's just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. When the reception is winding down, a bridesmaid invites him to her hotel room, and he agrees. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial agreement not to hit on women and the circumstances of the encounter. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for not turning down the invitation.\n\nThe bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The person in question didn't go out of his way to approach others but was approached by a bridesmaid. The argument he makes is that he didn't initiate the contact, so he didn't break his promise. However, the bride is upset either way. \n\nBut does the initial agreement cover situations where someone approaches him? If the agreement was to not hit on others, then being invited by someone else might not be considered breaking that promise. But maybe the bride's perspective is that even if he wasn't initiating, being in such a situation at her wedding, especially with a bridesmaid, is inappropriate. \n\nThe person's actions could be seen as a breach of boundaries, even if he didn't initiate the contact. The bride might feel that his acceptance of the invitation could lead to something that's unseemly for her wedding. Also, being at an ex's wedding, there's an added layer of complexity. Even if the person isn't in a relationship anymore, their actions could be perceived as disrespectful towards the current spouse, especially if the ex's spouse was explicit about wanting to avoid such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the person argues he didn't break the promise because he didn't initiate it. However, sometimes in social contexts, just being present or accepting invitations can be seen as problematic, especially if there was a prior agreement. The fact that the bride is upset regardless might indicate that the situation is sensitive, and even passive acceptance could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering the bride's explicit request and the context of her wedding, the person might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, even if he didn't actively approach someone. Accepting the invitation could be seen as contributing to the situation she wanted to avoid. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
