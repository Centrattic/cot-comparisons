It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The ex (bride) had explicitly told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset because she feels this is inappropriate.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author break their promise? The bride said to not hit on women, and the author says they didn't initiate the approach. The bridesmaid approached them. But the author accepted the invitation. So, technically, the author didn't hit on the woman; they were invited. However, the context is a wedding where the author is an ex of the bride. \n\nThe bride's perspective is important here. She might feel violated or disrespected because her ex was at her wedding and then went off with someone else. Even if the author didn't initiate, being in a hotel with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line. The author might not see it that way, thinking they were just being social. \n\nBut the initial request from the bride was for the author not to hit on anyone. If the author went to a hotel with someone else, even if not initiated by them, it could be interpreted as breaking that promise. The author might argue that the invitation was unsolicited and they didn't go looking for it, but the action still happened. \n\nAlso, the social norms around exes at weddings: there's an expectation that the ex would behave respectfully. Even if there's no legal or binding obligation, social expectations often require maintaining boundaries. The bride might feel that her request was a boundary the author crossed, regardless of how it started. \n\nAnother angle: the author is close to the groom. The groom's family is okay with the author's presence, but the bride is upset. The author might have to weigh their relationship with the groom against the bride's feelings. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the social repercussions.\n\nSo, if the author agreed to not hit on anyone and then went to a hotel with a bridesmaid, regardless of who approached first, it might be seen as violating that agreement. Even if they didn't actively flirt, the action could be interpreted as breaking the promise. The bride's anger is partly because of the breach, even if the author didn't intend to. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, even if not initiated by them, could be seen as violating the bride's wishes and the social norms of the situation.\n"
