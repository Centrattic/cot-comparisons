It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author went to their ex's wedding. The soon-to-be bride had told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they didn't go looking for attention, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an ex and is attending a wedding where they might feel a mix of emotions. The bride made a direct request not to hit on others, which the author thought was strange but agreed to. Then, the bridesmaid approached the author, not the other way around. The key point here is who initiated the interaction. The author didn't approach the bridesmaid; the bridesmaid extended an invitation. \n\nThe bride is upset, but the author argues they didn't break their promise because the invitation was from the bridesmaid. So, is the author's action wrong? Well, they followed the initial instruction not to make the first move. However, accepting the invitation could be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding. Weddings are about the bride and groom, and even though the author is an ex, their presence might be sensitive. \n\nAlso, the author was close to the groom, so maybe the bride's request was to maintain a respectful environment for the wedding. Even if the author didn't make a move, accepting an invitation from another attendee might still be inappropriate. The bride might feel disrespected because someone at her wedding was engaging in behavior that could be seen as flirty or inappropriate. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the author didn't initiate and was just responding to someone else's overture, it's a bit different. The author might argue they were just being social, not trying to cause trouble. However, in a wedding setting, there are social expectations to be considerate. Even if the invitation was from the bridesmaid, accepting it could be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes, especially if she felt it was a breach of her request.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author respected the bride's boundaries. The bride asked them not to hit on anyone, and the author claims they didn't. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room, even if initiated by another person, might still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The author's presence and actions could be causing discomfort to the bride, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't take the first step, their acceptance of the invitation might have overstepped, given the sensitive context of the ex's wedding. The bride's request was to avoid such situations, so the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that, even indirectly.\n"
