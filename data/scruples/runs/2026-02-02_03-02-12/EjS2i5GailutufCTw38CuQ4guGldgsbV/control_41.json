It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author received a direct request from the bride to not hit on anyone. The author claims they didn't initiate; the bridesmaid approached them. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nHmm. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women at her wedding. The author didn't go up to someone and try to flirt or proposition them. Instead, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. But the author is now being criticized by the bride. \n\nWait, but the bride's main concern was the author hitting on people. If the author didn't initiate, then technically they might not have broken the rule. But even if the invitation was from the bridesmaid, being in a hotel room with someone else's spouse (the bride) could be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. Maybe the bride feels it's disrespectful or that the author is still trying to interfere in her wedding in some way. \n\nAlso, the author is at an ex's wedding. Even if they were clear about not hitting on anyone, maybe the presence there is already sensitive. The bride might feel that the author's participation in the event, even as a guest, is problematic, and any interaction could be seen as violating the spirit of the request. \n\nBut the author didn't break the specific rule given, because it was the bridesmaid who initiated. So technically, the author might not be in the wrong. However, there's a social expectation that at someone else's wedding, you should behave in a way that respects the couple and their event. Even if not hitting on people, being in a private setting with a bridesmaid might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAnother angle: the bride's request was to prevent the author from making advances. If the author didn't ask for the invitation, maybe they are still complicit by accepting. It's possible that by accepting the invite, they're engaging in behavior that the bride wanted to avoid, regardless of who initiated. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the rule was to not hit on anyone, and the author didn't initiate, then maybe not. But if the bride's intention was to prevent any romantic interactions at her wedding, even if initiated by others, then the author might be seen as in the wrong. \n\nIt's tricky. The answer depends on whether the rule was strictly about initiating or about participating in any romantic activity. The author interpreted it as not initiating, but the bride might see it as the author still being involved in such behavior. \n\nIn social contexts, sometimes people expect guests to avoid any romantic interactions, even if not initiated by them, to respect the couple's event. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they should have respected the bride's broader intention, not just the literal wording. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they participated in a romantic situation at the bride's wedding, violating the spirit of the request even if not the letter.\n"
