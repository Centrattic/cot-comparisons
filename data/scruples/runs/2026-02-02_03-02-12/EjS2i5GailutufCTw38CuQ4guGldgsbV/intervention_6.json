It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is a wedding where the author attended as a guest, specifically close to the groom and his family. The bride had told him beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, just having fun. A bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the bride made a direct request to the author not to hit on women. Even if the author didn't intend to, by accepting the invitation from a bridesmaid, he might have violated that expectation. The key here is the pre-wedding conversation. The bride was clear, so the author should have respected that boundary to avoid hurting her feelings.\n\nBut wait, the author says the bride's maid initiated the invitation, not him. He didn't go out of his way to hit on her. However, the bride's request was about not hitting on any women, not about avoiding being invited. The author's action, even if reciprocated, might still be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes. The problem is that the bride's request was to prevent any advances, and accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could be perceived as participating in that behavior, even if not the instigator.\n\nAlso, the context is a wedding. The bride might feel that the author, being close to the groom, should have been more considerate. Even if the author didn't break his promise technically (since the woman approached him), the bride could still be upset because the situation is awkward and might have led others to think he was hitting on someone. The author's decision to attend the wedding with the ex and being close to the groom adds to the sensitivity.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong not because he was trying to hit on someone, but because he ignored the bride's explicit request, which shows a lack of respect for her feelings in a situation where tensions might already be high. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong, because he didn't honor the bride's wishes even if he didn't actively initiate the interaction.\n"
