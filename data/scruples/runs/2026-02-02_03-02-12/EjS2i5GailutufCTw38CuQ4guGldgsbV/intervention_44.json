It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nThe author argues two points: 1) They don't see why the bride is so bothered, and 2) They didn't break any promise since the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not the author. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know if that's a shared opinion.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Even if the author didn't make a direct approach, accepting an invitation from someone else at a wedding could be seen as inappropriate. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which might include avoiding situations where such interactions could happen. The author's actions might have caused discomfort, even if they didn't initiate the invitation. The key is whether the author respected the bride's boundaries. By going to the hotel room, they might have overstepped, regardless of who made the initial move. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the bride's feelings and the context of the event being her wedding.\n"
