Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong, and they want a yes or no answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author attended their ex's wedding, where they were close to the groom and the family. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively try to pick up anyone, just had a good time. Later, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset because of this, but the author argues that the girl approached them and they didn't make the first move.\n\nSo, the main points are: the initial warning from the bride, the author's actions (attending, socializing, being invited over), and the bride's reaction. The author is questioning whether they're in the wrong by not turning down the invitation.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. First, the bride's direct request. She told the author not to hit on any women. Even though the author didn't go out of their way to approach others, accepting an invitation from someone else might still violate that request. The key is whether the author's actions were in line with the bride's wishes. The author claims they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. However, some might argue that being in a position where someone approaches you could still be seen as encouraging or participating in what the bride asked them not to do.\n\nAnother angle is social norms and respect. Attending a wedding of an ex, especially when close to the groom, might involve certain social expectations. The bride's discomfort could stem from feeling that the author is undermining her authority as the host, or that the interaction is inappropriate given the context. Even if the author didn't have malicious intent, the action might still be perceived as crossing a boundary.\n\nAlso, the author was at their ex's wedding. There might be residual emotions or sensitivities. The bride could be feeling that the author's presence and interactions with other guests are a form of disrespect or could make others uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the interaction. They were invited by the bridesmaid, which complicates things. But perhaps the issue is that the author didn't set boundaries to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially knowing the bride's prior request. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even passively, by not declining the invitation to avoid any perception of violating the agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely didn't intend to hit on anyone and was just socializing, maybe the bride's reaction is over the top. The author argues they didn't break the promise because they didn't go out of their way. However, the acceptance of the invitation could be seen as a breach, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nSo, considering the bride's explicit request and the potential for the author's actions to cause offense, even if unintentionally, the author might be in the wrong. The key here is whether respecting the bride's wishes is important, even if the action wasn't a direct approach. The answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because they didn't honor the bride's direct request, even if they didn't initiate the interaction.\n"
