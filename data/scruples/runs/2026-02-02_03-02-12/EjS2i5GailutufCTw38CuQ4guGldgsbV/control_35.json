It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom and family. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women, but the author ended up accepting an invitation to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is upset, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for not refusing.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the context of the ex's wedding and the pre-existing agreement. The author was given a direct instruction not to hit on anyone. Even though the author claims they didn't actively seek to hit on anyone, they ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid. The bride's anger stems from her rule being broken, but the author argues that the invitation came from the other person.\n\nBut wait, the author was told not to hit on any women. So even if it was the other person's initiative, the act of accepting the invitation might still be seen as violating the agreement. The line between mutual consent and the initial instruction is a bit blurry here. The author might think that since the invitation came from the bridesmaid, they weren't \"hitting on\" someone, but the bride could see it as the author still engaging in behavior they were told not to do.\n\nAlso, the social context of a wedding is important. Weddings are often seen as a time when the guest of honor's wishes are respected. The bride making a direct request, even if it felt weird to the author, carries weight in this context. Accepting such an invitation, regardless of how it was initiated, could be seen as disregarding the bride's boundaries, especially since the author was in a position where they had a history with the groom and the family.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own actions. They mention they were \"having a good time, drinking, mingling, dancing\"\u2014all of which are normal at a wedding. However, the invitation to the hotel room might be a step too far, especially when there was a prior agreement. The author's defense is that they didn't approach the bridesmaid but were invited. However, accepting such an invitation could be interpreted as contributing to the situation they were warned against.\n\nThe potential issue here is about respecting boundaries. The bride had made her stance clear, and the author's actions, even if initiated by another, might still breach that boundary. The author might not have intended to hit on someone, but the outcome could still upset the bride, leading her to feel disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? The key is whether accepting the invitation, despite being initiated by the other person, violates the initial agreement. If the agreement was to not engage in any behavior that could be perceived as hitting on women, then accepting an invitation that could lead to that might be in violation. The bride's perspective is that the author didn't respect her wishes, which is a valid social expectation in this scenario. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring the prior agreement, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
