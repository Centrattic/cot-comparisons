It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider several angles.\n\nFirst, the bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they didn't go there to pick up anyone but ended up being invited to a hotel by a bridesmaid. The key point here is whether the author's actions violated the bride's request. The bride might be upset because even if the author didn't initiate, accepting an invitation could still be seen as hitting on someone. However, the author argues that the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. \n\nAnother angle is the context of the wedding. The author was invited because they're close to the groom, so their presence isn't inappropriate. The issue is more about the interaction with the bridesmaid. The bride's anger might stem from jealousy or a desire to maintain a certain atmosphere at her wedding. But the author didn't actively seek out the invitation. They were socializing without intent to flirt. \n\nI should also consider if there's a cultural or social norm about not hitting on people at weddings, even if you're an ex's friend. The bride's direct request might have been to prevent any such behavior, regardless of who initiates. The author might have thought they were being respectful by not initiating, but accepting an invitation could still breach that boundary.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break the promise since they weren't the one approaching. However, the line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. If the interaction escalated to a hotel room, the bride might view that as crossing a line, even if the author didn't initiate the approach. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not have actively violated the request by initiating, but accepting the invitation could still be seen as problematic. The bride's perspective is important here. If she felt her request was honored, then maybe not. But since she's upset, the author might need to reflect on whether their actions respected the boundaries she was trying to set. It's a nuanced situation, but the author's action of accepting the invitation might be considered inappropriate in this context.\n"
