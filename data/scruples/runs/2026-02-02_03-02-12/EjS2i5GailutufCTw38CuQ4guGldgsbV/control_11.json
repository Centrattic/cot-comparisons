It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wedding where the author is attending as a guest. The bride (soon to be wife of the ex) told him not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone but was just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride made a direct request that he not hit on any women. The author says he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. But the problem is whether his actions, even if they weren't aggressive, still violated the spirit of the request. \n\nSocial norms matter here. Even if he didn't initiate, going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid after the reception is likely seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. The bride's anger might stem from feeling that her boundaries were crossed. The author's argument that the woman approached him might not fully excuse the action, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior is typically frowned upon. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was drinking and mingling could be seen as contributing to the situation. Even if he didn't explicitly hit on anyone, accepting a hotel room invite from a bridesmaid could be interpreted as crossing a line. The bride's request was to avoid such situations, so by going along with it, the author may have breached the trust or respect expected in the scenario. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions likely made the bride uncomfortable and violated the boundaries set, even if he didn't directly make advances. So, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
