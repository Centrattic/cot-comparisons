It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to the wedding of their ex and the groom's family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on anyone. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was invited, so they had a reason to be there. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but the author didn't initiate the interaction\u2014the bridesmaid invited them. The author didn't break their promise, as they didn't approach someone to hit on them. However, the situation is a wedding, which is a sensitive event, especially with an ex involved. Even if the author wasn't trying to be flirtatious, the fact that they went to a hotel room with someone might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of intent. The bride's upset reaction is because she set boundaries, and the author's actions, even if not intentional, might have violated her trust. But the author argues they didn't break the specific rule, just went along with an invitation. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, while others might say they didn't violate any direct rules. Need to weigh the intent versus the action. The key points are: the author wasn't hitting on people, the invitation was from the bridesmaid, but going to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate regardless. The bride's perspective is important here. If the author respected her wishes by not initiating, but went along with someone else's invitation, it's a bit tricky. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they followed the rule as set, but the situation might have required more sensitivity. Alternatively, maybe they should have considered the bride's feelings and avoided the hotel room altogether. Hmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't violate the specific instruction given by the bride. They were invited by someone else, not initiated contact. However, the answer could depend on cultural norms and expectations around weddings. Some might argue that any romantic interaction at an ex's wedding is inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. But the question is whether the author broke the rule. The rule was not to hit on others, and the author didn't. The hotel room situation is a different matter. But if the author isn't in a relationship and it's mutual consent between them and the bridesmaid, maybe it's not their fault. Alternatively, it could be seen as insensitive given the context. I'm leaning towards B, but it's a close call. The key is the author didn't break the specific rule given by the bride, so technically they aren't in the wrong. The bride's upset might be about the outcome rather than the rule. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is B.\n"
