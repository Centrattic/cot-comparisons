It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was at their ex's wedding, and the bride had told him beforehand not to hit on any women there. But then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he went.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the bride's request and the author's actions. The bride told him not to hit on women, but the author didn't initiate the invitation; the bridesmaid did. The author argues that he didn't break the promise because she approached him. However, the bride is upset.\n\nNow, considering social norms. At a wedding, especially an ex's wedding, there's an expectation to be respectful. Even if the bride made a direct request, it's a sensitive time. The author was there to support the groom, so maybe he should have been more cautious. But did he actually hit on anyone? He was just having a good time, not actively seeking to flirt. The invitation came from the bridesmaid, and he accepted. \n\nBut the problem is that he was at his ex's wedding. Even if he didn't initiate, being in that environment and accepting an invitation could be seen as inappropriate. The bride might feel it's close enough to what she forbade. The author didn't explicitly break the rule, but maybe the action still upset her because it involved someone else at the wedding.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit ambiguous. If he didn't actively seek to hit on women, then maybe not. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. Weddings are about the couple, and any behavior that could be perceived as disrespecting the bride's wishes, even if not directly violating a specific rule, might be problematic. \n\nSo, there's a case for both sides. The author didn't break the promise explicitly, but his actions caused hurt, which is part of the \"AITA\" question. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the situation is perceived. In some views, the author isn't in the wrong. In others, he should have turned down the invitation to avoid causing offense. But I think the key here is that the bride felt violated, even if the author didn't explicitly break the rule. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong because he didn't consider the bride's feelings and his action upset her, even if it wasn't a direct violation.\n"
