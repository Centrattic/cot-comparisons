It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider different perspectives.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone and that a bridesmaid invited them over. The key points here are consent, the initial warning, and social norms.\n\nThe bride's anger might stem from the fact that the author was present at her wedding, which is a big deal. Even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, the fact that they accepted the invitation could be seen as inappropriate in her eyes. Socially, weddings are times when the focus is on the couple, and having an ex there can be awkward, especially if they're close to the groom.\n\nThe author argues that the bridesmaid initiated the interaction, so they didn't break the promise. But the original instruction was to not hit on any women, which might not be the same as not accepting an invitation. Depending on how the author interprets \"hit on,\" if it includes being pursued by others, then maybe they didn't break the rule. However, the bride might see it differently, thinking the author facilitated the interaction.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the groom's family being close to the author. The author might feel they have a right to attend and socialize, but the bride's discomfort is valid. The author's defense is that they didn't approach anyone, but accepting an invitation in that context could still be problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, while the author didn't actively solicit attention, their presence and acceptance of the invitation might have crossed a social boundary. The bride's feelings are important here, and the author might be seen as not respecting her wishes indirectly. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, since the author didn't directly hit on anyone, maybe B is the case. But the overall situation is about respecting the bride's explicit request, and even if others initiated, the author might be in the wrong for not avoiding the situation. Hmm.\n"
