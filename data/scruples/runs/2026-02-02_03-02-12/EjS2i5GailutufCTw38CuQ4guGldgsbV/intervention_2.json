It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went to a wedding of their ex, and the bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women. At the wedding, the author didn't actively try to pick up anyone, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author was warned by the bride not to hit on women. Even though they didn't go looking for someone, someone approached them and invited them. The author didn't initiate the contact here. The key point is that the bride said the author wasn't allowed to hit on any women, but the author didn't do that. The bridesmaid approached them. So maybe the problem is that the author went along with the invitation, but they didn't start it. The author might argue that they followed the rule since they didn't approach anyone.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the bride feels that even accepting such an invitation could be problematic, especially in a wedding setting where it might make her uncomfortable or cause awkwardness. The author might not see it as their fault because they didn't break the rule explicitly. However, the bride might feel that the author still violated the spirit of the request by not saying no when approached. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't initiate the interaction and didn't hit on anyone, perhaps they are not at fault. The answer might be B, No.\n"
