It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at a wedding where they were told not to hit on women.\n\nFirst, the person went to their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The writer claims that they weren't intentionally trying to hit on anyone, just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about it.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. The main points are the ex's wedding, the bride's direct request, and the subsequent interaction with the bridesmaid. The writer argues that the bridesmaid approached them, so they didn't initiate it. But the bride is upset regardless.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding where you're not in the immediate family and there's a history with the ex, there's an expectation of certain behavior. The bride's request, even if it seemed odd, was a direct boundary. By accepting the invitation, the writer might be seen as crossing that boundary, even if they didn't initiate the approach. The bride could feel disrespected or that the writer is not taking the wedding's significance seriously. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were at an ex's wedding adds another layer. Even if the writer is close with the groom, their presence might be a sensitive topic for the bride. The writer's actions could be perceived as insensitivity or disrespect towards the bride's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer didn't explicitly hit on anyone and claims they were just having a good time. The bridesmaid initiated the interaction. But the key issue is whether the writer respected the bride's wishes. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, and by accepting the invitation, even if not initiated by them, they might still be violating that boundary. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the writer might be expected to honor the bride's request to avoid causing any discomfort. The bride's reaction could be due to personal boundaries or past experiences. Even if the writer didn't break a specific promise (since the bride said \"she picked me up\"), the action might still be seen as inappropriate in that context.\n\nSo, considering social expectations and the specific request, the answer leans towards the writer being in the wrong. They didn't respect the boundary set by the bride, which led to her upset reaction. The fact that a third party initiated it doesn't absolve them of responsibility in this context.\n"
