Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person went to their ex's wedding. They were close with the groom and the family, so maybe they felt comfortable being there. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on anyone at the wedding. The author thought it was a weird request but agreed. Now, during the reception, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset about this.\n\nSo the key points here are: Did the author break their promise to the bride? The author says they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were just having fun. The bridesmaid approached them, so the author didn't initiate the contact. The bride is upset, but the author is wondering if they're wrong for not declining the invitation.\n\nNow, the moral question here is whether the author is in the wrong. From the author's perspective, they didn't go out of their way to hit on someone; it was the bridesmaid who made the move. However, the bride had explicitly asked them not to hit on anyone. Even if they didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation could still be seen as a violation of that request. The bride might feel that the author is not respecting her boundaries, even if it wasn't their initiation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they weren't trying to be inappropriate and that they were just going along with what was offered. But considering that the bride had made a direct request, the author's choice to accept the invitation could be seen as disregarding her feelings. Even if the author didn't break the promise in a strict sense (since the other person approached them), the action still upset the bride, which is a significant factor. \n\nSo, in terms of social norms, when someone sets a boundary, even if it's not a legal or enforceable one, respecting that boundary is usually expected. The author's decision to go to the hotel room might be seen as crossing that boundary, leading to the bride's anger. Therefore, even if the author didn't intend to hit on someone, the outcome was that they upset someone who had asked for their cooperation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't explicitly initiate the interaction, their acceptance of the invitation might still make them responsible for not respecting the bride's wishes. So the answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
