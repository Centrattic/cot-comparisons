It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, which upset the bride.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author says they didn't go looking for attention but were approached by the bridesmaid. The author argues they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and expectations. Weddings are supposed to be joyful events, and guests are expected to be respectful. The bride's request is about maintaining a non-competitive environment, especially with the ex's wedding. The author was at the groom's family's event, so maybe the bride felt especially protective.\n\nBut the author didn't actively hit on anyone. They were approached, and they agreed to go to the hotel. The line here is blurry. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could still be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding. The bride might feel that any such interaction could make her uncomfortable or the event less special. \n\nAlso, the author's ex is the groom, so there might be lingering feelings or the bride's sensitivity about the ex's presence. The author might not have realized the implications of their actions. While the author didn't break an explicit promise (since it was the woman's initiative), the perception and the bride's feelings matter here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and the feelings of others. The author might argue they were just being social, but the bride's perspective is valid. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions, even if not intentionally solicited, crossed a boundary set by the bride. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if the contact was initiated by another person. The bride's request was a clear boundary, and the author's acceptance of the invitation could be seen as a breach, regardless of who initiated it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
