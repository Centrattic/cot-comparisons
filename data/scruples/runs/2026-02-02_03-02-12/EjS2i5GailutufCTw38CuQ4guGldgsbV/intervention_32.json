It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was invited to the wedding by the groom, who is their ex. They mention that the soon-to-be bride told them not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they didn't make a move first; instead, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's request, the author's actions, and the perception of the situation. The author argues they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the bride is still upset. \n\nI need to consider social norms around weddings. Typically, weddings are about celebrating the couple, and guests are expected to respect the hosts. Even if the bride made a direct request, the author might feel that it's their right to socialize. However, the author's ex is married now, so maybe there's lingering sensitivity. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't initiate contact. But accepting the invitation could be seen as violating the bride's wishes, regardless of who started it. The bride might feel disrespected or that the author is disrespecting her marriage by being with another woman. Even if there's no explicit rule against it, the implicit expectation at a wedding is to be respectful to the hosts. \n\nAlso, the author's proximity to the groom and family might mean they have more responsibility to set a good example. The groom might be unaware of this situation, which could affect their relationship as well. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to cross a line, their actions could be perceived as inappropriate by the bride. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the bride's request was binding and whether social expectations were breached. \n\nIn many social contexts, respecting the hosts' wishes is expected, even if the request seems odd. The author might have thought it was okay because they didn't initiate the interaction, but the bride could see it as a violation of her boundaries. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not honoring the bride's request, even if they didn't start the interaction.\n"
