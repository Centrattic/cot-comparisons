It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at an ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the author was invited to the ex's wedding because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nNow, the key points here are the promise made by the bride and the actions taken. The author was told not to hit on women, which he agreed to. But when a bridesmaid approached him, he went along. The question is whether he broke the promise. \n\nThe author argues that he didn't initiate the contact; the bridesmaid did. But the original promise was to not hit on any women, so if he accepted the invitation, even if it wasn't him approaching her, he might still be in violation. The bride might feel that by accepting, he was participating in the same behavior he was supposed to avoid. \n\nAlso, the context is a wedding, which is a sensitive event with an ex. The author's actions could be seen as insensitivity towards the bride's feelings, especially considering the close relationship with the groom. Even if he didn't break the promise explicitly, maybe the social norms or the spirit of the agreement matters here. \n\nSo, does accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid count as hitting on someone? If the promise was to not approach anyone, then accepting might be within bounds. But if the promise was to avoid any interactions that could be seen as romantic or flirtatious, then accepting could be problematic. \n\nThe author's defense is that the woman approached him, but the bride might still feel it's his responsibility to decline to respect her wishes. Social expectations often require people to politely decline such invitations in sensitive situations to avoid causing hurt feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the author didn't initiate the contact, by accepting, he might have disregarded the bride's explicit request, which could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
