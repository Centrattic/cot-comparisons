It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario involves the author attending the wedding of their ex, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride had warned the author beforehand not to hit on any women, and the author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone. However, a bridesmaid approached the author, and he accepted the invitation to her hotel room. The bride is upset because she feels this is inappropriate, even though the author argues that the initiative came from the bridesmaid, not him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at his ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. Even though he's close to the groom, the presence of the ex and the bride's request might create tension. The bride's demand that he not hit on women is a direct boundary. The author's actions then are in question: he didn't initiate the approach, but he accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The key issue here is whether accepting an invitation from someone else counts as \"hitting on\" someone, which the bride might interpret as violating her boundary.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't go looking for someone else to approach. However, the line between social interaction and romantic pursuit can be blurry. If the author was in a public setting and someone approached him, accepting a private invitation to their hotel room could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially in the context of an ex's wedding. The bride's anger might stem from feeling that her explicit instruction wasn't respected, even if the author didn't make the first move. \n\nAdditionally, societal norms around weddings might play a role. Weddings are events where people are expected to behave respectfully towards the couple. The author's decision to go to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, even if invited, might be seen as inappropriate because it could be interpreted as trying to take advantage of the situation. The author's closeness to the groom and family might give him a certain level of acceptance, but the bride's perspective is also valid if she feels her request was not honored.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own statement about not breaking the promise. He claims the bridesmaid approached him, but the bride might argue that by not declining the invitation, he effectively went along with it, thus violating her boundary. The author's reasoning that the initiative was from the other person might not absolve him if the outcome is still seen as inappropriate within the context of the wedding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't actively seek out someone to hit on, his acceptance of the bridesmaid's invitation could be seen as disregarding the bride's request. This might lead to the conclusion that he is in the wrong (Answer A) because he didn't respect the boundary, even passively. However, if the action isn't considered hitting on, then he might not be. But given the context and the potential for misinterpretation, especially in the eyes of the bride, it's more likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
