It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: the person went to their ex's wedding, where they were close to the groom and family. The bride had previously told them not to hit on women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone but were just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted, which made the bride angry.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) The bride's direct request not to hit on women, 2) The author's actions of accepting the invitation from a bridesmaid, and 3) The author's defense that they were just having a good time and didn't initiate the interaction.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is looking for a judgment between A (yes) and B (no). \n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, the bride's request is about respecting boundaries, especially at someone else's event. Even if the author wasn't the one initiating, accepting an invitation from someone else might still be seen as crossing a line, especially given the prior warning. The fact that it's an ex's wedding adds another layer, as the author might be expected to be more considerate to avoid hurting the bride or the groom's feelings.\n\nThe author argues they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. However, the bride's issue might be with the author's presence and the potential for such interactions, regardless of who initiated it. Also, being at an ex's wedding and engaging in romantic activities could be seen as insensitive or inappropriate, regardless of the initial warnings.\n\nConsidering all that, even if the author didn't act in a way that directly violated the promise (since they were approached), the situation could still be perceived as crossing a boundary the bride set. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if they weren't the one to initiate the encounter.\n"
