It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author got invited to a wedding where they're close with the groom. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but the author didn't actually hit on anyone. Instead, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the initial request from the bride and the actions taken. The author thought the bride's demand was weird, but they didn't break the promise because the invitation came from the bridesmaid. The author's reasoning is that they didn't approach anyone, so they didn't violate any agreement. \n\nBut wait, the bride asked them not to hit on anyone. Does accepting an invitation from someone else count as hitting on them? The author might argue that they weren't the one initiating it, so they didn't break the rule. However, the bride could feel that the author was still engaging in behavior that's inappropriate for a wedding, especially where an ex is present. \n\nAlso, the context of the wedding: it's the ex's wedding, and the author is close to the groom. Even if they weren't in a relationship anymore, being at the wedding and being invited by someone else might cause awkwardness or discomfort. The author's responsibility here could be debated. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The user thinks no, but we have to consider social norms. Typically, at weddings, especially ex's weddings, people are expected to be respectful. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. The author might be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes, even if they didn't actively hit on someone. \n\nBut the author didn't break a promise because they didn't approach anyone. So maybe they are in the right. But culturally, being at a wedding and then going to a hotel room with someone could be seen as inappropriate regardless of who invited. So maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because of the context and the potential for misunderstanding, even if the direct rule wasn't broken.\n"
