It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The context provided is a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author didn't intend to hit on anyone, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset, and the author is confused because he didn't actively approach someone; the woman approached him.\n\nNow, the key points here: The bride set a boundary beforehand, which the author agreed to. The author claims he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. But even if the woman initiated, by accepting the invitation, the author might still be violating the bride's request. The author's reasoning is that since he didn't \"hit on\" anyone, it's okay. But the bride's rule was to not hit on any women, which the author might interpret as not approaching others, but the situation here is a bit different because someone approached him. However, the author's acceptance could still be seen as crossing the line, especially in the context of a wedding where boundaries are important for the bride's comfort. The author might not be malicious, but by accepting the invitation, he could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes, even if indirectly. The bride's upset is valid because it's her wedding, and she might feel uncomfortable about any interactions that could be perceived as inappropriate. The author's defense is that he wasn't the one to approach, but the action of going to the hotel with the bridesmaid might still breach the understanding given. So, whether the author is wrong depends on how strictly one interprets the bride's request and the social norms around weddings. In many cases, respecting the bride's wishes is key, even if the situation is a bit ambiguous. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the boundary, even if he didn't initiate the contact. The answer would likely be A (Yes).\n"
