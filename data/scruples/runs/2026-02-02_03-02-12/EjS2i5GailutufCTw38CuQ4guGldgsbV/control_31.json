It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about going to a wedding, getting invited by a bridesmaid to their hotel room, and the bride being upset.\n\nFirst, the writer was told not to hit on women at the wedding by the bride. The writer claims they didn't actively solicit attention, but when a bridesmaid approached them, they accepted the invitation. The key points here are the initial request from the bride and the writer's response to the bridesmaid's invitation.\n\nThe main issue is whether accepting the invitation constitutes hitting on someone. The writer argues that since the woman approached them, it's not their fault. However, the bride's perspective is important here. She asked him not to hit on any women, and by accepting the invitation, he might have violated her trust or made her feel uncomfortable. Even if the woman initiated, the writer didn't refuse, which could be seen as complicit in the bride's view. \n\nAlso, considering the context of an ex's wedding, there might be lingering sensitivities. The bride might feel that the writer's presence is already a delicate situation, and accepting such an invitation could be perceived as disrespectful or inconsiderate, regardless of who initiated it. The writer's defense about not actively seeking it out doesn't necessarily absolve them, as they still chose to accept the offer, which could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes.\n\nAnother angle is social expectations. Even if the writer didn't break the explicit promise (since the woman approached him), he might have crossed an unspoken boundary that the bride expected. The bride's upset is valid if she felt her request was ignored, even indirectly. The writer's actions, while not overtly aggressive, might still contribute to the bride's discomfort.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer's acceptance of the invitation was inconsiderate or disrespectful to the bride's wishes. If the bride specifically told him not to hit on anyone, then any scenario where he engages in behavior that could be seen as hitting on someone, even if initiated by another, could be problematic. The writer's justification that it was the woman's invitation might not fully address the bride's feelings of being disrespected.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer might not have intended to violate the promise directly, their acceptance of the invitation could be seen as a breach of the social and emotional boundaries the bride set. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
