It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them before the wedding not to hit on any women, which the author found odd but agreed to. At the reception, they're having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Then a bridesmaid invites them to her hotel room, and the author goes along.\n\nThe bride is upset because the author didn't reject the invitation. The author argues they didn't break the promise since the woman approached them, not the other way around. \n\nSo, key points: Did the author violate the agreement they made with the bride? The author didn't go out of their way to hit on someone; instead, someone else initiated the interaction. The bride's request was to not hit on women, which the author didn't do. However, the context is a wedding, and even if the author didn't initiate, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the bride's prior warning. The author's actions might have caused the bride distress, but the author didn't actively break the rule. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a gray area. On one hand, they followed the agreement by not initiating contact. On the other hand, accepting the invitation could be seen as participating in behavior the bride wanted to avoid. The intention was important here. The author wasn't trying to hit on someone, but their actions might have still upset the bride. \n\nConsidering the bride's perspective, her demand was about preventing the author from hitting on others. If the author didn't take the initiative, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the outcome is that the bride is upset. However, the author might not be at fault since they followed the agreement. So the answer might be B (No), but it's a bit nuanced. However, the community might see it as the author could have been more considerate, even if they didn't break the rule. Hmm. Maybe A? Wait, the author didn't actively hit on someone. The bridesmaid approached them. The author didn't violate the agreement. So maybe B.\n"
