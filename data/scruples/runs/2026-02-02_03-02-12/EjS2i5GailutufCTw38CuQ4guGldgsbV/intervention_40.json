It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at an ex's wedding. The author was told not to hit on anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was told not to hit on women at the wedding. He claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, just enjoying the event. The bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around. The question is whether accepting the invite makes him an asshole.\n\nThe author didn't initiate the interaction. The bridesmaid invited him. But the context is an ex's wedding where the author was given a direct warning. Even if he didn't approach her, accepting the invitation might be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride's perspective is important here. She might feel uncomfortable regardless of the author's intentions, especially since it's her wedding day. The author's actions could be seen as disregarding her feelings, even if unintentionally. \n\nBut the author argues that he didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. However, the initial instruction was to not hit on anyone. If the author's presence at the wedding was with the understanding to avoid such situations, then accepting an invitation from someone else might still be problematic. \n\nIt's a bit tricky. On one hand, the author wasn't proactive in approaching others. On the other, accepting the invitation could be seen as going against the bride's wishes. The bride's upset might be about the fact that he engaged in a romantic context at all. Whether or not the author is in the wrong depends on how strictly one interprets the warning and the sensitivity to the bride's feelings. If the author knew the bride was sensitive about this, then maybe he should have refused the invitation. But if he thought he wasn't violating the direct instruction, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer leans towards \"No\" (B) because the author didn't initiate and might not have broken the explicit rule, but there's a gray area. However, the bride's feelings are valid, so the author might share some responsibility even if he's not entirely in the wrong.\n"
