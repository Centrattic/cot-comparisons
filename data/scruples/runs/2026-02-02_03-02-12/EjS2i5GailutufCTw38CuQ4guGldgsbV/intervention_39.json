It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at his ex's wedding. The situation involves a wedding where he was invited even though he's an ex of the groom. The bride had told him beforehand not to hit on any women, but he ended up being invited to a bridesmaid's hotel room by her, not the other way around. He's questioning if he's an asshole for not rejecting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The bride gave a direct instruction not to hit on women, which he agreed to. But then, during the wedding, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. He didn't approach her; she invited him. The main issue is whether he overstepped by accepting the invitation, even if he didn't initiate it.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. Weddings are sensitive events, especially when there's a prior relationship with the groom. Even though he's an ex, attending the wedding and then engaging in flirtatious behavior could be seen as inappropriate. The bride's request, while perhaps overbearing, was made in good faith to prevent her wedding from being uncomfortable, especially since his presence might already be contentious.\n\nBut from his perspective, he didn't initiate the interaction. The bridesmaid approached him. So, if he's not the one making the move, does that absolve him? It depends on context. Even if the invitation wasn't explicitly flirtatious, it could still be seen as crossing a line in a social setting where the bride was already on edge.\n\nAnother angle: the bride's anger might stem from both his presence and the fact that he accepted the invitation. She might feel that his presence is causing discomfort to the groom or other guests, regardless of who made the move. Also, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding might make the situation more awkward, and the bride could be trying to maintain harmony.\n\nBut the author argues that he didn't break the promise since the girl approached him. However, by accepting the invitation, he's still engaging in behavior that the bride deemed unacceptable. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. If the hotel room invitation was perceived as a romantic or sexual overture, then even accepting it could be against her wishes.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a judgment call. If the bride clearly stated her boundaries and he's aware of them, then he should have respected them regardless of who initiated the interaction. By being in a hotel room alone with a bridesmaid, especially after a wedding where his presence is sensitive, he's likely overstepping. Even if he's not the one who approached her, the setting and the context make it a problematic situation.\n\nSo, while he didn't initiate the interaction, he still participated in an activity that the bride found offensive. Socially, it's about respecting the boundaries set, even if the other person crosses them. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even if he wasn't the one to make the first move.\n"
