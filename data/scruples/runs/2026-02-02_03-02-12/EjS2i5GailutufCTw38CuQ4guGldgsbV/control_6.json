It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context of the wedding, the direct request from the bride not to hit on women, and the specific situation where a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room.\n\nFirst, the author was friends with the groom and attended the wedding. The bride had explicitly told him not to hit on anyone. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up women but was just having fun. However, when the bridesmaid asked him to her hotel, he accepted. The bride is upset because he didn't reject the invitation.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author broke his promise. The bride said not to hit on anyone, but the author didn't approach her; the bridesmaid initiated. The line between \"hitting on\" and someone approaching you can be blurry. If the author accepted the invitation without initiating contact, maybe he didn't technically break the rule. However, attending the wedding with an ex and then going to a hotel room with someone else might be seen as inconsiderate, even if he didn't start it. Some might argue that he should have declined to avoid causing the bride distress. Others might say the bride's demand was unreasonable, and the author wasn't at fault since he followed her instruction passively. It depends on societal norms and how strict one considers the \"don't hit on people\" rule. If the rule was about not approaching others, then the author didn't break it. But if the rule was about avoiding any romantic situations, even if initiated by others, then he might be in the wrong. The community's answer could go either way, but I think the key point is that the bride asked him not to hit on anyone, and he didn't do that. The problem is the hotel room incident, which might be seen as crossing a boundary regardless of initiation. However, since the bridesmaid approached him, the author might argue he was just being polite. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. Alternatively, some might say it's inconsiderate regardless, making A the right choice. I need to weigh both perspectives and decide based on typical Reddit-style AITA responses. Usually, if someone follows the given rules literally and the issue is about intent or sensitivity, it's often not in the wrong. So B.\n"
