It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the author was invited because they're close with the groom and his family.\n\nFirst, the bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't break their promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around. They also think it's strange that the bride is so upset. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if I agree.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the author agreed not to hit on women, but in this case, someone else initiated the interaction. The author didn't actively seek to pick someone up but accepted a hotel room invite.\n\nEthically, the author might be in the wrong because they were explicitly asked not to hit on anyone. Even if the woman approached them, accepting the hotel room invite could be seen as going against the bride's wishes. The author's argument is that they didn't initiate, but the act of accepting might still violate the agreement. The bride's perspective is important here\u2014she might feel that any romantic attention at her wedding is inappropriate, regardless of who started it. The author's close relationship with the groom and family might add to the sensitivity of the situation. So, while the author didn't actively solicit, they did comply with an invitation that the bride found offensive. That could be seen as crossing a boundary, making the author at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to check if the agreement was mutual and if there's a cultural context where such interactions are acceptable. However, since the bride specified not to hit on anyone, even if someone else approached, the author should have respected that boundary. Hence, the answer is likely A.\n"
