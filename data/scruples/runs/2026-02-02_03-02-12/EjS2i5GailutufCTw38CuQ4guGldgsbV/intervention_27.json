It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women. The author didn't explicitly hit on anyone but was approached by a bridesmaid and went to her hotel room. The bride is upset, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for not turning the girl down.\n\nFirst, the bride made a direct request that the author not hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone but were approached. However, the key point here is whether the author's actions violated the bride's request. If the author didn't initiate any advances, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's a nuance here: even if the girl approached the author, being at a wedding where the bride had set boundaries could be a problem. The author is close to the groom and family, so maybe the bride felt it was inappropriate regardless of who made the first move. The author might argue they followed the rule because they didn't approach anyone, but the bride's perspective is that someone came to the author's room, which could still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. Also, social norms often dictate that attendees shouldn't engage in romantic or sexual activity at weddings, especially with others' friends or family. The author's decision to go to the hotel room might be seen as crossing a line, even if they didn't initiate it. The bride's reaction is about the breach of trust and setting an example, so maybe the author did overstep. However, if the author didn't explicitly break the rule (since they didn't hit on anyone), they might not be in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could depend on cultural expectations and how strictly the bride's request was meant to be followed. But considering the bride's perspective and typical social expectations, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the implied boundaries, even if they didn't directly violate the explicit rule. So I'm leaning towards A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
