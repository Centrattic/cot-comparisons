It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went to his ex's wedding, which he's close with the groom. The bride told him beforehand not to hit on any women at her wedding. But then, during the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he agreed. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, he didn't promise not to socialize or dance, just not to hit on women. The bride's request might be about him approaching others, but in this case, it was the bridesmaid who approached him. So he didn't initiate it. The question is whether agreeing to go to the hotel room counts as \"hitting on her\" or if it's just following a mutual invitation.\n\nHe says he wasn't trying to pick anyone up, just having fun. So if the bridesmaid made the move, and he accepted, maybe he's not at fault. The bride might feel that even if he didn't initiate, being in a private setting with someone else at a wedding could be seen as inappropriate, especially since he's the ex's friend. But the key point is whether he broke the specific promise he made. The bride asked him not to hit on women, and he didn't do that; he was invited by a bridesmaid. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that being in a hotel room with someone at a wedding is still hitting on her, regardless of who asked. Hmm. Need to consider social norms here. Typically, at weddings, going into a private room with someone else could be seen as crossing a line, even if not explicitly hitting on them. But the author's defense is that he didn't approach her. So it's a bit of a gray area. But based on the information, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he didn't break his promise directly. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. The bride's reaction is valid, but the author's actions might not have violated the specific agreement. So I think B is the right choice.\n"
