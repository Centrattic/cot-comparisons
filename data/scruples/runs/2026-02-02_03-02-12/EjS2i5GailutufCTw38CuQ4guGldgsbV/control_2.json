It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author attended their ex's wedding, which they were close to the groom and family. The bride told them not to hit on any women, and they agreed. Later, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, which they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author agree not to hit on anyone? Yes, the bride made that clear. But the author says they didn't initiate; the bridesmaid invited them. The question is whether accepting such an invitation violates the initial promise. \n\nSome might argue that by agreeing not to hit on women, the author should avoid any situations that could be seen as leading to that. Accepting a hotel room invitation, even if initiated by the other person, might be seen as crossing a line, especially since the bride was upset. Others might say that if the author wasn't the one approaching others, then they aren't at fault. However, the context of a wedding, especially an ex's, is tricky. There's a social expectation to be respectful towards the bride and not engage in behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of who made the first move. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break their promise because the invitation came from the bridesmaid. But the bride's request was a general one to avoid hitting on anyone, which could reasonably include avoiding situations where such interactions might occur. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement, even if they didn't initiate it. \n\nAlso, the bride's upset feeling suggests that the author's actions caused her discomfort, which is a key factor in AITA questions. So, even if technically they didn't hit on someone, their presence in a private setting with a bridesmaid could be viewed as inappropriate, given the context. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
