It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The person attended their ex's wedding, which they were close to the groom and family. The bride told them not to hit on any women before the wedding. The person claims they weren't actively hitting on anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo, the key points here. The person was told not to hit on any women. They argue that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not them. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. \n\nEven though the invitation was from the bridesmaid, by agreeing to go to her hotel room, the person is engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where such expectations are set. The bride made a direct request to avoid hitting on others, and while the person didn't initiate the approach, accepting the invitation could still be considered a breach of that promise. \n\nWeddings are sensitive events, and guests are expected to respect boundaries, especially when someone in a relationship (even if it's an ex) is present. The person might not have broken the explicit promise by not initiating, but their actions led to a situation that the bride found offensive. \n\nAlso, the person's justification that they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were just having fun might not fully address the bride's feelings. Even if unintentional, the outcome caused her distress. Socially, accepting such an invitation can be seen as disregarding the bride's request, regardless of who made the initial approach. \n\nTherefore, the person might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't initiate the interaction. They should have considered the bride's feelings and avoided a situation that could be perceived as going against her wishes.\n"
