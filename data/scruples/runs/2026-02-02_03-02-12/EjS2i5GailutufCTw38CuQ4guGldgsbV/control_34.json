It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending a wedding, not turning down a woman when invited to her hotel room, and the bride being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset because of this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the prior agreement with the bride not to hit on women, the action of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid, and the author's defense that they didn't initiate the approach.\n\nThe bride's main issue is probably that the author was at her wedding, which is a social event where such behavior might be frowned upon, even if the author wasn't the one approaching. The author might argue that they followed the rule since they didn't approach anyone, but the fact that someone approached them and they accepted could still be problematic. \n\nSocial norms at weddings usually expect attendees to be respectful of the couple. Even if the author didn't start the interaction, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as inappropriate. The bride's request in advance was a boundary, and the author crossed it by engaging in that behavior, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAlso, the author is the ex of the groom, so there's a pre-existing relationship that might complicate things. The bride's discomfort could stem from both the action itself and the author's past relationship with the groom. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's boundary. Even if they didn't initiate the contact, accepting an invitation to a hotel room at a wedding, especially an ex's wedding, is likely to be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
