It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The author attended their ex's wedding as a friend of the groom. The bride had previously told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they were just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Later, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions versus the bride's expectations. The bride specifically asked the author not to hit on anyone. The author argues that the bridesmaid initiated the invitation, so they didn't actively pursue her. But the issue is whether the author's acceptance of the invitation violated the bride's request.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, when someone explicitly asks you to refrain from a certain behavior, especially in a sensitive context like a wedding, it's generally expected to comply. Even if the other person initiates, the fact that the author didn't decline might still be seen as violating the bride's wishes. The bride's anger is likely because it's a wedding, and she wanted to avoid any awkwardness for her ex and the groom. \n\nHowever, the author might feel they were just being social and that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not them. But in social interactions, taking someone to a hotel room can be seen as moving beyond casual mingling, especially when the bride had warned against hitting on others. The line between socializing and flirting can be blurry, and the bride's perspective might be that the author crossed that line.\n\nAdditionally, considering the relationship dynamics: the author is an ex, and even though they were close to the groom, their presence might be sensitive. The bride's request could be to prevent any potential discomfort for the groom or the wedding party. The author's decision to accept the invitation despite the warning might not be in the bride's best interest, which could justify the bride's reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't actively solicit the invitation and was just being sociable, some might argue they're not at fault. But the key is the bride's explicit instruction. If the author respected her wishes, they would have avoided situations that could be perceived as hitting on someone. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room is a significant step that could easily be interpreted as violating that trust, regardless of initiation.\n\nIn many similar scenarios, people are expected to consider the feelings of others involved, especially in such a public and personal event as a wedding. The author's actions might have caused the bride distress, even if they didn't feel they broke the promise. The perception and the impact on the bride's experience are important factors here.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to cause harm, their actions could still be seen as disregarding the bride's specific request. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid.\n"
