It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The story says that the author's ex got married, and the author attended because they're close with the groom and family. Before the wedding, the bride told him not to hit on anyone. At the wedding, he's just having fun, not actively trying to flirt, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. He went, and now the bride is upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong and wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The author claims he wasn't hitting on anyone, just being social. However, the bridesmaid initiated the interaction. The key point here is whether the author was respecting the bride's boundaries. Even if the woman invited him, if the bride specifically asked him not to hit on anyone, going to a hotel room with another woman might still violate that boundary. \n\nBut the author says he didn't initiate it. However, attending the wedding of an ex and being in a situation where someone approaches him could be seen as problematic, especially given the bride's prior warning. The bride's upset might stem from feeling disrespected or that the author didn't take her request seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue he followed the rules by not initiating contact. The situation is a bit gray. If the bride was clear about not wanting any attention from him, then perhaps the author should have been cautious regardless of who approached. The fact that the bride is upset suggests that even passive acceptance might not be appropriate in her eyes. \n\nIn social situations, especially with exes, it's often about respecting the other person's comfort. If the bride felt uncomfortable, the author's choice to go along with the invitation could be seen as disregarding her feelings, even if he didn't act on his own. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A. However, the author didn't explicitly break the promise since he wasn't the one approaching. But the essence of the request might be to avoid any such interactions. \n\nSo the answer could be A because the author didn't respect the bride's boundary, even if he didn't initiate. The fact that the bride is upset matters. But if the author truly wasn't hitting on anyone and the woman approached him, maybe B. It's a tough call, but considering the bride's request and the context, A might be the right choice.\n"
