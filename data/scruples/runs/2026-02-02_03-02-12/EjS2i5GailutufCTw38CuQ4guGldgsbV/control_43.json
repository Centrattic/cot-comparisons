It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author had a direct warning from the bride before the wedding not to hit on anyone. At the wedding, he was socializing and dancing, not actively trying to pick up women, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the main point is the promise made by the author. The bride specifically told him not to hit on any women, and he agreed. Even though he claims he wasn't the one approaching, he went to the hotel with the bridesmaid. The key here is that the author didn't decline the invitation. Even if the girl initiated, he still chose to go along with it. So, he didn't honor his promise to avoid the situation entirely. \n\nThe bride's perspective is important too. She might feel that having him at the wedding was already uncomfortable, and this situation could make her feel like he's disrespecting their boundaries. Even if he didn't do anything overt, accepting the invitation might come off as crossing a line, especially from an ex's perspective. \n\nThe author argues that the girl picked him up, but the fact remains that he didn't refuse. So, he's responsible for his own actions. The bride's direct request was to avoid hitting on anyone, which includes responding to advances if he's aware of it. By going to the hotel, he didn't adhere to that agreement. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't uphold his promise, even if the other person initiated the interaction. The answer should be A.\n"
