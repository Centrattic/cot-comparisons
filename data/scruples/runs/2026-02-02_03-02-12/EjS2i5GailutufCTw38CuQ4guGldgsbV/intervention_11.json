It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is being asked whether they did something wrong by not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context and the specific actions taken.\n\nFirst, the person went to the wedding because they were close to the groom and family. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The person claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted.\n\nThe bride is upset now. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation. They argue that the bride's request was to not hit on others, but someone approached them. \n\nHmm. The main issue is whether accepting an invitation from someone else constitutes \"hitting on\" women. The bride's rule might have been to prevent the person from initiating contact, not accepting it. If the person didn't make the first move but accepted an invitation, maybe they didn't break the agreement. However, depending on the interpretation of the original rule, the bride might see any interaction as a violation. \n\nAlso, the context of the wedding and the relationship with the ex might play a role. The person's actions could be seen as insensitive, even if they didn't break a specific rule. But if the agreement was one-way (not initiating), then the person might not be wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on how the original instruction was framed. If it was about not initiating attention, then the person didn't break it. If it was a general rule to avoid any romantic interactions, then accepting an invitation might be a violation. The person's perspective is that they didn't act on their own, which could be a valid defense. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) based on the information given, as the person followed the rule as they understood it and the action was initiated by another person.\n"
