      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand it better.\n\nThe author's ex got married, and they were invited to the wedding because they're close with the groom and the family. Before the wedding, the bride told the author not to hit on any women there. The author thought it was a strange demand but agreed. At the wedding, they were having a good time, drinking, mingling, dancing. When the reception was ending, a bridesmaid asked them to their hotel room and they went. Now the bride is upset. The author is confused because they didn't approach the bridesmaid; she approached them, and they didn't break their promise. The question is whether the author is an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The key points here are the author's actions versus the bride's expectations. The bride told the author not to hit on any women. The author didn't initiate any contact but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The author claims they didn't approach anyone, so they didn't break their promise. The bride is upset, but the author is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what constitutes \"hitting on\" someone. If the author didn't initiate, but accepted an invitation to a private setting, like a hotel room, even if it was just chatting or hanging out, it might be seen as inappropriate. Weddings are events where the focus is on the couple, and guests are expected to respect their time. Even if the author is close to the groom, going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be perceived as taking advantage of the situation, especially since it's their wedding day and the bride might be particularly sensitive about such things.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't approach the woman, so it's her who \"picked\" them. But in social contexts, accepting an invitation to a private setting when the host (the bride) has explicitly asked not to hit on women could still be problematic. The line between friendly and romantic might be blurred, especially if the author is a guest of the groom. The family might have thought the author was there to support the groom, not to create any uncomfortable situations. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author was at their ex's wedding might make some people uneasy, even if the ex isn't involved. The bride could be worried about the author's intentions or the perception of them. Even if the author is just being social, entering a hotel room with someone else could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially in a context where the bride is concerned about such behavior.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might not be intentionally disrespectful, but they didn't consider the bride's feelings. The bride's request was about the author not hitting on women, which might imply that she wanted to prevent any form of romantic advancement, not just initiation. Accepting a private invitation, regardless of who initiated it, could still fulfill that request if the bride feels it's inappropriate. The author might have thought it was harmless, but the bride's perspective is important here.\n\nThere's a possibility of the author misreading the situation. Maybe the bridesmaid's invitation was just to hang out, but the author's presence in a hotel room could be misinterpreted. Even if they didn't have a romantic intent, the location and the timing (reception winding down) might be seen as sensitive. The bride might be upset because it's a private setting and could be a setup for something more, even if it's not the case.\n\nSocial norms often dictate that guests should avoid any behavior that could make the host or other guests uncomfortable. The author's actions, while not directly violating the explicit rule of not initiating, might have violated the implicit understanding of respecting the bride's wishes and the sanctity of the wedding event. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely didn't have any romantic intentions and the invitation was just to socialize. However, the context of a wedding, the bride's explicit request, and the private setting could mean that the author is inconsiderate of the bride's feelings and the potential for misinterpretation. The key is whether the author considered the bride's perspective and the appropriateness of the situation, not just whether they initiated the contact.\n"
