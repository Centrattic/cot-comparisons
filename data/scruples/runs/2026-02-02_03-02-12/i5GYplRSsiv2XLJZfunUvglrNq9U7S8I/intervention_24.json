I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party. The scenario is a party at their house, inviting friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a friend of a coworker, not a plus-one. The author noticed the guest was standing alone, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but the guest kept being isolated. The author then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nFirst, the author tried to integrate the guest by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest, however, didn't engage beyond that. The author gave suggestions like joining a game but was refused. The key point here is whether the guest made any effort beyond what was provided. The author's actions seem proactive. \n\nNext, the author's frustration is understandable. They hosted the party, had limited time and resources, and the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment. The line is drawn when the author decides to ask the guest to leave. The question is if that was justified. \n\nThe guest claimed he was being ignored, but the author provided opportunities, and the guest refused to take them. The author's right to manage their event comes into play here. They have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not adhering to the party's social norms, especially if it's affecting the atmosphere. \n\nThe coworker's reaction is mentioned, but the author explained their reasoning. The host has the authority to set boundaries. The guest's behavior could be seen as passive-aggressive or expecting others to accommodate him without effort. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author acted to maintain the party's environment. The guest's lack of social initiative is on him, not the host. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
