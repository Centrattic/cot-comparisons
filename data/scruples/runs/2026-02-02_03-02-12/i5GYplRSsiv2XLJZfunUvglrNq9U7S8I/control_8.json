I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest at their party who wasn't socializing. The situation is that a guest, who was sort of a plus-one but not officially, came alone and seemed awkward. The host tried talking to him, introduced him to a friend, but the guest kept withdrawing. Eventually, the host told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They were trying to be hospitable, made an effort to help him socialize, and when those attempts failed, they decided he wasn't making an effort. The host is responsible for the party's environment and their own time. If the guest is causing discomfort for others or not engaging, maybe it's reasonable to remove them. However, there's a consideration of whether the host was too quick to judge or if the guest had valid reasons for not socializing, like being shy, having social anxiety, or maybe not being comfortable in such settings. The host might have felt their own time was being wasted, but is it fair to kick someone out for that?\n\nThen, the coworker's reaction is important. She said it was \"shitty\" to tell him to leave, implying that the host was harsh. But the host explained the situation, and the coworker might not have understood the context. The guest's friend (the coworker) might not be the best judge here since she's close to him and could be biased.\n\nAlso, the guest was a plus-one but came separately. Maybe the host didn't expect him to be a burden, but the fact that he wasn't socializing disrupted the party. The host could have handled it more gracefully, like giving him a heads-up before asking to leave, but the core issue is whether it's justifiable to remove someone for not participating. In some cases, people might not be able to socialize due to personal issues, and forcing them to leave could be seen as rude. On the other hand, a party is a social event, and if a guest is not engaging and is passive, the host might feel they can't spend all their time managing that person's discomfort.\n\nAnother angle: the host's right to control their own party. If the guest is making the host uncomfortable by not participating and the host has made multiple attempts to include him, then the host is within their rights to ask him to leave. However, the tone and approach matter. Was the host's response considered harsh or was it a last resort?\n\nThe key points here are the number of attempts the host made to include the guest, the guest's lack of effort, and the host's responsibility to manage the party. If the host made a reasonable effort and the guest still didn't engage, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the host was abrupt, it's a different story. The post says the host told him to leave if he's just going to stand around, which sounds a bit direct. But given that it was a 20-minute span and multiple attempts, perhaps it's justified. The coworker's friend might be expecting the host to take more responsibility, but the host can't be responsible for every guest's social skills. \n\nSo, the host's actions could be seen as justified (B) because they made efforts to include the guest and had the right to ask him to leave if he wasn't participating. However, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or considered other factors. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the guest was unwilling to put in any effort, the host isn't necessarily at fault. Therefore, the answer is B for No.\n"
