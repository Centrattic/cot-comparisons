I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest from their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the context: The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, came along. The host noticed he was standing around alone. They tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up isolated again. The guest claimed no one was talking to him, but when asked where the friend was, he shrugged. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but he refused. The host then told him to leave if he wasn't going to participate. The coworker thought it was harsh, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether the host is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, hosting a party usually means creating a welcoming environment. The guest might have felt anxious or just not into socializing. Maybe he wasn't the type to approach others. The host tried to help once and then gave another suggestion. If the guest was making an effort but still struggling, kicking them out could be seen as harsh. Also, the host is the one organizing the event, so maybe they should take some responsibility for ensuring everyone feels included, even if it means more effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the host has the right to manage their party. If a guest is clearly not participating and not making an effort despite being offered help, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The host might feel they can't spend all their time baby-sitting someone. The coworker's friend might have had legitimate social anxiety or just not be interested in the party's activities. However, the host could argue that it's mutual responsibility\u2014guests should also put in some effort to engage.\n\nThe key points here are the guest's repeated lack of effort after being helped, and the host's attempts to integrate him. The host might not be wrong if they felt the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment. But there's also the consideration that social situations can be challenging for some, and the host could have offered more support. But the host might not have the time or energy to keep doing that. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they made a reasonable effort, and the guest wasn't reciprocating. The host has the right to ask someone to leave if they're not participating and causing discomfort.\n"
