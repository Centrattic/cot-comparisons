I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a party at their house, invited friends and coworkers. One guest was a plus one, but not officially. The guest came with a coworker friend. Initially, the author noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, refused to join games, and when told to mingle, he didn't. The author got annoyed, thinking the guest wanted others to make an effort for him, and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the author explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (author isn't wrong). \n\nI need to consider social norms, hospitality, and whether the author overstepped. Hosts generally have the right to ask people to leave if they're disruptive or not following the party's vibe. The guest in question was not engaging, even after being helped. The author tried multiple times to integrate him but he wasn't making an effort. The guest's behavior might be considered uncooperative or taking up the host's time unnecessarily. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the host should be more lenient, especially if the guest is a plus one and not the main invitee. Also, the coworker friend is upset, which could imply that the action was harsh. But the host's perspective is that they were managing their own event and couldn't be a personal assistant for every guest. \n\nIn similar situations, hosts often have the right to set boundaries. If a guest is not participating and is a burden, asking them to leave isn't unreasonable. The author did make efforts before deciding to ask him to leave. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
