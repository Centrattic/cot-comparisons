I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hosted the party was wrong to kick out a guest for not socializing.\n\nFirst, the host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but not as a plus one. The guest seemed awkward and was approached by the host, who tried to help him socialize by introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join activities, and the host, frustrated, told him to leave.\n\nThe host's actions here: they tried to help the guest integrate but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host felt it was necessary to maintain the party's environment. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nKey points to consider: Was the host obligated to keep the guest despite his lack of effort? The host wasn't responsible for the guest's social skills. Parties are social events, and guests are expected to participate to some extent. The host tried to facilitate interaction, and when the guest didn't engage, removing him to prevent disruption seems reasonable. However, some might argue that the host was too harsh, but given the context, the host had a right to manage their event. So, the answer is B.\n"
