I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest from their party.\n\nFirst, the setup: The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker, but they arrived separately. The guest was standing alone, approached by the host, introduced to someone with similar interests, but then went back to being alone. The host offered to join a game, but the guest refused. The host then told the guest to leave if he's just going to stand around.\n\nNow, the question is whether the host is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the host provided the guest with opportunities to socialize: talking to him, introducing him to someone, suggesting joining a game. The guest didn't take initiative beyond that. The host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere and not wanting to accommodate someone who isn't making an effort. It's their home, so they have the right to ask someone to leave if they're causing discomfort or not participating.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been genuinely shy or uncomfortable. The host might have overreacted, assuming the guest was being difficult rather than offering more support. Maybe the guest needed more help to integrate, and the host gave up too quickly. Also, the coworker who was the guest's friend might feel offended that their friend was sent away.\n\nBut the host did make initial efforts to include the guest. If the guest still refused to engage, maybe the host is within their rights to ask them to leave, especially if they felt it was affecting the party's vibe. The host might not be obligated to force social interaction. However, the approach of directly telling someone to leave could be seen as harsh, even if justified. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the host should have given more time or tried different methods to help the guest mingle. However, the host did make multiple attempts. It's a balance between being considerate and maintaining the environment they want for their party.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the host isn't in the wrong. They made efforts, and after the guest didn't respond, they had to set a boundary. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
