I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. First, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe author hosted a party, invited friends and coworkers, and included a guest who was a plus one but not officially invited. The guest initially seemed awkward, and the author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. However, the guest became isolated again and refused to engage in activities when suggested. The author felt annoyed and eventually told the guest to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize. The coworker who was with the guest later criticized the author, but the author defended their decision.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the guest wasn't an official invitee, the author made efforts to help him integrate, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The author's responsibility as a host is to manage the event, and if a guest is causing discomfort or not contributing to a positive environment, they might have a right to ask them to leave. However, it's also important to consider the guest's feelings and possible social anxiety. But the guest did have opportunities to engage and refused, which might justify the author's actions. The coworker's disapproval is another angle, but the author explained their reasoning. It's a balance between hospitality and the host's right to set boundaries. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest didn't make an effort. Answer B.\n"
