I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but ended up being isolated. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but the guest didn't engage and kept standing alone. The host got annoyed and asked him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They have a party, so they might reasonably expect guests to participate or at least make an effort. The guest was given opportunities to socialize but refused. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't respond. The host's frustration led them to ask the guest to leave, which might be seen as reasonable since the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the host could be seen as being too quick to judge. Maybe the guest was just shy or anxious. But the host did make attempts to include him. The guest's refusal to engage in games or approach others might indicate that he wasn't interested in participating, so the host isn't entirely at fault. Also, the host mentioned not having time to drag him around, which is a valid point since they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions.\n\nThe coworker friend thought it was \"shitty,\" but the host explained the situation. It's possible that the host was in their right to set boundaries, especially if the guest was not making any effort. The key factors here are the guest's lack of initiative and the host's attempts to help. Since the guest didn't engage despite opportunities, the host's decision might be justified. So, the answer might be B (No, the host is not in the wrong).\n"
