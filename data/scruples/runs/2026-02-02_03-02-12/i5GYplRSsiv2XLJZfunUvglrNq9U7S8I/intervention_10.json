I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but came separately, was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, and suggesting activities, but the guest kept being unresponsive. Eventually, the host told him to leave if he wasn't going to engage.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the host do something wrong by asking the guest to leave? The host tried multiple times to help the guest integrate, but the guest didn't make an effort. The host felt it was their responsibility to manage the event and couldn't spend all their time assisting this one person.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, hosts do have a responsibility to make guests feel welcome. However, guests also have a role to play in engaging. If someone is being passive and not making an effort to interact despite help, the host might feel it's necessary to set boundaries, especially if it affects their own ability to enjoy the party or manage the event.\n\nBut wait, is it the host's responsibility to force socialization? Sometimes people might feel awkward, and it's not always about the guest being inconsiderate. The guest might have anxiety or other reasons for not engaging. But the host tried to help, and the guest refused every offer. In that case, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave to prevent them from disrupting the event.\n\nThe coworker (the friend who brought the guest) was upset, but the host explained the situation. So, the host might not be in the wrong because they attempted to assist and the guest wasn't cooperative. However, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or found another solution. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the balance of responsibility. Since the host made efforts and the guest was unresponsive, the host might be in the right. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
