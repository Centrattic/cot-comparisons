I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The writer hosted a party, invited friends and coworkers, and noticed that one guest was standing around awkwardly. They tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up alone again and refused to mingle or join a game. The writer then told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guest was invited, perhaps as a plus one but not officially. The writer tried a couple of times to help him integrate but found that the guest wasn't making an effort. The writer's reasoning is that the guest wanted attention but wasn't willing to socialize. \n\nThe key points here are the guest's behavior and the host's responsibility. The host did make attempts to help, but the guest didn't engage. The host's party is their space, so they have the right to set boundaries. However, kicking someone out can be seen as harsh. But the guest was a guest, not a close friend or family. The host might feel responsible for the atmosphere of the party. If the guest was making the host uncomfortable by not socializing and not taking initiative, then the host's decision might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or had personal reasons for not engaging. The host's approach might have been abrupt. But the host tried a couple of times to help. If the guest is not making an effort to socialize despite the host's help, it's possible that the host isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, and I need to decide whether to answer A or B. Considering the host's attempts to assist and the guest's lack of effort, the host might be justified in asking him to leave, especially if the party was supposed to be a social event and the guest wasn't contributing to the atmosphere. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
