I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosted a party, had a guest who was a plus one but not officially. The guest stood around awkwardly, said no one was talking to him. The author tried a couple of times to help him connect, but he didn't engage. Then the author told him to leave. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here: was the guest actually being ignored, or was he not making an effort? The author helped by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up isolated again. When the author suggested joining a game or mingling, he refused. The author got annoyed and asked him to leave.\n\nIn social situations, hosts often have the right to manage their event. If a guest is not participating and is being uncooperative, maybe the host can ask them to leave. But there's also the aspect of being considerate. Did the author give enough chances? They tried twice. Maybe the guest was shy, or had social anxiety. But the author felt the guest was not making an effort and wanted to feel sorry for himself. \n\nOn the other hand, the host's responsibility is to their own event. If the guest is causing discomfort or not respecting the social environment, the host can set boundaries. The author explained their reasoning to the coworker. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The guest might have been expecting others to approach him, but in parties, people usually need to initiate conversations. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong. They tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate. The host has the right to enforce social expectations. So answer B.\n"
