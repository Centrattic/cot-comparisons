I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't explicitly invited. The host noticed the guest was acting awkwardly. They tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest's friend was there, but they came separately. The guest kept standing alone even after being introduced. The host got annoyed, told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the host was wrong. Let's consider the host's perspective. They were trying to be helpful by engaging the guest and introducing him to others. The guest, however, didn't make an effort to socialize further. The host might feel responsible for the atmosphere but also have limits on how much they can do for a guest they didn't personally invite. The guest wasn't following up on the opportunities provided, leading the host to believe he was being passive.\n\nFrom the guest's side, he might have felt awkward or anxious, which is common in social situations. But he did reach out to the host for help twice. The host's response was to push him to interact, which the guest refused. The host then decided he should leave, which the coworker found harsh. The coworker's disapproval might add pressure, but the host's actions were based on the guest's lack of effort.\n\nI think the key points are the guest's repeated lack of initiative and the host's attempts to help. The host isn't obligated to force social interaction, especially if it's affecting the party's vibe. However, the guest might not have been in the wrong for being shy, but the host's decision to kick him out could be seen as a boundary that's reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer might be that the host isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed, like if the guest had a valid reason for not engaging, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The host acted after several attempts to assist, so they might not be at fault.\n"
