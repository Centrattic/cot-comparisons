I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is described as a party where the guest was a plus-one but wasn't really invited. The guest seemed awkward, approached the host twice for help, and when suggestions were made, he refused to engage. The host then told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus-one but came separately. The host made efforts to help the guest integrate by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. However, the guest didn't take initiative after that. The host got annoyed because the guest was passive and perhaps expecting others to make an effort. The host then asked him to leave, which the guest did. The coworker (the host's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained the reasoning.\n\nNow, the question is whether the host was in the wrong. The key factors here might be the guest's behavior versus the host's responsibility. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't make an effort beyond being passive. The host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere and their own experience. However, asking someone to leave could be seen as harsh if the guest was just shy or not social. On the other hand, if the guest was intentionally not engaging despite opportunities, the host might feel justified.\n\nI should also consider social norms. Hosts often have a duty to ensure their event runs smoothly, but they aren't obligated to force interactions. If the guest was causing discomfort by being a wallflower, the host might think it's better to remove them. However, the host's action could be seen as abrupt. But the guest was given multiple chances, and when he didn't take initiative, the host had the right to set boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the guest had valid reasons for being shy or anxious. The host's approach could be seen as harsh if they didn't consider that. But the host also has the right to their own party's environment. The guest wasn't causing harm, just not participating, so kicking him out might be excessive. However, if the host felt it was necessary for their own comfort and the party's flow, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, the host's perspective is considered, and if they've made reasonable attempts to include someone who isn't trying, they might be justified. The fact that the guest was a plus-one and not an official invitee might also play a role. The host might not feel responsible for ensuring his social interaction. So overall, the host's action, while perhaps harsh, might not be in the wrong because they tried and the guest didn't reciprocate effort.\n"
