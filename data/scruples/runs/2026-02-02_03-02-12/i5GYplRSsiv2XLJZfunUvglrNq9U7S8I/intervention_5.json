I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe host had a party and a guest who was a plus one but came separately. The guest seemed awkward and said no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. They talked briefly, but then the guest was alone again. The host offered to join a game, but he refused. The host then told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker thought it was bad, but the host argued that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the host overstepped. The guest was a plus one, which might not be a guaranteed invite. The host did try to help him integrate, but the guest didn't take initiative. The host's annoyance is understandable if they're managing the party. However, kicking someone out might be seen as harsh. But the host also set the tone for the party's social expectations. If the guest was uncooperative, maybe the host was within their rights to enforce social participation. On the other hand, maybe the host should have handled it more gently. But the host did make efforts first. So, I think the host isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
