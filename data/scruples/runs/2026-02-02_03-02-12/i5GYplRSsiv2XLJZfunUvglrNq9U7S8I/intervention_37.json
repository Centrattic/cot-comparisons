I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the host kicked a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one, came separately, and kept saying no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to others, but he refused to engage and eventually got sent home. The host is wondering if that was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They had a party, set up for socializing, and one guest wasn't participating. The host made multiple attempts to integrate the guest\u2014talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities. But the guest didn't take initiative. The host might feel that their time and effort are limited, and they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions indefinitely.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or out of place. Maybe he wasn't comfortable in social settings or at the party. The host's response of telling him to leave might come off as harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely struggling. The coworker (his friend) thought it was \"shitty,\" implying that maybe the host was too quick to judge or lacked empathy.\n\nBut the host also sets boundaries. If the guest isn't making an effort, maybe the host isn't obligated to force interactions. Parties are social events, and guests are expected to participate to some extent. The host might have a right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the atmosphere and are causing disruption.\n\nThe key points are: Did the host give enough support? Was the guest given enough time to adjust? Did the host handle it respectfully? The host tried multiple times to assist, but the guest rejected the offers. At some point, the host might have a right to say that if you're not participating, you're not the right fit for the event. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like giving a final warning before asking to leave, or being more understanding of the guest's possible anxiety.\n\nThe coworker's reaction suggests that the host's approach was too direct. But the host might feel they've done their part. It's a bit of a gray area. In terms of responsibility, the host isn't obligated to force socialization. However, the approach could be seen as abrupt. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations. In many social circles, the host might not be in the wrong if they've made reasonable efforts and the guest isn't engaging. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
