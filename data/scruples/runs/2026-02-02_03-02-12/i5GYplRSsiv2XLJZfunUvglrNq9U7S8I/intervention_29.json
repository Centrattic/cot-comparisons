I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who hosted the party did the right thing by kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The host tried to help the guest by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, and suggesting activities like UNO, but the guest kept standing alone. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (the guest's plus one) thought it was shitty, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They invited people to a social event where interaction is expected. The guest didn't make an effort beyond what was offered. The host tried multiple times to integrate him. The guest's refusal to engage could disrupt the atmosphere. However, kicking someone out might seem harsh, but the host has the right to maintain the environment they created. The key points are the host's attempts to help and the guest's lack of initiative. The coworker's reaction is a point against the host, but maybe the host was justified in protecting their event. So, probably answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
