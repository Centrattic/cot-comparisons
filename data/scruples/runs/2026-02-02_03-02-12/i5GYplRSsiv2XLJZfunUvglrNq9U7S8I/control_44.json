I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but came separately, kept standing around and saying no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests and suggested joining a game, but he refused both times. Then the host told him to leave if he's just going to stand around. The guest left, and the host's coworker (his friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, the key points are: the guest was invited, but didn't engage. The host made efforts to include him. The guest refused to participate even after being helped. Host got annoyed and asked him to leave. Now, the question is whether the host is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when you host a party, there's an expectation that guests will participate to some extent. If someone is being a wallflower and not making an effort, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The host tried to help by introducing and suggesting activities, but the guest didn't take the initiative. The host didn't kick him out immediately but gave him a chance after multiple refusals. The coworker might be upset, but the host's reasoning is that they can't be responsible for the guest's social approach.\n\nPossible angles: Was the host too harsh? Maybe the guest is shy or had a bad day. But the guest was given opportunities to engage and turned them down. The host's responsibility is to manage their own event and not be taken advantage of. On the other hand, maybe the host could have been more patient or found another way to include him without confrontation.\n\nLegally, I don't think the host did anything wrong. Socially, it's a bit of a gray area. The host might have overstepped by directly asking him to leave, but the guest wasn't contributing and was possibly freeloading. The host's main duty is to their own guests and environment, so if someone is not part of the social interaction, it's not unreasonable to ask them to leave after attempts to include them.\n\nAlso, the guest was a \"plus one not really,\" meaning he wasn't officially invited but came along. If the host didn't have to invite him, maybe it's acceptable to remove him if he's not engaging. The coworker might feel bad, but the host has the right to enforce party etiquette.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the host made efforts to include the guest, and after repeated refusals, it's reasonable to ask someone to leave if they're not participating and are affecting the party atmosphere.\n"
