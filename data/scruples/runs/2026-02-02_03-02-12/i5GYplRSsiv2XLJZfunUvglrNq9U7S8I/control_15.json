I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author hosted a party and noticed a guest (a plus-one of a coworker) who was standing around awkwardly. The author tried to help by introducing them to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up isolated again. When the author suggested joining a game or mingling, the guest refused. The author then told them to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author was in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. The guest was a plus-one but came separately. The author tried to help by engaging them and introducing them to someone. The guest, however, didn't make an effort beyond what the host did, and when given options to participate, they refused. The author felt that the guest was being passive and expecting others to make an effort, so they asked them to leave.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were hosting a social event and expected guests to participate. They made an effort to include the guest but weren't willing to do all the work. The guest's refusal to engage might have been frustrating, leading to the author's decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been shy or uncomfortable, and maybe they needed more encouragement. However, the author did try a couple of times. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect guests to make an effort to socialize at their own party. If the guest is a plus-one and not part of the original invite, perhaps their presence was less expected. The author might feel responsible for the overall atmosphere and not wanting to accommodate someone who's not contributing to the social aspect.\n\nIn similar situations, people often expect guests to at least make an effort to mingle. If someone is completely passive and refuses to participate, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting the host's experience. The coworker friend was upset, but the author explained their reasoning. It's a balance between being considerate and maintaining the event's social environment. Since the author tried to help and the guest didn't reciprocate, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
