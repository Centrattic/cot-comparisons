I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guest at a party being kicked out for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party, and a guest was invited by a coworker. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, suggesting activities like joining a game. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend of the host thought it was harsh, but the host justified it because the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, I need to analyze who's at fault here. The host tried multiple times to integrate the guest. They asked if everything was okay, talked to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests, and suggested activities. The guest, however, kept refusing to engage and then blamed others for not talking to him. The host's party has its own dynamics, and it's reasonable for the host to set boundaries, especially if they're managing the event and can't cater to every individual's comfort level.\n\nBut wait, did the host go too far? The guest might have been genuinely struggling socially, maybe due to shyness or anxiety. The host's response was to kick them out, which could be seen as harsh. However, the host also tried to assist multiple times before taking that step. The key point is whether the guest made an effort. The guest refused to join activities and didn't approach others, so maybe the host is justified in asking them to leave if they're not participating and are affecting the atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or found another solution. But the host's time and energy are limited, and it's their party. They have the right to set expectations for guests. The guest's behavior could be seen as passive-aggressive or manipulative, expecting others to make the effort to include them.\n\nConsidering all that, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. They took steps to help the guest, and when those failed, they made a decision to maintain the party's environment. The guest might be in the wrong for not making an effort. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
