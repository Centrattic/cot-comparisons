I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest kept isolating himself. The host got annoyed and told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. It's common for hosts to want everyone to have a good time, but they might not be responsible for forcing socialization. The guest was an uninvited plus one, which might make the host feel less obligated. The host made several attempts to include the guest, which shows effort. However, the guest refused to engage, leading the host to feel it's no longer a good fit.\n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out can be harsh. The host might have alternatives, like offering to talk to them or giving them space. But the guest's behavior could be seen as uncooperative. The host's primary role is to manage their own event and ensure comfort for attendees. If one person is causing discomfort or not respecting the event's social dynamics, the host has the right to remove them. \n\nThe coworker friend's reaction is also a point. She thought it was bad, but the host explained the situation. The host's decision to prioritize the event's flow over accommodating one guest's discomfort might be justified. However, there's a line between being firm and being rude. The host could have handled it more gracefully, but the core issue is the guest's lack of effort. \n\nSo, the host isn't entirely in the wrong because they tried to help and had the right to enforce some social boundaries. The guest's responsibility to engage is important in a social setting. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
