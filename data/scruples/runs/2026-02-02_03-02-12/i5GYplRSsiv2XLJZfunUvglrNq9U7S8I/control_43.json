I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest was brought by a coworker but came separately. The guest seemed awkward and not socializing. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. When the guest again stood alone and refused to mingle, the host kicked him out. The coworker was upset about it.\n\nFirst, the host made an effort to include the guest. They asked if he was okay, introduced him, and suggested joining a game. So the host isn't just immediately dismissing him. The guest, on the other hand, didn't reciprocate the effort. After being introduced and given options, he didn't engage further. The host might have felt it was a waste of time to continue trying if the guest wasn't making any effort. \n\nBut is it wrong to ask someone to leave if they're not participating? Hosting a party involves managing the environment. If someone is unresponsive and making the host uncomfortable, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, some might argue that the host should be more accommodating or that the guest had a legitimate reason for being shy. But the guest's own friend (the coworker) didn't have a problem with the host's actions once the situation was explained. \n\nThe key here is mutual effort. The host did their part; the guest didn't. So the host isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
