I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a party and a guest who kept being awkward. The guest was a plus one but not officially. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But the guest kept standing around alone again, refused to join activities, and didn't make an effort to socialize. The author then told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) thought it was bad. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and what's expected at a party. As a host, the author is responsible for making guests comfortable, but guests also have a responsibility to make an effort to socialize. The guest in question didn't seem to make any effort beyond complaining about being ignored. The author tried multiple times to help, but the guest wasn't engaging. \n\nNow, the key points here: The author made efforts to include the guest, but when those failed and the guest continued to act as if others weren't trying to include him, the author decided to ask him to leave. The coworker is upset, but maybe that's because they believe the guest was just being shy or awkward, not intentionally uncooperative. \n\nIs it reasonable for the host to ask someone to leave if they aren't making an effort to socialize? Hosts do have the right to enforce some level of behavior. If someone is causing trouble or not respecting the event, they can be asked to leave. However, in this case, the guest was just being awkward. But the guest was passive, not disruptive. So the line is a bit blurry. \n\nOn one hand, the author tried to help, but when the guest didn't respond, maybe it's reasonable to cut their losses. On the other hand, telling someone to leave can be harsh, especially if they're just shy. The author might have been inconsiderate, but the guest wasn't trying either. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made efforts to help, and the guest didn't reciprocate. The host can't be responsible for every guest's social skills. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
