I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the situation: The party was at the author's house. They invited friends and coworkers. One guest, a friend of a coworker, came along but wasn't exactly a plus one. The author noticed the guest was awkward, tried to help by introducing them to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept isolating himself. Despite being offered to join a game, the guest refused. The author then told them to leave.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. They tried to help, but the guest kept rejecting the opportunities. The author felt it was their right to remove someone who wasn't contributing to the social environment and was perhaps being passive-aggressive about their loneliness.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Host's Responsibility**: As the host, the author is responsible for the atmosphere of their party. If a guest is making the event uncomfortable or not engaging, removing them might be justified. However, the line between being a free host and being overly controlling can be thin.\n\n2. **Guest Behavior**: The guest seems to be struggling socially. Maybe they were shy or had social anxiety. The author's attempts to help were made, but the guest didn't reciprocate. However, forcing someone to leave for not being outgoing enough might be harsh.\n\n3. **Context and Intentions**: The guest claimed not to be talked to, but the author noticed they had been. The author might have felt the guest was being dramatic or not putting in effort. However, the guest's experience of feeling ignored might still be valid from their perspective.\n\n4. **Social Norms**: Is it acceptable to kick someone out for not socializing? Some might say it's the host's right, others might see it as insensitive. The key is whether the author gave enough opportunities for the guest to engage and if the guest was disruptive.\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions**: Could the author have handled it differently? Maybe giving more time, offering to help integrate, or talking privately. But the author felt it was taking too much of their time and effort.\n\nIn many social situations, hosts have the right to protect the comfort of all guests. If someone is making the host uncomfortable or isn't contributing to the event's social environment, removing them isn't automatically wrong. However, the decision might depend on cultural norms and the expectations set when inviting people. Since the guest wasn't a close friend and was a plus one, the author might feel less obligation. The coworker friend's reaction is interesting\u2014she called it shitty, but the author defended their reasoning. \n\nPotential issues with the author's approach: Maybe the guest was genuinely struggling, and the author could have handled it with more empathy. But the author did make several attempts to help. The guest's refusal to engage might have justified the author's decision to end the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for debate, the author's actions might be seen as within their rights as the host, especially after multiple failed attempts to assist the guest. The answer hinges on balancing the host's control over their event with the guest's social challenges.\n"
