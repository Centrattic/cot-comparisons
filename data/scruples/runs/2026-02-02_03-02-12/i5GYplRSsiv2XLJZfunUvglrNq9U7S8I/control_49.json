I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe host had a party, and a guest came along as a plus one but wasn't explicitly invited. The host noticed the guest was standing around alone and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest said no one was talking to him, even after being introduced and suggested to join a game. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort and told him to leave. The coworker friend later criticized the host for this.\n\nSo, the key points here: the guest wasn't an official invitee, the host made attempts to help him socialize, but the guest didn't engage. The host's frustration led to asking him to leave. \n\nNow, considering social norms, hosts generally expect guests to make some effort to socialize. If someone is a plus one but not invited themselves, maybe the host isn't obligated to ensure their entertainment. The host tried twice to help, and the guest didn't take initiative. The host might feel it's unreasonable to spend time dragging someone around. However, telling someone to leave could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely trying but struggling. But in this case, the guest was given opportunities and chose not to engage. \n\nThe coworker (the friend) criticized the host, but maybe she's defensive of her friend. The host's main point is that the guest didn't make an effort, so the host isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So, I think the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
