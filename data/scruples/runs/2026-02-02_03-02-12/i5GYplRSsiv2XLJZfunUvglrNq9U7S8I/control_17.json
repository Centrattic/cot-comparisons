I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing. The user is asking if they are at fault.\n\nFirst, the guest in question was a plus one for a coworker. The author noticed him being awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But the guest kept standing alone, even after being introduced. The author tried to suggest activities like joining a game, but the guest refused. Then the author got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the author made an effort to include the guest, the guest didn't take the initiative to socialize, and the author felt it was their responsibility to manage the party environment. \n\nOn one hand, parties are social events, and guests are expected to engage. If someone isn't making an effort, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it affects the atmosphere. The author tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or uncomfortable. The author could have handled it more gently, like checking in again or giving more time. But the guest was given multiple chances. The author's party, their rules, right? They have the right to set boundaries for their event. \n\nThe coworker friend thought it was mean, but the author explained their reasoning. It's possible the guest expected more from others without putting in effort. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they addressed the issue and tried to help before deciding to ask the guest to leave. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they made efforts to include the guest and the guest didn't contribute to socializing. The host has the right to remove someone who isn't engaging and is disrupting the party vibe.\n"
