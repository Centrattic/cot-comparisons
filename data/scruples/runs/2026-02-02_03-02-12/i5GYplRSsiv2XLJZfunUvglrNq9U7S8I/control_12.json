I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came along as a plus one but not really, since he was a friend of a coworker. The host noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly. They tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, suggesting a game, but the guest refused each time. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker was upset about it.\n\nSo, the host's side is that they tried to include the guest, but when he didn't make an effort to socialize, they decided he should leave. The coworker thought it was bad to tell him to leave. The host argues that they can't be responsible for making everyone talk.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let's think about the responsibilities here. As a host, they're expected to make guests feel welcome. However, the guest in question didn't take initiative. The host did make an effort to help him, but after repeated refusals, maybe they had the right to ask him to leave. The host isn't obligated to force social interaction. On the other hand, kicking someone out might seem harsh, but maybe it's justified if they're not participating and disrupting the party's vibe. The coworker's judgment might be influenced by their personal relationship with the guest, while the host is managing their own event. It's a balance between hospitality and the host's right to set boundaries. The guest's lack of effort is a key point here. So, the answer might lean towards the host not being in the wrong because they provided opportunities and the guest didn't take them. But maybe there's a more considerate way to handle it. However, given the options, the host's actions could be seen as reasonable.\n"
