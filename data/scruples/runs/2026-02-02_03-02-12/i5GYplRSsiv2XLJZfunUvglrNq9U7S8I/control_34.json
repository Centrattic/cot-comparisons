I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Hmm.\n\nSo the situation is that the guest was brought along by a coworker's friend, but wasn't really a plus one. The author noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting games. But the guest kept being alone again. The author got annoyed because the guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even though they had offered help. Then the author told him to leave, and the coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the author's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author made an effort to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, didn't engage and kept isolating himself. The author's party was for friends and coworkers, so it's a social event where interaction is expected. But maybe the guest was introverted or uncomfortable.\n\nIs it fair to kick someone out for not socializing? Well, if the party is a social event, then expecting guests to participate is reasonable. But maybe the guest had a right to just be there without interacting. However, the author tried to help multiple times. If the guest continued to not make an effort, maybe the author was justified in setting boundaries.\n\nThe coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the author explained the reasoning. So, is the author in the wrong? If the guest was a plus one, maybe not. But since the guest was not a plus one and the author had other guests to attend to, perhaps the author didn't overstep. The key is whether the guest was being disruptive or not. Since the guest was just standing around and not causing trouble, maybe the author's response was too harsh. But the author tried to help and the guest didn't reciprocate, so maybe it's understandable. \n\nHmm, I think it's a judgment call. But in terms of social norms, expecting someone to socialize might be too much. However, the author wasn't forcing them, but tried to help. If the guest was making the author uncomfortable by not engaging, maybe the author is within their rights to ask them to leave, especially if they're not contributing to the party. On the other hand, maybe the author should have been more patient. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They tried their best to include the guest, and when the guest didn't make an effort, it's reasonable to set boundaries. Also, the party was the author's space, so they can manage the environment as they see fit. The guest might have a different perspective, but the author's actions were in response to the guest's lack of engagement.\n"
