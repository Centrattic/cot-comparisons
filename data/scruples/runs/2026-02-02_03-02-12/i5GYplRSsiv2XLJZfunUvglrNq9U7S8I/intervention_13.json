I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing. So the situation is they had a party and a guest who kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced to people and given suggestions. The author told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. When that didn't work, the guest still stood around. The author got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for kicking him out.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author organized the party and has the right to set some boundaries. If someone is being a burden by not participating and expecting others to approach them, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave. On the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely shy and couldn't approach others, even if the author was giving suggestions. But the guest did have someone approach him and then ignored the introduction.\n\nAlso, the author's coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty. But the author explained the situation. Maybe the coworker didn't realize the guest wasn't making an effort. The key here is whether the author overstepped by asking him to leave. Since the guest wasn't causing a disturbance but just not engaging, is that a valid reason?\n\nIn social events, hosts often have to manage the environment. If someone is disruptive or problematic, they can be asked to leave. But this guest wasn't disruptive; he was just not socializing. However, maybe the author felt that the guest's behavior was affecting the party's vibe. The author tried multiple times to help but the guest didn't reciprocate. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the guest had a right to be there and not be forced to socialize, but the author's party is their space. \n\nI think the author's actions were justified because they made reasonable efforts to include the guest, and when those didn't work, they set a boundary. The guest's refusal to engage after being offered help might have given the author the right to ask them to leave. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
