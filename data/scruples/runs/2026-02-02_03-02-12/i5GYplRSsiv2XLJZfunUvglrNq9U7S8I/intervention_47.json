I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one, came separately, and kept standing around saying no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up alone again. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, the host's responsibility: when you host a party, you want everyone to enjoy themselves, but you also have the right to set boundaries. The guest was invited as a plus one, but maybe not officially. The host tried to help by engaging the guest and introducing him to someone else. However, the guest didn't make an effort to socialize after that. The host's frustration comes from the guest expecting others to make all the effort. \n\nIs it reasonable for the host to ask someone to leave if they're not participating? Maybe the guest had social anxiety or was just shy, but the host might be within their rights to manage the party dynamics. However, some might argue that even if the guest wasn't socializing, the host should have been more patient or offered more help. On the other hand, the host is also trying to manage the event and can't be responsible for every guest's social needs. \n\nThe coworker friend (the guest's plus one) was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. If the guest wasn't making an effort and was being passive, the host might not be in the wrong. It's a judgment call. In many cases, people are expected to put in some effort to socialize at a party. If someone is just standing around expecting others to come to them, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The guest might have felt out of place, maybe there was cultural differences or personality issues. The host could have handled it more kindly, but the action of asking to leave might still be justified. The key points are the guest's refusal to engage despite being offered help, and the host's right to manage the party environment. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
