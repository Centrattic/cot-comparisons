I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. I need to figure out if it's A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help him by talking to him, introducing him to someone, and suggesting activities. The guest was left alone again, refused to join the game, and didn't mingle. The host got annoyed and told him to leave if he was just standing around. The guest left, and the coworker (his friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained they couldn't keep dragging him around.\n\nSo, the host made multiple attempts to include the guest. The guest didn't take initiative to socialize beyond the initial interaction. The host felt responsible but set a boundary. The coworker was upset, but the host had a valid reason. \n\nThe key points are: Did the guest have a right to be at the party? Since he was a plus one but came separately, maybe the host didn't have a strict policy. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't make an effort. The host's action was based on the guest not participating and being unresponsive. \n\nPossible angles: The host is not obligated to force social interactions. If the guest was uncomfortable, maybe the host could've handled it more gently, but the guest's own actions (refusing to join, not approaching others) contributed. The host's time and energy are valid considerations. \n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out for not socializing might seem harsh. But the host was proactive in trying to help. The guest's behavior could be passive, expecting others to engage without effort. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong. They tried to include the guest, but when the guest wasn't engaging, they had the right to set a boundary. The coworker's friend might not have been the right fit for the party's social environment. So answer B.\n"
