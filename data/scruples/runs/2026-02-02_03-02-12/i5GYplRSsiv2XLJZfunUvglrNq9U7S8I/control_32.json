I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing. The author invited friends and coworkers, and there was a plus one who came separately. The guest was standing around awkwardly twice, and the author tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but he didn't engage. Then the author told him to leave, and the person left. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the author defended their action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author hosted the party, made an effort to include the guest, but the guest refused to participate. The author's response was to ask him to leave. The main issue here is whether the host's action was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author did try to help the guest feel comfortable by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest's own actions (rejecting the game, not mingling) might indicate they didn't want to participate, even after being given options. The host is responsible for the party's atmosphere and might have felt that the guest was not respecting the event by not engaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's friend might not have been the one to enforce socializing. Maybe the guest felt uncomfortable for a reason, or perhaps the host was too quick to assume the guest was being difficult. Also, telling someone to leave can be seen as abrupt, even if they're not participating. There might be cultural or social norms where expecting guests to always socialize is considered demanding.\n\nBut the author did make an effort to integrate the guest. The guest's repeated refusal to engage, despite help, could justify the author's decision. Hosts have the right to manage their event and may not want to be the constant social organizers for every guest. If the guest was just there to be noticed and not to participate, it might be reasonable to ask them to leave to maintain the party's vibe.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to a guest who wasn't making an effort. Since the author tried to help and the guest didn't reciprocate, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
