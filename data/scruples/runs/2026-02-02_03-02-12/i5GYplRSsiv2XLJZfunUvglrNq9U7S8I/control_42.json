I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but not really. The host tried to help the guest socialize twice but the guest just kept standing around and didn't make an effort. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The host made a genuine effort to include the guest by introducing him to someone and suggesting activities. The guest, however, didn't engage further. The host felt that the guest was being self-pitying and not taking initiative. The host's main argument is that they can't spend all their time facilitating the guest's social interactions. \n\nNow, considering social etiquette and responsibility. As a host, it's reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize, especially if they're at a party. The guest in question didn't reciprocate the host's efforts. While it's true that being the new person can be awkward, the expectation is that guests will try to interact. The host isn't obligated to force social interactions beyond a reasonable effort. \n\nHowever, kicking someone out might be a harsh reaction. But in this case, the host had already tried twice and the guest was uncooperative. The host's responsibility is to their other guests and their own experience. If someone is not engaged and is disruptive (even if not intentionally), removing them isn't unreasonable. The coworker's friend might be upset, but the host's explanation is valid. \n\nSo, the host isn't in the wrong because they made efforts to include the guest, and the guest didn't take initiative. The host has the right to manage their event and set boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
