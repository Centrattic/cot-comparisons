I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The scenario is that the guest, a plus one, was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up being alone again. The host then told the guest to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The host organized the party and was trying to be helpful. The guest might have felt out of place, but the host made attempts to include him. The guest didn't engage when given chances, like joining the Uno game or mingling. The host got annoyed because the guest kept saying no one was talking to him but didn't take initiative. \n\nThe host's actions: after multiple attempts to integrate the guest, the host decided he was just being passive and asked him to leave. The coworker (the guest's companion) felt it was harsh, but the host explained the reasoning. \n\nNow, the question is whether the host was in the wrong. On one hand, the guest might have had social anxiety or was just shy. On the other, the host has their own party and can set boundaries. If the guest isn't participating and is becoming a burden, maybe the host isn't obligated to keep him there. \n\nBut was it fair to kick him out? The host did make efforts to help. The guest didn't reciprocate. The host's main point is that the guest wasn't making an effort, so they had the right to ask him to leave. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like giving more time or understanding. But since the host is the one hosting, they have the authority to manage their guests. \n\nAlso, the coworker's reaction is mentioned, but the host justified their actions. So, in terms of right or wrong, the host might not be in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest wasn't responsive. The host isn't responsible for the guest's social skills. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
