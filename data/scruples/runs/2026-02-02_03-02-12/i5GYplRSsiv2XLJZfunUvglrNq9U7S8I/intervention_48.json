I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. I need to figure out if the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author hosted a party, a guest came as a plus one but not officially. The guest seemed to be standing around alone, even after being introduced and offered activities. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him, but the guest kept saying no one was talking to him and refused to engage further. Then the author told him to leave.\n\nThe key points here are the guest's behavior. The author made efforts to help him integrate, but the guest didn't take the initiative. The author got annoyed because the guest was expecting others to make the effort, not himself. The author then decided to ask him to leave, which the coworker friend found harsh. The author's reasoning is that if the guest isn't making an effort, they shouldn't expect others to accommodate him.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, hosting a party comes with the right to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to force interactions. If someone is being a burden by not contributing to the social environment, the host can reasonably ask them to leave. The guest's refusal to engage and repeated complaints might have crossed a line, making the host feel responsible to maintain the event's atmosphere.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the host could have handled it more gently, maybe by giving more time or another opportunity. But the author had already tried a couple of times. The guest's insistence that no one was talking to him despite being introduced suggests that he wasn't making an effort. So the author's action, while firm, might be justified as protecting the party's environment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who made the effort. The author did try multiple times. The guest's behavior was passive-aggressive, expecting others to fix his discomfort. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary.\n"
