I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a party where the host kicked out a guest for not socializing. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't the plus-one. The host noticed the guest was standing alone. They tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities like a game. But the guest kept being alone again and claimed no one was talking to him. The host got annoyed because the guest was being passive and not making an effort. Eventually, the host told the guest to leave, which led to a conflict with the coworker.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the host was right to kick the guest out. Let's consider the host's perspective. They tried to help the guest integrate, but the guest didn't reciprocate. Maybe the guest was being a bit passive-aggressive, expecting others to approach him instead of making an effort. The host probably felt responsible for the party's atmosphere and didn't want the event to be uncomfortable for others because of one person's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been genuinely shy or anxious. Even if he didn't respond well to the host's attempts, being asked to leave might have felt harsh. Also, the host's coworker thought it was \"shitty\" to tell him to leave, which suggests that maybe the host's reaction was too abrupt.\n\nHowever, the host did make an effort to assist the guest. The guest wasn't just being a troublemaker but might have been struggling socially. The host might have overstepped by not giving the guest more time or alternative options. But considering the context, maybe the host had the right to maintain the party's environment, especially if their time was limited.\n\nAnother angle: the guest was not a direct invitee, so the host might feel less obligated. But that's a bit of a stretch. The key is whether the host acted unreasonably. The guest's refusal to participate in suggested activities could be seen as not making an effort, so the host's decision might be justified as a last resort to prevent the guest from disrupting the party further.\n\nBut was there a better way to handle it? Maybe having a private conversation instead of a public kickout. However, the host did explain their reasoning to the coworker, which shows they had a valid concern about the guest's behavior. So, while the action might be seen as harsh, the host's intent wasn't malicious. Therefore, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
