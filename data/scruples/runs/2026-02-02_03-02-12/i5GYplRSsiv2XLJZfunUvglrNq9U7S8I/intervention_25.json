I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't a plus-one. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting he join a game. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. Then the author told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to include the guest, gave him chances, but he didn't make an effort. Maybe the guest was just not a good socializer. On the other hand, maybe the author was too quick to judge. Could there be other reasons the guest was uncomfortable? Maybe he's shy or had a bad social experience. But the guest did have opportunities to engage and refused. The author's party is their space, so they might feel responsible for the atmosphere.\n\nI think the key points are that the author made multiple attempts to help the guest integrate. When those efforts failed, the author set a boundary. The guest's behavior was passive, not aggressive. The author didn't kick him out violently but gave a choice to leave. The coworker friend who stayed might be biased since it's their friend. The author might have a right to expect guests to participate or at least make an effort. So I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
