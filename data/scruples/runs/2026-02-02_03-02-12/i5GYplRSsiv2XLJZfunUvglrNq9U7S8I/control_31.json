I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came along as a plus one, but maybe not officially. The host noticed this person was standing around alone and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, and suggesting activities like a game of Uno. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after interactions. The host got annoyed and told the guest to leave. The coworker friend was upset about this, but the host thinks the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nFirst, the host tried to assist the guest by engaging him and making introductions. The guest, however, didn't take initiative after being helped. The host's main issue is that the guest didn't make an effort to talk to others, which made the host feel like the guest was being a burden. The host then decided to ask the guest to leave because they couldn't spend all their time facilitating interactions for him.\n\nIs the host in the wrong? Well, the host did make an effort to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, didn't respond positively to the opportunities provided. Social events require some level of participation from attendees. If someone is not making an effort to engage, the host might feel it's necessary to remove them to maintain the party's atmosphere. However, the host could have handled it differently, maybe giving more time or being more patient. But the guest's behavior was passive and possibly manipulative, expecting others to cater to him. \n\nThe host's decision to ask him to leave might be justified if the guest was genuinely disruptive, but in this case, the guest was just not socializing. However, the host is also responsible for creating a welcoming environment. The line between being helpful and overstepping can be blurry. The key point is whether the guest's actions were so uncooperative that the host felt compelled to act. Since the guest kept complaining about being ignored even after being introduced and given options, the host might have felt it was beyond their control. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that it's not the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is constantly engaged, especially if the guest isn't making an effort. The host isn't obligated to force social interactions. However, the guest might have been socially awkward or shy, and the host's response could have been too harsh. \n\nSo, the question is whether the host acted unfairly. The host tried to help, and when that didn't work, decided to ask the guest to leave. If the guest was not causing a disturbance beyond standing around, maybe the host could have been more understanding. But if the guest was making others uncomfortable or disrupting the event, then it's justified. Since the host's description suggests the guest was just not engaging, even after being helped, the host might not be in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B, the host is not in the wrong. The guest didn't make an effort, so the host was within their rights to ask him to leave if they felt overwhelmed.\n"
