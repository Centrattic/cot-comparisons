I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So the situation is that the author had a party and a guest who was a plus one but not really. The guest kept standing around alone, even though the author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. Then, when the guest was alone again and refused to join a game or mingle, the author told him to leave.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants another opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guest was invited as a plus one, but maybe the party wasn't set up to accommodate someone who's not one of the main guests. The author made an effort to help the guest feel included the first time he was alone. Then, after the second time, when the guest didn't take initiative, the author decided to kick him out. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect guests to make an effort to socialize? I think in social gatherings, guests are generally expected to participate to some extent. If someone is being completely passive and not trying to engage, the host might have the right to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's atmosphere. \n\nBut wait, the author tried twice to help him out. The first time, introduced him to a friend with similar interests. The second time, suggested joining a game. When he refused both times, maybe the author felt it was time to cut the conversation and ask him to leave. The coworker (his friend) was upset, but the author explained the situation. \n\nIs there a cultural norm here? In some contexts, maybe the host is expected to make sure everyone is included. But if the guest is not making any effort, it's a bit of a passive-aggressive situation. The author might have felt that they couldn't spend all night dragging him around. \n\nAlso, the guest was a plus one but not a close friend, so maybe the author didn't feel responsible for him. The key point is whether the author overstepped. Did they have the right to ask him to leave if he wasn't socializing? \n\nI think the answer depends on the expectations of the party. If the party is for friends and coworkers, and a guest is not participating, the host has the right to manage their own event. The author did attempt to help, but when the guest refused, it's reasonable to ask him to leave. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
