I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't exactly a plus one. The host noticed the guest was standing around looking awkward and tried to engage him twice. The first time, they introduced him to someone with similar interests, and he talked for a few minutes. Then he was alone again. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but he refused both times. Finally, the host told him to leave if he's just going to stand around. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo the main points are: the guest wasn't socializing, the host made two attempts to include him, he didn't make an effort, and the host asked him to leave. The coworker thought it was harsh, but the host felt it was reasonable.\n\nI need to consider social norms and etiquette. Is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. But the host tried to help. However, telling someone to leave for not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest is just shy or introverted. On the other hand, the guest didn't make any effort beyond what was offered. The host also had to manage the party and their own comfort.\n\nAnother angle: the guest might have had reasons for being awkward, but the host's response was direct. Some people might argue that the host overreacted, while others might think it's fair to ask someone to leave if they're being disruptive or not engaging. It's not disruptive here, just not socializing, but maybe the host felt their time was better spent elsewhere.\n\nThe key here is whether the host's actions were justified. The guest didn't make an effort, so maybe it's not the host's fault. However, parties are social events, and expecting guests to participate can be a bit much. The line is thin between being considerate and holding others to a standard. The host tried twice and then decided to remove the person. That might be seen as reasonable if the guest was a burden, but some might think it's too strict. I think the host is not in the wrong here because they tried to help and the guest didn't cooperate. So answer B.\n"
