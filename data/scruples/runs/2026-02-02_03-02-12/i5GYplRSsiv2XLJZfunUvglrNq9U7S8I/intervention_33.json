I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who hosted the party is in the wrong for kicking out a guest. The situation is that the guest was invited as a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help him socialize by talking to him and introducing him to others, but the guest kept isolating himself and refused to participate. The host then told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. The host is supposed to provide a welcoming environment, but guests also have a responsibility to engage. The guest in question didn't make an effort to socialize despite being offered help twice. The host tried to assist, but after multiple refusals, maybe it's reasonable to set a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out might seem harsh, even if they were acting aloof. The host is in charge of their own party, so they have the authority to manage the atmosphere. The guest's refusal to participate could be affecting the event's vibe for others. \n\nThe coworker who's the plus one might be upset because her friend was asked to leave, but the host had to prioritize the party's flow. The host didn't want to baby-sit the guest. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they made efforts to help and then enforced a boundary. However, maybe there's a middle ground, but the question is about right or wrong. Since the host tried twice and the guest didn't respond, leading to frustration, the host's action could be justified. So the answer is B.\n"
