I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The host had a party. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one. The guest seemed awkward, approached the host twice saying no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests and suggested joining a game. The guest refused both times. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nSo the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. He was given chances but didn't take them. The host felt it was their right to ask him to leave since they couldn't spend all night helping him. The question is whether this is okay.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Parties can be stressful, and some guests might feel shy. But the host has responsibilities too. If someone is making the event uncomfortable or not contributing, maybe they have the right to remove them. However, the guest's friend is upset, which might indicate the host was too harsh. But the guest did refuse multiple opportunities to engage. \n\nOn one hand, the host might have overreacted by asking him to leave. Maybe giving more time or checking in again would be better. On the other hand, the host is also entitled to manage their event. If the guest is just isolating and not trying to interact despite help, the host's decision could be justified.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The host tried to help, and when that failed, they took action. But maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. However, since the guest wasn't engaging and the host felt it was necessary to maintain the party's environment, the answer might lean towards the host not being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
