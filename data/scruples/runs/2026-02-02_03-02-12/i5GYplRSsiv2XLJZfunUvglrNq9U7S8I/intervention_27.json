I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did the right thing by kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The guest was a plus one but didn't actually interact with others. He kept saying no one was talking to him, but even after the host tried to help by introducing him to someone, he ended up alone again. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibilities. When you host a party, you're responsible for the environment, but you can't force people to socialize. However, everyone has a right to enjoy the event without being disruptive. The guest in question wasn't engaging, which might be impacting the host's experience. But was it the host's responsibility to fix the guest's social issues?\n\nThe guest claimed he was being ignored, but when given a chance to interact (introduced to a friend, suggested to join a game), he didn't take it. That suggests he might have been choosing to isolate himself rather than being excluded. If that's the case, the host isn't obligated to keep him there if he's not making an effort. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. Telling someone to leave can be harsh, but if the guest is making the host uncomfortable with their behavior, it might be necessary. The host also considered the coworker friend's reaction, showing they thought about the situation before acting. \n\nSo, the host tried to help the guest, but when the guest didn't reciprocate, the host decided to end the situation. I think that's reasonable. The host isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since the guest wasn't following social cues to engage. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
