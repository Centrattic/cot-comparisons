I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author had a party and invited friends and coworkers. One guest came as a plus one but maybe wasn't explicitly invited. The guest was standing around alone, and the author tried twice to help him socialize\u2014first by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests, then suggesting he join a game. The guest refused both times. The author then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the actions taken by the author. The guest was given two chances to engage, but he didn't take them. The author did attempt to help, so maybe they weren't being overly harsh. But kicking someone out because they're not socializing might be seen as rude. However, the author is also hosting the event, so they might have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the party's atmosphere.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and gave the guest opportunities to socialize. The guest's refusal could mean he wasn't interested in participating, and the author has the responsibility to manage their own party. The coworker's reaction was negative, but the author explained their reasoning. So, the answer is B.\n"
