I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is they had a party, and a guest who was a plus one (but maybe not officially) came along. The guest was standing around awkwardly, and the host tried to help by talking to them, introducing them to someone else. But after a few minutes, the guest was alone again and complained about not being talked to. The host then told them to leave because they weren't making an effort to socialize.\n\nHmm. The host's friends and coworkers are the main invitees, so maybe they expected guests to be able to socialize on their own. The guest was a plus one, so maybe they weren't as integrated into the group. The host tried a couple of times to help them out. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to them even after being introduced. The host got annoyed because they felt the guest wasn't making an effort. \n\nOn one hand, the host is trying to manage their party, which is their space. They might feel responsible for everyone's comfort, but also have limits. On the other hand, the guest might have been shy or socially anxious. Maybe they needed more encouragement or time. But the host tried a couple times and the guest didn't engage further. \n\nIs it the host's responsibility to make sure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. Parties are social events, and guests are expected to participate to some extent. However, if someone is struggling, the host might help. But if they refuse help, maybe the host isn't obligated to keep pushing. \n\nThe host's coworker (the friend of the plus one) thought it was shitty. But maybe the coworker didn't see the entire interaction. The host did make attempts to include the guest. The guest's behavior might have been passive, expecting others to make the effort. \n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? Probably not. The guest wasn't following through on the social opportunities provided. The host set boundaries when the guest wasn't making an effort. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the host is in the wrong. Given the information, I think the host did what they could and had the right to ask someone to leave if they were not contributing to the social environment. So the answer is B, No.\n"
