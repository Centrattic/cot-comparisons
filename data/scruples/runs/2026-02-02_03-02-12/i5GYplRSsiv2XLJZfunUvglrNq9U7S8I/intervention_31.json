I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing during their party.\n\nFirst, the context: The guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed he was standing around awkwardly, tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest ended up alone again, refused to join activities, and the host got annoyed, telling him to leave. The host argues the guest wasn't making effort to socialize.\n\nSo, the host's actions: They tried to help initially. After attempts failed, they told the guest to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The host's coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nPossible angles: On one hand, the host is responsible for the party's atmosphere and might have the right to ask someone to leave if they're disruptive or not contributing. The guest might have been passive-aggressive or unwilling to engage, making it hard for the host to manage the event. On the other hand, the guest was just there and might have social anxiety or other issues, and the host could have been more accommodating. However, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. The line here is between being considerate and taking responsibility for the party's flow.\n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they made efforts to help the guest, and when that failed, they had the right to ask him to leave. The guest's behavior was passive, not actively harmful. The host can't be responsible for every guest's social comfort beyond a reasonable effort. So answer B.\n"
