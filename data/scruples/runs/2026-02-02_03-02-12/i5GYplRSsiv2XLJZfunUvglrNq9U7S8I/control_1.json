I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had a party and a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced to someone and being suggested to join a game. The author then kicked him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they hosted the party, tried to help the guest by introducing him and suggesting activities, but when he refused to engage further, they felt it was necessary to ask him to leave. They might be frustrated because the guest wasn't making an effort and was being passive. The author might feel they're within their rights to manage their party and not have someone just standing around.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been feeling anxious or uncomfortable. Even if he wasn't making the effort, maybe he was genuinely struggling to connect. The author's response was to kick him out, which could be seen as harsh. The coworker (his friend) thought it was \"shitty\" to tell him to leave, implying that maybe the author was too quick to judge or didn't give enough leeway. Also, the guest was a plus one, so maybe he wasn't expecting to know everyone, and the author's party might have been a new environment for him.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author gave the guest enough opportunities to socialize. The author did talk to him twice, introduced him to someone, suggested the game. The guest refused to engage. The author might have a right to enforce some level of social behavior at their own party, especially if it's affecting the overall atmosphere. However, asking someone to leave might be an overreaction if it's the first time the guest is attending such an event and he's just shy. The author could have given more time or tried different approaches instead of immediately kicking him out. Also, considering the guest was a plus one, maybe the author should be more understanding.\n\nAnother angle: hosting a party is the author's space, so they have some control over the environment. But is it fair to expect everyone to socialize? Some people are introverted and might prefer to observe or talk to a few people. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have been more patient. The coworker's disapproval suggests that maybe the author's reaction was too harsh. However, the guest was not making any effort to integrate, which could be seen as rude.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The author's decision could be seen as reasonable to maintain the party's atmosphere. However, others might argue that it's not the author's responsibility to force someone to socialize. The line between being a good host and being overbearing is thin here. Since the guest was a plus one, maybe the author should have anticipated that he might be more reserved. But the guest's refusal to engage after multiple attempts might justify the author's actions.\n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a judgment call. The author's actions might be seen as justified if they felt the guest wasn't making an effort, but others might think it was too harsh. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author made attempts to help and then asked the guest to leave when he wasn't contributing to the party. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the author should have been more tolerant. Considering the context given, I think B is more likely the answer here.\n"
