I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the context: The host had a party where a guest (a plus one of a coworker) was standing around alone. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, and suggesting activities, but the guest kept claiming no one was talking to him. Eventually, the host told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, the main points to consider. The host made several attempts to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, refused to participate in the games or mingle, even after being introduced and given suggestions. The host's party is their space, and they have the right to ask someone to leave if that person isn't respecting the environment or making an effort to engage. \n\nBut wait, maybe the guest had social anxiety or shyness. The host tried to help, but maybe they could have been more patient. However, the guest's behavior was passive-aggressive\u2014saying no one is talking to him when he was already introduced and given chances. The host's responsibility isn't to force social interactions; they can only encourage. If someone refuses to engage beyond a reasonable effort, the host isn't obligated to keep them there. \n\nAlso, the coworker (his friend) was informed, so there's accountability. The host isn't being mean without cause. They addressed the issue after multiple attempts. It seems like the guest wasn't taking responsibility for his own social interaction, and the host set a boundary. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people usually side with the host if they've made reasonable efforts. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
