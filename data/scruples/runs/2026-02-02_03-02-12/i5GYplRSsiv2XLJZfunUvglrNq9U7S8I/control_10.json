I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user wants a quick answer but I need to think it through properly.\n\nSo the situation is that the host had a party and a guest (a plus one, but not really) was standing around looking awkward. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him and refused to engage. Then the host asked him to leave, and the question is whether the host was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the host did make an effort to include the guest: asked if he was okay, talked to him, introduced him, suggested joining a game. The guest didn't try to interact further. The host's main point is that if the guest wasn't making an effort, he shouldn't take up the host's time. The coworker friend thought it was shitty to kick him out, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, is the host wrong? Well, hosting a party is about creating a good environment for guests. If someone isn't engaging, maybe it's on them. But the host also has a right to manage their own event. The guest might have been socially awkward or shy, but the host wasn't ignoring him\u2014they tried. The guest kept relying on the host to fix the situation instead of trying himself. The host's action was firm but maybe justified. They didn't force the guest to leave but asked him to leave after attempts to help. So probably the host is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
