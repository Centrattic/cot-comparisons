I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party, and one guest was brought by a coworker but wasn't a plus one. The guest was standing around alone, got help from the host to talk to someone, but then went back to being alone. The host tried to get him to participate in games or mingle, but the guest refused. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the host was right to ask the guest to leave. Let's break it down.\n\nThe host's perspective: They were hosting the party, wanted everyone to enjoy, noticed the guest wasn't engaging despite efforts, felt the guest was being passive, and decided to remove him to maintain the party's atmosphere. The host might argue that they had the right to set boundaries, especially if the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment and was maybe making others uncomfortable.\n\nThe guest's perspective: He felt awkward, tried to reach out, and couldn't connect. The host's response was to kick him out instead of helping him more. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh. He might feel it was unfair to be asked to leave when he was just struggling socially.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, parties require some level of self-initiated interaction. If someone refuses to make an effort despite being helped, the host might feel justified in removing them if they're disrupting the event. However, the host could also be seen as not being empathetic enough, as social anxiety exists and not everyone can just \"mingle.\"\n\nBut the host did try to help twice. The guest refused both times, which the host might see as not making an effort. The host is also responsible for the atmosphere, and if someone is just standing around not engaging, others might find that awkward. The coworker, however, defended the guest, implying maybe the host was too strict.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it often depends on context. The host had a right to ask someone to leave if they weren't respecting the social norms of the party. But the guest might have had valid social anxiety. However, the host did make an effort to help, and the guest refused. The line is whether the guest's lack of socializing was a legitimate social issue or a passive-aggressive refusal to participate.\n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong here. They tried to help, and when it didn't work, they made a decision to remove someone who wasn't engaging. It's not uncommon for hosts to expect guests to participate to some extent. So the answer is B.\n"
