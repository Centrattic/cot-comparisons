I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author hosted a party and ended up kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one of a coworker but arrived separately. The author tried to help him by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting he join a game. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him and refused to engage. Then the author told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's responsibility as a host. Hosts usually try to make guests feel welcome, but they also have the right to manage their event. The guest wasn't being disruptive or causing any trouble; he was just not socializing. The author made multiple attempts to help him integrate, like introducing him and suggesting activities. But the guest didn't take initiative. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to ask someone to leave if they're not participating? The guest was making the author uncomfortable by repeatedly saying no one was talking to him when he had been engaged before. The author felt the guest was expecting others to make an effort for him, which might not be fair. Hosts can set boundaries, and if a guest is not making an effort to socialize, it's understandable to ask them to leave if it's affecting the event's atmosphere. \n\nBut on the other hand, some might argue that the author should have been more patient or found another way to help the guest feel included, like pairing him with different people. However, the author did take steps to assist, and the coworker (the guest's plus one) supported the decision, even if they found it harsh. The key point is whether the author overstepped by not giving more opportunities. But given that the guest refused multiple suggestions, it's reasonable to conclude the author wasn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
