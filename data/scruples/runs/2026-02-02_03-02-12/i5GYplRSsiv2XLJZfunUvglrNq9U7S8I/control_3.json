I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but didn't know many people. The guest kept standing around and claimed no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests and suggested joining a game. The guest refused both times, and the host told him to leave if he wasn't socializing. The coworker later criticized the host.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The host made an effort to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest didn't take the initiative to engage further. The host's actions were to address the guest's lack of effort to socialize. \n\nCommon social norms suggest that guests are expected to make some effort to mingle. If someone is being difficult or uncooperative, the host may have the right to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's atmosphere. However, the line is blurry here. The guest was clearly uncomfortable, but was the host's response appropriate?\n\nThe host's annoyance might be a red flag. Instead of escalating to asking the guest to leave, maybe offering more support or understanding could have been better. But the guest's refusal to engage in any suggested activities (like joining the game or mingling) could justify the host's decision. The coworker's reaction is also a point to consider\u2014maybe the host was too harsh, but the guest wasn't entirely blameless either.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host often isn't considered in the wrong if they have a good reason. Since the guest wasn't making an effort, and the host tried to help, the answer might lean towards the host not being in the wrong. However, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or offered more assistance. But given the context, the host's actions seem reasonable. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
