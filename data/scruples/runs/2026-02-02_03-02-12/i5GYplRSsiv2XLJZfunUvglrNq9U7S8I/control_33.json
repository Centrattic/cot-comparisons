I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation is that the guest was invited as a plus one but didn't really socialize, kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The host tried to help but eventually told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one for a coworker but came separately. The host noticed he was awkward, tried to help by talking to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests. But then the guest went back to being alone, refused to join activities, and the host got annoyed. The host concluded the guest wanted to be pitied and told him to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained they couldn't spend all their time dragging him around.\n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? Let's think about the key points. The host made efforts to include the guest. The guest didn't reciprocate, kept complaining without making an effort. The host's actions were to maintain the party and not let it be a burden. But was it right to kick someone out for not socializing? Maybe the guest was just shy or had social anxiety. The host might have assumed the worst without considering other possibilities. On the other hand, the host has the right to manage their own party. It's a balance between being considerate and not enabling someone who isn't contributing.\n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. Some might say the host is not in the wrong because they tried to help and couldn't be responsible for the guest's discomfort. Others might say that telling someone to leave for not socializing is harsh, even if the guest was being passive. The line between helping and being overbearing is thin. The host's frustration is understandable, but the solution might have been abrupt. However, the host did attempt to assist, so maybe it's justifiable. The coworker's reaction is a point against the host, but maybe that's because the coworker is defensive of their friend.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the host has some responsibility to ensure guests feel comfortable. However, the guest also has a responsibility to make an effort. If the guest is unwilling to do anything, the host isn't obligated to keep them around. So the answer could be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But maybe the host could have handled it more gently. However, the key is whether they were in the wrong. Since the host tried to include and then set a boundary when the guest didn't reciprocate, it's a judgment call. I think leaning towards B because the host isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe A if the host was too quick to judge. But considering the steps the host took, probably B.\n"
