I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the context: The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host noticed the guest was standing around, asked if they were okay, tried introducing them to others, but the guest kept being alone. The host got annoyed and told them to leave if they weren't going to socialize. The coworker (the guest's plus one) thought it was harsh.\n\nSo, the host is defending their action by saying the guest wasn't making an effort. The question is whether the host is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider a few points. First, the host's responsibility. Hosts often want everyone to enjoy the party, but they also have the right to manage their event. If the guest was being disruptive or creating a negative atmosphere, kicking them out makes sense. However, in this case, the guest wasn't disruptive, just not socializing. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't engage. \n\nThe host's actions: They asked if the guest was okay, introduced them, suggested activities, but the guest refused. Then the host told them to leave if they weren't going to participate. Was this a reasonable response? \n\nFrom one angle, the host is responsible for their own party and can set boundaries. If someone is not contributing to the social environment and is being a burden, it might be acceptable to ask them to leave. On the other hand, maybe the guest had valid reasons for being awkward, like shyness or social anxiety. The host's approach could come off as dismissive. \n\nBut the guest had opportunities to engage and refused. The host tried to help, and after multiple attempts, the guest still wasn't participating. The host might feel they can't spend all their time accommodating one person. \n\nHowever, the host could have handled it more gracefully, maybe by offering to help find someone else or giving them space. But the act of asking to leave isn't necessarily wrong. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the focus is on whether the person acted unkindly or inconsiderately. Here, the host tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's frustration is understandable. The coworker's reaction might be more about defending their friend than the host's actions being objectively wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the host isn't in the wrong. They made reasonable attempts to include the guest and then made a judgment call that the guest wasn't putting in effort. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
