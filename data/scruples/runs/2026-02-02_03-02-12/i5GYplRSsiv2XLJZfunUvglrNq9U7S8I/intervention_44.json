I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The scenario involves a guest who was invited as a plus one but kept standing around and complained about not being talked to, even after being introduced and given opportunities to engage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social expectations here. Hosting a party usually involves creating a welcoming environment for guests. The author tried to help the guest by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, and suggesting activities like joining a game. But the guest didn't take initiative after being given those chances. \n\nThe author's main point is that the guest wasn't making an effort beyond just standing around and complaining. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was bad to kick him out. The question is whether the author overstepped by asking the guest to leave.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the author have the right to remove someone who wasn't participating? Is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is engaged? Or is it the guest's responsibility to make their own connections? Also, the guest was a plus one, which might imply they weren't the main invitee, so maybe the host felt less obligation.\n\nAnother point is that the author tried multiple times to help the guest integrate but eventually got frustrated. The line between being a helpful host and being responsible for the guest's social experience is blurry. If the guest was being disruptive or causing problems, it's easier to justify removal, but in this case, the guest was just awkward and not engaging.\n\nI think the key here is that the author gave the guest multiple chances. Once it's clear the guest isn't making an effort, the host isn't obligated to keep them around, especially if it's affecting the host's ability to enjoy their own party. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But maybe some might argue that the host should have handled it more gently, like asking the guest to leave instead of directly kicking them out. However, since the author explained their reasoning to the coworker, maybe that's sufficient.\n"
