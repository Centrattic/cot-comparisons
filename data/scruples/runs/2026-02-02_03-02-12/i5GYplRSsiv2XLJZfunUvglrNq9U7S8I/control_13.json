I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus-one. The host noticed the guest was awkward, approached him, introduced him to someone with similar interests, and even suggested joining a game. The guest kept being left alone again, refused to mingle, and the host got annoyed, leading to telling him to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) was upset about it.\n\nSo, the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort, just wanted attention, and the host couldn't spend all their time on it. The question is whether the host is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the host tried to help the guest by introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest, however, didn't engage and kept isolating himself. The host might feel responsible for the guest's comfort, but maybe they set boundaries correctly. On the other hand, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh. People have different social needs; some might be introverted or just not in the mood. The host might have overreacted, especially since the guest was a friend of a coworker, so the coworker felt it was \"shitty\" the guest was told to leave.\n\nBut the host also has the right to manage their own party. If someone isn't contributing to the social environment and is being a drain on the host's time, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave. The key point is whether the host gave enough opportunities for the guest to integrate. They did: talked to him, introduced him, suggested activities. The guest refused each time. So the host's action might be justified because they tried to help and the guest wasn't reciprocating.\n\nBut maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The guest's friend was upset, but that's a factor. Still, the host isn't obligated to force someone to stay if they're not making an effort. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, some might argue it's unkind. But given the context, the host tried multiple times, so B is more likely.\n"
