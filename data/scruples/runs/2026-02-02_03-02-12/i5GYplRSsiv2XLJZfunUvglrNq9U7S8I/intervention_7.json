I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the context: the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But the guest kept standing alone, refused to join activities, and the host felt he wasn't making an effort. The host told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective. They had a party, invited people for a social event. It's reasonable to expect guests to participate to some extent. The host made efforts to help the guest integrate. When the guest didn't reciprocate and just stood around, the host might feel justified in asking him to leave, especially if the guest's presence was affecting the atmosphere.\n\nBut on the other hand, the guest might have had social anxiety or other reasons for not engaging. The host's right to manage their own party could be seen as valid, but was it fair to kick someone out for not socializing? Maybe the host could have handled it differently, like giving more time or a gentle reminder. However, the guest's lack of effort is a factor here. If the host is responsible for the environment, they might have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the social aspect they were invited for.\n\nAlso, the coworker's disapproval is mentioned, but the host isn't obligated to make everyone happy. The key is whether the host overstepped. Since the guest wasn't causing harm beyond not interacting, some might argue it's a bit harsh. But others might say the host has the authority. It's a bit of a grey area. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't take initiative. So the answer might lean towards B, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
