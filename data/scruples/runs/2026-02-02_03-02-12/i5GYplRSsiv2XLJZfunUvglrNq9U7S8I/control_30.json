I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a host kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. One guest was a plus-one but not officially. He came separately with a coworker. The host noticed he was awkward, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. Then he ended up alone again. The host suggested joining a game and mingling, but he refused. The host then asked him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend was upset about the ejection.\n\nSo the question is whether the host was wrong to kick out the guest for not socializing. Let's think about possible angles. On one hand, hosting a party is about creating a social environment, and guests are expected to participate to some extent. If someone is disruptive or not making an effort, the host might have the right to remove them. On the other hand, the guest might have been shy or introverted, and the host's approach could be seen as harsh. The host did make efforts to include the guest, but after multiple attempts failed, the host decided to remove him.\n\nAnother point: the guest was a plus-one, so maybe the host didn't expect to have to take responsibility for him. But in a social setting, even if someone is a plus-one, they're still a guest. The host tried to help, but the guest wasn't engaging. The host's frustration is understandable if they felt responsible for the party's dynamics. However, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing might be seen as rude, especially if the person isn't causing disruption beyond being quiet.\n\nBut the guest was asking for attention and then refusing to take the host's suggestions. The host might have felt that the guest was being passive-aggressive or expecting others to cater to him. In that case, the host's action to set a boundary is defensible. The key here is whether socializing is a requirement for attending a party. If the party is a casual event, maybe the host isn't obligated to force interaction. But the host might also have the right to maintain the party's atmosphere.\n\nConsidering all this, the host's actions might be justified if the guest was uncooperative and the host felt their own time and energy were being consumed. However, there's a balance between being a good host and being overly strict. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal expectations. In many cases, hosts do expect guests to make some effort to socialize, especially in a party setting. Therefore, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
