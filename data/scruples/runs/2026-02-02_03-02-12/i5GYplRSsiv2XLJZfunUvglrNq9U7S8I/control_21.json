I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they kicked a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was sort of a plus one but not officially. He came with a coworker's friend. The host noticed him standing alone, tried talking to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up alone again. When the host suggested joining a game or mingling, he refused. The host then told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend was upset about it, but the host stood by their decision.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The host made an effort to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him. The guest, however, didn't take initiative beyond the initial introductions. The host's party is their own space, so they have the right to set boundaries. If someone is not engaging and is creating an awkward situation, the host might feel it's necessary to ask them to leave. However, some might argue that it's harsh to kick someone out for being shy or not socializing enough. \n\nBut the host did try multiple times to include the guest. The guest's refusal to engage in activities and the fact that he kept saying he wasn't being talked to despite previous interactions might have given the host reason to believe there was an issue with the guest's attitude. The host also considered the time and energy they had, which is a valid point because hosting parties can be tiring. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was just introverted or anxious, and the host could have handled it differently, like offering more support or understanding. But the host's main responsibility isn't to force socialization. If the guest was disruptive or refusing to participate, then it's reasonable to ask them to leave. The key here is that the host provided opportunities, but the guest didn't take them. So, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary. The coworker's reaction might be expected, but the host's decision was based on the guest's lack of effort. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The host tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host has the right to manage their party as they see fit.\n"
