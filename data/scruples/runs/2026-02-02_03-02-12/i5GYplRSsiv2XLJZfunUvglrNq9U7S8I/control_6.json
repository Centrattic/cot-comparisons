I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party and a guest came as a plus one, but maybe wasn't really a plus one. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, even after being offered to join a game. The host got annoyed and told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend was upset about this.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the host overstep by telling the guest to leave? The host tried to help, but the guest didn't make an effort. The host's responsibility is to manage their party, but is it okay to kick someone out for being shy or not socializing?\n\nOn one hand, the host made an effort to include the guest. The guest, however, might have been too shy or uncomfortable. The host might have felt that the guest wasn't making an effort, leading to frustration. But on the other hand, even if someone is awkward, it's not the host's job to force socialization. The guest could have just had a bad time, and kicking them out might be harsh. \n\nThe line between helping and being overbearing is thin. The host might have thought they were doing what's best, but making someone leave for not engaging could be seen as rude. However, if the guest was being a burden and the host felt it was necessary to maintain the party atmosphere, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe coworker's reaction that it was \"shitty\" to tell him to leave suggests others might see it as the host's fault. But the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer might lean towards the host not being in the wrong (B), because they tried to help and set boundaries. But some might argue that the host should have been more patient. However, the guest was given multiple chances. The host's decision to ask him to leave if he's just standing there could be seen as reasonable, especially if it's affecting the party's vibe.\n"
