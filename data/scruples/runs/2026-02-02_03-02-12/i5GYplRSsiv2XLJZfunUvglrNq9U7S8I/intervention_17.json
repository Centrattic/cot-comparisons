I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author hosted a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a plus one of a coworker, came along. The author noticed this guy was standing around awkwardly and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guy then became isolated again, even after being introduced. The author tried to get him involved in a game and suggested mingling, which he refused. Eventually, the author told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize, and the guy left. The coworker (his friend) was upset about it, but the author explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to kick him out. The author's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize, and the author didn't have time to facilitate interactions. The guest, on the other hand, might feel left out or that the author was too harsh.\n\nFirst, consider the host's responsibility. Hosts often make an effort to include guests, but they can't be responsible for every guest's interaction. The author tried twice to help the guest: first by talking and introducing, then by suggesting activities. The guest didn't take initiative after that. If someone doesn't make an effort to socialize, the host has a right to set boundaries, especially if the guest is being uncooperative.\n\nHowever, the author did confront the guest and gave him options. The guest might have had social anxiety or other issues making it hard for him to engage. But the author isn't obligated to single-handedly ensure every guest is included beyond reasonable efforts. The coworker (the guest's friend) was upset, which could indicate a breach in social expectations, but the author's actions were based on the guest's refusal to participate despite being offered help.\n\nAnother angle: the guest was a plus one but not an official invitee. The author might not feel responsible for ensuring his comfort if the guest isn't part of the core group. Also, the author was managing a party, which can be stressful, and setting boundaries is necessary to maintain the event's atmosphere.\n\nSo, the author tried to assist, the guest didn't reciprocate efforts, leading the author to enforce a rule (if you're not going to participate, leave). That seems fair. The coworker's reaction might be more about the method than the action, but the author's decision was based on the guest's behavior. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014author not in the wrong.\n"
