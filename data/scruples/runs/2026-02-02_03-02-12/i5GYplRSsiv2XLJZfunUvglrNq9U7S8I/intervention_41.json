I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, was invited along. The host noticed this person was standing around awkwardly. They tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but after a short chat, he was alone again. The host made more suggestions, but the guest refused. The host got annoyed and told him to leave if he was just going to stand around. The coworker friend was upset about it, but the host explained they couldn't spend time dragging him to socialize.\n\nSo, the host's perspective is that the guest wasn't making an effort to join in, kept being passive, and the host had to manage the event. The host felt it was necessary to remove someone who wasn't contributing and was making things awkward. The coworker friend thought it was harsh, but the host stood by their decision.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. Hosting a party involves managing the environment so everyone can enjoy. If a guest is uncooperative and not engaging despite attempts to help, it can be disruptive. The host tried multiple times to assist the guest\u2014talking to him, introducing him, suggesting activities. The guest's refusal to engage might be due to shyness, discomfort, or maybe just not wanting to be there. However, the host's responsibility isn't to force interactions but to maintain a positive atmosphere for others.\n\nThe key factors are: Did the host give enough opportunities for the guest to integrate? Yes, they made several attempts. Was the guest's behavior affecting the party? The host felt it was, and if someone is causing discomfort or not respecting the event's purpose, removal might be justified. The host also considered it their right to set boundaries for their own event.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that telling someone to leave is harsh, especially if they're struggling socially. But the host had made efforts to include the guest, and the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's actions could be seen as managing the situation after exhausting options.\n\nSo, in this case, the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help, the guest didn't make an effort, and the host had the right to ask someone to leave if they weren't contributing to the event's enjoyment. The answer should be B (No).\n"
