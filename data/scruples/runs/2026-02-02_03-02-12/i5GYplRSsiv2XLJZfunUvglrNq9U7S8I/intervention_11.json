I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who kicked a guest out of their party is in the wrong. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but not really, came separately, and kept standing around saying no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone else and suggesting he join a game or mingle. When the guest still refused, the host told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest was a friend of a coworker, so maybe the host felt some obligation to include him but wasn't entirely responsible. The guest was given multiple chances to engage\u2014talking, being introduced, suggestions to join games. However, he didn't make an effort beyond the initial interactions. \n\nThe key points here are whether the host's actions were reasonable. The host tried to help, but when the guest was resistant and not taking initiative, the host decided to remove him. The host's coworker friend disagreed, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nSocial dynamics can be tricky. The host is responsible for the environment they created. If the guest didn't engage after attempts to integrate him, maybe it's a matter of the host's limits. People can't be forced to socialize, but if someone is being a burden by not trying, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave.\n\nAnother angle: parties require social effort from attendees. If someone is there but not participating despite opportunities, they might be seen as a disruption. The host isn't obligated to cater to every individual's discomfort. However, some might argue that the host should have handled it more gently, maybe by giving more time or finding another way to help the guest integrate.\n\nLegally, the host can ask someone to leave their property if they're not following the rules or causing issues. Emotionally, it's a bit more subjective. The host's frustration is understandable if they felt the guest was expecting others to make the effort. The coworker friend's reaction suggests it's a common point of contention, but the host's reasoning is valid in terms of personal boundaries.\n\nIn similar discussions, people often split on this. Some say the host is within their rights, others say it's harsh. But in this case, since the host made multiple attempts and the guest refused to engage, the answer might lean towards the host not being in the wrong. The guest's behavior could be seen as expecting others to make the effort, which isn't fair. So the answer would be B.\n"
