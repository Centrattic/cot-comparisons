I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't a plus-one. The guest stood alone, got help from the host to talk to someone, but after a while, was alone again. The host tried to suggest activities, but the guest refused. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about that.\n\nSo, the host's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort. But is it fair? Well, maybe the guest is introverted or just not comfortable in big groups. The host did try to help by introducing him, but when that didn't work, maybe they were too quick to judge. Also, the guest might feel anxious or have social issues, so the host's response of kicking him out could be harsh. On the other hand, the host is responsible for the event and can set boundaries. If the guest was disruptive or uninvited, maybe it's justified. But here, the guest was invited via a coworker, so maybe not. The key points are whether the host gave enough support and if the guest's actions were reasonable. The host might have overreacted, expecting the guest to socialize when maybe he wasn't in the mood. So, maybe the host is not in the wrong because they tried to help, but some might argue they should have been more patient. But the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) since the host did make efforts and has the right to manage their party. However, others might say A because pushing the guest to socialize is too much. Hmm.\n"
