I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. So, the main points here are that the guest was a plus one, came separately, and kept standing around alone even after being introduced and given suggestions. The host tried to help by talking to him twice and making introductions, but the guest didn't take initiative again. The host then asked him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained they couldn't spend all their time dragging him around.\n\nHmm. The key factors are the host's actions. They made an effort to include the guest initially. The guest's response was to say he's not being talked to, but after being introduced and offered to join a game, he refused. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making any effort. Now, is the host in the wrong?\n\nWell, hosting a party is a social event, and guests are expected to participate to some degree. If someone is clearly not contributing and keeping to themselves despite attempts to include them, the host might feel it's affecting the party's atmosphere. But is it fair to kick someone out for not socializing? On one hand, the host is responsible for the event and their own comfort. If the guest is causing discomfort or not engaging, maybe it's reasonable. But on the other hand, maybe the guest was just shy or had a bad day. The host did try to help, but two attempts and then giving the guest an ultimatum might be a bit abrupt. \n\nThe guest was a plus one, which sometimes means they might not be as familiar with the group. The host's responsibility is to the overall party, but it's also possible the guest felt out of place and couldn't connect. However, the host did offer multiple opportunities to socialize and the guest didn't take them. The host's time is limited, and they can't be expected to constantly be the one facilitating interaction. \n\nThe coworker's reaction is that it was \"shitty,\" which suggests some people might think the host overstepped. But the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort. So, the host might not be in the wrong here. They tried to help and set boundaries when the guest didn't reciprocate the effort. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and how others perceive the host's role. If the host is expected to make sure every guest is comfortable, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if the guest is also expected to participate and not just rely on others to do all the work, then the host is justified. Since the host did make a couple of attempts and the guest didn't engage, it's more about the guest's responsibility. So, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. Maybe answer B.\n"
