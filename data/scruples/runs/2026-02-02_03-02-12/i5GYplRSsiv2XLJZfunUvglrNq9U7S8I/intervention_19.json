I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about hosting a party and kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one. The host noticed the guest was standing around alone, tried talking to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join games or mingle. The host got annoyed, told him to leave, and later the coworker thought it was harsh, but the host didn't have time to force interactions.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So the question is, is the host justified in asking the guest to leave?\n\nI should consider social norms and expectations. When hosting an event, it's reasonable to expect guests to engage to some extent. However, forcing someone to socialize isn't appropriate. The guest might be shy or uncomfortable, which is different from refusing to make an effort. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. If the guest was unwilling to reciprocate, maybe the host is within their rights to ask him to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. For example, giving the guest a chance to settle in longer or offering to help him meet people. But the guest's behavior of repeatedly standing alone and refusing opportunities to engage could be seen as not respecting the host's effort. The host isn't obligated to force socialization, so if the guest isn't contributing to the event's enjoyment, asking them to leave isn't unreasonable.\n\nI think the key points are: the host made efforts to include the guest, the guest didn't make reciprocal efforts, leading to the host feeling it's necessary to maintain the party's environment. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
