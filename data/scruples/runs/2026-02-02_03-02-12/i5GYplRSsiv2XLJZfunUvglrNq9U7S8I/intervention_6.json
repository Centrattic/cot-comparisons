I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where the host kicks out a guest who wasn't socializing. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone, and suggesting activities, but the guest kept being alone. The host got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They hosted the party, which requires effort and time. If a guest is not engaging, the host might feel that the guest is not respecting their time or the social environment. The host made multiple attempts to help the guest integrate, but the guest didn't reciprocate. That could be frustrating.\n\nThen, the guest's side. Maybe he felt awkward and was shy, or perhaps he had a different social style. Not everyone is comfortable immediately mingling in a group. He might have needed more encouragement or time. But the host did try to help, so maybe the guest is responsible for not making an effort after being introduced.\n\nThe coworker (the guest's friend) is upset because the host told the guest to leave. The host explained they couldn't keep facilitating interactions. But is it reasonable for a host to expect guests to make their own social connections? Parties are social events, so guests are expected to participate to some extent. If someone is just standing around and not engaging, the host isn't obligated to constantly check on them.\n\nAlso, the guest was a \"plus one\" but came separately. Maybe the host didn't have space for extra people, but they said there was plenty of food and drinks. So it's not about resources. The host's main issue was the guest's lack of socialization and the desire to maintain the party's atmosphere.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to set boundaries. If a guest is being a burden or not contributing to the social aspect, the host can ask them to leave, especially if other guests are affected. But was the host's approach too harsh? They did try to help, and the guest kept not engaging. The host might have felt they couldn't spend all their time managing that one person.\n\nAnother angle: loneliness is a common issue. Maybe the guest was genuinely struggling. But the host is also entitled to their time and not feeling responsible for everyone's social interactions. The key is whether the host's actions were justified given the attempts made. \n\nSo, the host made efforts. The guest didn't reciprocate. The host decided to remove someone who wasn't participating. It's a tough call, but the host isn't necessarily in the wrong if they communicated clearly and the guest was aware of the expectations. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
