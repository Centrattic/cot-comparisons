I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from the author's perspective. They hosted a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not formally invited, came separately with the coworker. The author tried to help him by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. However, the guest kept standing alone, said no one was talking to him even after an introduction, refused to join activities, and the author eventually told him to leave. The coworker felt it was shitty, but the author explained they couldn't make others talk to him.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nKey points to consider: \n- The author tried twice to help the guest integrate (talking to him, introducing him, suggesting activities).\n- The guest didn't make an effort to socialize beyond what was offered. \n- The author's hosting experience and comfort are important. Parties can be stressful, and the host has the right to manage the event as they see fit.\n- The guest might have had valid social anxiety, but the author's actions were based on the guest not reciprocating efforts.\n- The plus one status adds a layer where the guest might not be expected to socialize as much, but the author might not feel responsible for that.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. On one hand, the host tried to help, and if the guest still didn't engage, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave to avoid burdening the host. On the other hand, some might argue that the host should have been more accommodating or that the guest didn't get a fair chance. \n\nBut the author made genuine efforts. The guest's lack of initiative could be a factor. Also, the coworker's reaction might be influenced by their personal relationship with the guest. The author's right to set boundaries at their own party is significant. So, the answer is likely B. However, I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. For example, was the guest's behavior beyond their control (like severe anxiety)? The post doesn't mention that, so the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
