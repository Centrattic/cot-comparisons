I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not formally invited, was coming off as awkward. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities like a game of Uno. Despite that, the guest kept standing alone and claimed no one was talking to him. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about it, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort. The question is whether the host is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider social norms and expectations. When hosting a party, the host has the right to manage the environment. If a guest is not engaging and is perhaps being passive or expecting others to make all the social overtures, it's reasonable for the host to set boundaries. However, the guest was a plus one, which might mean he wasn't the one who invited himself. The host did make efforts to include him, but when he refused to participate, it's understandable that the host would feel responsible to ensure the party isn't disrupted. On the other hand, some might argue that the host could have been more patient or found another way without kicking him out immediately. However, given the repeated attempts and the guest's lack of effort, the host might be justified. So, probably the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
