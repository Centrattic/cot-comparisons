I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest was brought by a coworker but didn't really integrate. The guest approached the host twice saying no one is talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest refused. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nThe user is asking if the host is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the host isn't in the wrong. \n\nFirst, consider the host's responsibility. They tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him. The guest didn't take initiative after that. The host's party, so they have the right to set boundaries. If someone isn't making an effort to socialize despite being given opportunities, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or had social anxiety. But the host did attempt to assist. The coworker friend was informed. It's possible the guest felt singled out, but the host isn't responsible for every guest's social skills. \n\nLegally, the host isn't in the wrong for asking someone to leave if they're being a burden. Socially, some might argue it's harsh, but others would say the host is right to prioritize their own event and not let one person disrupt it. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The host isn't in the wrong because they acted to maintain the party's atmosphere and tried to help first.\n"
