I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who kicked the guest out is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe host had a party, and a guest came as a plus one but not officially. He was a friend of a coworker. The guest stood around alone, and the host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone. But after that, he was alone again. The host suggested joining a game, but he refused. The host then told him to leave if he wasn't socializing. The coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the host explained it wasn't their job to chase after him.\n\nHmm. So the guest was not making an effort to socialize despite being offered help. The host tried twice to integrate him but he didn't engage. The host's party is their space, so they might have the right to set boundaries. But maybe the host was too quick to kick him out? The guest might have had social anxiety or other issues, but the host isn't responsible for solving that. However, is it fair to ask someone to leave for not socializing? Maybe the host could have given more time or been more patient. But considering the guest wasn't putting in effort, the host's action might be justified. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the host is responsible for their event and can set expectations for guests to participate. The guest didn't make an effort, so the host had the right to remove him.\n"
