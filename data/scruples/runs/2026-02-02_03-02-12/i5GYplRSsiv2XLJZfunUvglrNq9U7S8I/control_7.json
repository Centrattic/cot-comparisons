I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because he wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, came separately. The host noticed he was standing around awkwardly. They tried to help by introducing him to someone else, but he ended up alone again. The guest claimed no one was talking to him, even after the host suggested joining a game or mingling. Eventually, the host told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend was upset, but the host felt it was justified.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The host did try to integrate the guest initially by asking how he was doing and introducing him to someone. The guest, however, didn't engage further. The host's responsibility is to ensure the party runs smoothly and everyone is comfortable. But does that include forcing someone to socialize? Social settings can be awkward for some, and maybe the guest was just shy or introverted. The host might have overstepped by making him leave, especially if the guest was a plus one or not the main invitee. However, the guest did refuse all suggestions, which might make the host's decision more defensible. The key points are whether the host's actions were reasonable given the context. The host might have alternatives like moving on, but directly telling someone to leave could be seen as harsh. The coworker's reaction adds another layer\u2014maybe the host didn't consider the guest's feelings. So, there's a case for both sides. But the act of kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as inconsiderate. The host's annoyance might have led to a harsh response. So, perhaps the host is in the wrong (A). But maybe the host isn't (B) because they were managing the party. Hmm.\n"
