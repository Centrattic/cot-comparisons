I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The question is whether the author is at fault here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came along with a coworker, but maybe not as a plus one. The guest was standing around alone, and the host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. But the guest kept being alone again despite opportunities to socialize. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nThe key points here are the host's responsibility and the guest's behavior. The host tried to assist the guest by engaging with him and introducing him to others. The guest, however, didn't take initiative to mingle or join activities when suggested. The host's frustration makes sense because they might feel responsible for ensuring the party runs smoothly, but also have limits on how much they can help each individual. \n\nThe guest's behavior could be seen as passive or not taking responsibility for their own social engagement. The host isn't obligated to force social interactions, especially if the guest is resistant. However, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing might come off as harsh, depending on context. But given that the host made multiple attempts to help and the guest wasn't making an effort, maybe the host is justified. \n\nThe coworker friend (the host's coworker) might have a different perspective, but the host's explanation about the guest not trying could be valid. The host isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if the guest was making them uncomfortable or affecting the party's atmosphere. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The host tried to help, and the guest wasn't making an effort. The host is allowed to enforce social expectations up to a point, and if someone isn't participating, they might need to leave.\n"
