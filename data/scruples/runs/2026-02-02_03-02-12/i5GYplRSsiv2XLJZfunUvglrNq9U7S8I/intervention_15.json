I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author hosted a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one of a coworker, came separately. The guest was standing around awkwardly, claimed no one was talking to him. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up alone again. The author suggested joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. Then the author told him to leave if he's just going to stand around. The coworker friend later criticized the author, but the author defended their decision.\n\nSo the key points: Was the guest actually being ignored, or was he not making an effort? The author tried multiple times to help, but the guest didn't engage. The author's response was to ask him to leave. \n\nI need to consider social norms here. When hosting a party, it's reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize. If someone is just standing around and not engaging despite being offered help, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting the event's atmosphere. However, some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author did try to help, and the guest's repeated refusal suggests he wasn't interested in participating. The host has the right to manage their event and ensure it's enjoyable for everyone. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They took reasonable steps to assist and set boundaries when the guest wasn't making an effort. The coworker's criticism might come from a different perspective, but the author's actions seem justified.\n"
