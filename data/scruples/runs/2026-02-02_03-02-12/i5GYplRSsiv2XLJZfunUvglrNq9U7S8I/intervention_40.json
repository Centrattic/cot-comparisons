I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest showed up, maybe a plus one, but not officially. The guest seemed to be isolated, not socializing much. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone. But after a couple of attempts, the guest is still alone and refuses to join in.\n\nNow, the key points here are the efforts made by the author. They first approached the guest when he looked awkward, had a conversation, introduced him to someone with similar interests. Then when he's alone again, they suggested joining a game and mingling, which he refused. The author felt that the guest was just being passive and not making an effort, so they told him to leave if he wasn't going to engage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible angles here are about social responsibility and the expectations at a party. The author was trying to be helpful but might have given up after a couple of attempts. However, the guest wasn't putting in any effort. The author might be justified in not wanting to host someone who isn't contributing or engaging, especially if it's affecting the party's atmosphere. On the other hand, some might say that the author should have made more effort to include the guest, even if it was inconvenient. \n\nBut considering that the guest was a plus one and not a close friend, maybe the author isn't obligated to spend excessive time trying to integrate him. The author was already helpful twice, and when the guest refused further suggestions, it's reasonable to set a boundary. Also, the host has the right to manage the event as they see fit. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
