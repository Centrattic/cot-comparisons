I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest because they weren't socializing. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. He kept standing around alone, even after being introduced and given suggestions. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about it, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guest wasn't socializing, the host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest refused. The host then asked him to leave. The coworker thought it was harsh, but the host felt it was necessary.\n\nNow, considering social norms, hosting a party often involves setting boundaries. The host has the right to ensure their event is enjoyable for everyone. If someone is not participating and making others uncomfortable, asking them to leave isn't unreasonable. However, some might argue that the guest was just socially awkward and the host should have been more accommodating.\n\nBut the guest was given multiple chances\u2014talked to, introduced, and offered activities. Refusing all of them might indicate they weren't interested in engaging. The host's responsibility isn't to force interactions but to maintain a positive environment. So, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is probably B.\n"
