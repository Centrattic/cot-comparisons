I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. I need to determine if the author (A) is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B).\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The host had a party, and a guest came, supposedly as a plus one but not really. The guest kept standing alone, said no one was talking to him, even after the host tried to help by introducing him to someone and suggesting activities. The guest refused to participate and eventually the host told him to leave. The coworker (the friend of the guest) was upset about it.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The host tried to assist the guest by talking to him, introducing him, and suggesting activities. The guest didn't make an effort to engage, even when given opportunities. The host then decided to ask him to leave because they felt responsible but also frustrated. The host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort, and the host couldn't spend all their time helping.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. If someone is a guest at a party, they're expected to make some effort to socialize. If a guest is being left alone, maybe it's their responsibility to approach others. However, the host did try to help. The guest's behavior might be passive or socially awkward, but does that justify the host kicking them out? \n\nAlso, the guest might have legitimate social anxiety or just be an introvert. The host's response could be seen as harsh if the guest was genuinely struggling. But the host's perspective is that they tried, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host felt it was necessary to maintain the party's atmosphere.\n\nThe coworker (the guest's friend) is upset with the host. That complicates things because the host might have to consider their relationship with the coworker. However, the host's main responsibility is to their own event and their own comfort.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, this is a bit of a gray area. The host had the right to ask someone to leave if they felt it was necessary, especially if the person was disruptive. However, the guest wasn't necessarily being disruptive; they were just not participating. The host's frustration is understandable, but maybe the solution of asking them to leave was too harsh. Alternatively, the host had the right to set boundaries, especially if the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment despite being given chances.\n\nFactors to consider: The host tried multiple times to help. The guest didn't make any effort. The host's decision might be seen as reasonable because they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions. However, some might argue that the guest wasn't doing anything wrong except being quiet, and the host could have handled it differently without kicking them out. \n\nIn similar situations, people might have different opinions. Some might side with the host for setting boundaries, others might side with the guest for being excluded. But since the host did make an effort and the guest didn't reciprocate, the host might not be in the wrong. Also, the host is responsible for their own event and can enforce their rules. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
