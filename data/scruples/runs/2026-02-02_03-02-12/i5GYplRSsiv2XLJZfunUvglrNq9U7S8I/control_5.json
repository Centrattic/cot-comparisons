I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest, a plus one but not really, came separately with a coworker. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again. The author tried suggesting activities, but the guest refused. The author got annoyed and told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend was upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author made an effort to include the guest initially. The guest didn't make an effort to integrate despite being given opportunities. The author then decided to ask him to leave when they felt the guest wasn't trying. The coworker friend thought it was harsh, but the author felt it was justified.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The guest was invited, but maybe not as an official invitee. The author's responsibility as a host is to ensure everyone is comfortable, but there's a limit. If the guest is not engaging and is causing discomfort or being a burden, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. However, telling someone to leave can be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was trying but failed. But in this case, the guest refused to mingle or participate even when offered suggestions. The author's argument is that the guest wasn't making the effort, so the author isn't in the wrong for asking them to leave. \n\nThe coworker friend's reaction is that it was \"shitty,\" but the author explained their reasoning. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest wasn't responsive. The host has the right to manage their own party. However, some might argue that the guest was just shy and the author could have handled it more gently. But given the information, the author's actions seem reasonable. So the answer is B (No).\n"
