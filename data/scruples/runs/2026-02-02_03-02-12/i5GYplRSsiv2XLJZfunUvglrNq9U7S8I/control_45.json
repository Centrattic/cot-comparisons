I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the host had a party, a guest came along as a plus one but not officially. The guest was standing around alone. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities like playing a game. But the guest kept being alone and refused to engage. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend of the guest was upset, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if the host was wrong. Let's consider the key points. The host made multiple attempts to help the guest integrate. The guest, on the other hand, didn't reciprocate or make an effort to socialize. The host's party is their own space, and they have the right to set boundaries. However, kicking someone out for being shy or not socializing might be seen as harsh. But in this case, the guest was given opportunities and refused to participate despite the host's efforts.\n\nAnother angle: the guest might have social anxiety or be an introvert, but the host might not know that. However, the host isn't obligated to accommodate someone who isn't contributing to the social environment. The guest's behavior could be affecting the atmosphere of the party, especially if others are uncomfortable or if the guest is being disruptive in a passive way by not engaging. \n\nAlso, the host's coworker is involved. The coworker might feel that the host was too harsh, but the host's perspective is that they tried to help and the guest wasn't making an effort. The line between being a gracious host and managing their own event is important here. The host isn't responsible for forcing social interactions, but if a guest is refusing to engage despite help, the host might feel it's necessary to ask them to leave to maintain the party's vibe.\n\nI think the key here is whether the host was reasonable in their actions. They tried multiple times to assist the guest, but when it's clear the guest isn't participating and is just expecting others to accommodate him, the host's decision to ask him to leave is justified. So the answer would be B, the host is not in the wrong.\n"
