I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post did something wrong by kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, the context: The guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed him standing around awkwardly and tried to help by introducing him to a friend and suggesting activities. However, the guest kept saying he wasn't being talked to and refused to join in. The host got annoyed and told him to leave, which the guest did. The host's coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained they couldn't take time to force social interactions.\n\nNow, considering typical social norms and AITA scenarios. Usually, hosts are expected to make guests feel welcome, but guests also need to make an effort. The host here made several attempts to include the man. The man, on the other hand, didn't engage, even after being introduced and given suggestions. The host's party has other guests and activities, so it's reasonable to set a boundary when someone isn't contributing to the social environment.\n\nIn AITA cases, the host's responsibility is to their own comfort and the event's atmosphere. If a guest is being uncooperative, the host can choose to remove them, especially if it's affecting the host's enjoyment or others'. The key points here are the host's efforts to help and the guest's refusal to participate. The host isn't in the wrong because they provided opportunities for the guest to engage and then set a boundary when those efforts failed.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
