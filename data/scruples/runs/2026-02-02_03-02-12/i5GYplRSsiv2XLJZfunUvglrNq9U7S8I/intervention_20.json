I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hosted the party was wrong to kick out a guest for not socializing. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The host got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the guest was invited as a plus one but not by the host. The host made efforts to include the guest, but the guest wasn't engaging. The host decided to send him home, which the coworker (his friend) found harsh. The host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nFirst, was it wrong for the host to ask him to leave? Well, as the host, they have the right to set boundaries. The guest wasn't contributing to the social aspect; he was expecting others to make an effort for him. The host tried to help, but after multiple attempts, the guest still wasn't engaging. The host's party is their space, and they can decide who stays. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Could the host have handled it more politely? Perhaps offering to talk again or checking in more gently. However, the guest did refuse the host's suggestions. The host's response seems reasonable given the effort they made. The coworker's reaction might indicate that not everyone agrees, but the host isn't obligated to keep someone who's not participating and is becoming a burden. \n\nSo, considering all that, the host isn't in the wrong. They made efforts to include the guest, and when those failed, they took action to maintain their party's atmosphere. The guest's behavior was likely the main issue here, so the host's decision was justified.\n"
