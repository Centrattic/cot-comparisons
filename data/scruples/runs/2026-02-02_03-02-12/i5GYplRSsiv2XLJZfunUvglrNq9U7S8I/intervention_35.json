I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing at their party.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. One guest was a plus one, not officially invited, but joined anyway. The guest seemed awkward and not engaging. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, suggesting joining a game, but the guest refused each time. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker friend was upset about this.\n\nSo, the main points here: The host made multiple attempts to include the guest. The guest kept isolating himself despite the host's efforts. The host felt that the guest was being passive and expecting others to make an effort. The host's reasoning was that they couldn't spend time dragging the guest around to talk to people.\n\nNow, considering social norms and party etiquette. Usually, a host is expected to try to include guests, but there's also a limit when a guest isn't trying to engage. The guest in question didn't put in any effort to socialize beyond standing around. The host tried to be helpful, but after repeated refusals, it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the host had a responsibility to ensure all guests felt welcome, even if it required more effort. The guest might have had social anxiety or other issues. But the host also has the right to manage their event and not let someone's lack of participation disrupt the atmosphere. \n\nFrom the host's perspective, they were managing their own event and felt the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment. The guest's behavior could be seen as passive or expecting others to accommodate him. The host's decision to ask him to leave might be justified if they felt it was affecting the party's vibe.\n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out can be harsh. Perhaps the host could have handled it differently, like having a private conversation to understand the guest's discomfort better or encouraging more gently. But the host did try several times, and the guest didn't respond. \n\nConsidering that the host was also managing other aspects of the party, they might not have the resources to constantly assist one unengaged guest. The coworker's reaction suggests that some might see the host as harsh, but the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort. \n\nI think the key here is mutual effort. The host tried, but the guest refused to engage. In social settings, guests are expected to participate to some extent. If they can't or won't, the host isn't necessarily obligated to keep them around if it's causing discomfort or taking away from the host's ability to enjoy their own event. \n\nTherefore, the host might not be in the wrong here. They made reasonable attempts to include the guest, and after repeated refusals, they had the right to ask the guest to leave to maintain the party's environment. The answer is B.\n"
