I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking whether the author is at fault for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, the situation: the guest was a plus one but came separately. He was awkward and approached the host twice, saying no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest refused. The host then asked him to leave.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The host is organizing the party and has the right to manage the environment. The guest might be socially anxious or not comfortable, but the host did make efforts to include him. However, the guest didn't reciprocate the effort. \n\nIs it wrong to ask someone to leave if they're not engaging? Parties are social events, so if someone isn't participating and is being a burden, the host might feel justified. But some might argue that the guest was being socially awkward and the host was too harsh. \n\nThe host did try to help, so maybe the blame isn't entirely on them. The guest might have needed to make more effort. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they took steps to include the guest and had a right to remove someone who wasn't contributing to the party's social atmosphere. So the answer is B.\n"
