I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation is that the guest was being a plus one but not officially. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to someone else. However, the guest kept standing alone, refused to join activities, and the host eventually told him to leave. The coworker friend of the guest was upset, but the host argued that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They threw the party, so they have some duty to manage the event and ensure guests are comfortable. But also, guests are expected to participate to some extent. The guest in question was a plus one, so maybe there were assumptions about his role. The host tried to engage him twice, once directly and once through a friend, and then suggested a game. The guest refused both times. \n\nThe host's frustration is understandable. If someone is at a social event and refuses to make any effort to interact, it can be seen as disruptive. The host might feel they can't spend all their time facilitating every guest's interactions, especially if they have other responsibilities. However, kicking someone out because they didn't engage might be seen as harsh. Even if the guest wasn't making an effort, the host could have handled it differently, like giving more time or being more patient.\n\nThe coworker's reaction is also a point. The host explained their reasoning, but the coworker thought it was shitty. Maybe the host should have considered the guest's feelings more, especially if the guest was just shy or uncomfortable. But the host might have had their limits. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally not the host's role to force interaction, and guests should take some initiative. However, the host's response was to tell the guest to leave, which is a strong action. It's possible the host overreacted, but also within their rights as the host to manage their event. \n\nSo, the question is whether the host was wrong. If the guest was a plus one, maybe there was an unspoken expectation that they would integrate. But the host also has the right to set boundaries. The key points are the host's attempts to help, the guest's refusal to engage, and the host's decision to remove the guest. The host's action might be justified if they felt the guest was not contributing to the social environment and was expecting others to accommodate him. However, the harshness of the action might be questionable. But considering the host's perspective and the guest's inaction, perhaps the host isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
