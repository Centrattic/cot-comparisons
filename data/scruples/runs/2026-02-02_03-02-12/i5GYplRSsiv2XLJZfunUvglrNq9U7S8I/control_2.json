I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a party where the author kicked out a guest because he wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one of a coworker but came separately. The author noticed he was standing alone, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But after a few attempts, the guest kept being isolated and refused to join activities. The author then told him to leave, and the coworker thought it was harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guest was a plus one, which might mean he wasn't part of the main group. The author did make an effort to include him initially. The guest's behavior was to say he wasn't being talked to, but when asked to mingle or join a game, he refused. The author got annoyed because the guest was passive and didn't make an effort. \n\nIs the author responsible for the guest's social interactions? Maybe the guest is an adult and should take some initiative. The author tried to help, so maybe they're not at fault. On the other hand, maybe the author should be more accommodating, but parties are social events where guests are expected to participate. The guest didn't put in effort, so the author might be justified in asking him to leave. The coworker's reaction is that it was \"shitty,\" but the author explained the situation. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author have the right to kick out someone who was a guest of a friend? If the coworker invited him, maybe the author overstepped. But the party is the author's space, so they might have the right to manage the environment. If the guest was a disruption or not respectful, but here it's more about socializing. The key point is whether the author acted unreasonably. The guest didn't make an effort, so the author might be in the right. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the author set a boundary when the guest wasn't engaging.\n"
