I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hosted the party was wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The host invited friends and coworkers, and a plus one came with a coworker but separately. The guest seemed awkward, the host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up being alone again. The host got annoyed when the guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. The host told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nFirst, the host's responsibility is to ensure the party is enjoyable for everyone. The guest wasn't making an effort to socialize, which could disrupt the atmosphere. The host tried multiple times to help, but the guest wasn't engaging. Hosts often have the right to ask someone to leave if they're causing discomfort or not respecting the event's social norms. The guest's behavior might be seen as passive-aggressive or seeking attention. However, some might argue that the host could have handled it more gracefully, like talking to the coworker first. But given the situation, the host's actions were reasonable to maintain the party's vibe. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
