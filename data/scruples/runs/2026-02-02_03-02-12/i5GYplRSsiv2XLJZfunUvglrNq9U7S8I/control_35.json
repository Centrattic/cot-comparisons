I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came along. He stood around awkwardly, said no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but he refused. The host then told him to leave.\n\nSo, the host's perspective is that the guest wasn't making an effort, just wanted attention, and the host had to maintain the party. The host's reasoning is that it's not the host's job to drag people around to socialize. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained the reasoning.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. On one hand, the guest might have been shy or uncomfortable, but he was given multiple chances to engage. The host tried to help, and when the guest continued to not participate, maybe the host was within their rights to ask him to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's atmosphere. However, maybe the host could have handled it more politely or given a warning first. But the guest did refuse all suggestions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a host, you should make everyone feel included, even if they're struggling. But the host isn't obligated to force socialization. The guest's behavior might be seen as uncooperative. The host's party, their space, so they can set boundaries. \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, the host often isn't in the wrong if they set clear expectations. The guest's lack of effort is on them. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
