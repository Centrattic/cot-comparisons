I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The story says that the guest kept standing around, claimed no one was talking to him, even after being introduced to someone. The host tried a couple of times to help, but the guest refused to engage further. Then the host told him to leave. The coworker friend of the guest was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Hosting a party usually means you're responsible for the atmosphere, but guests also have a role in participating. The host made efforts to include the guest by introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest didn't take those opportunities. If someone is at a party and doesn't make an effort to socialize, maybe that's on them. The host can't be expected to force interactions, especially if they're hosting a large group. \n\nBut then, was it too harsh to kick someone out? If the guest was genuinely struggling to socialize, maybe the host could have given more time or support. However, the guest's response to the host's help was refusal. The host might feel that they can't accommodate someone who isn't contributing to the social environment. Also, the host is responsible for the event's flow, so if someone is not engaging and affecting the vibe, removing them could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a host, you should make an effort to include all guests, even if it's inconvenient. The guest might have been shy or socially anxious. The host could have tried harder to integrate him, like pairing him with others or creating a game where he had to interact. But the host did try once, and the guest didn't follow through. \n\nThe coworker who was the friend of the guest in question is upset, which might suggest that the host's action was seen as harsh. However, if the guest was truly uncooperative, maybe the host had a right to ask them to leave. \n\nI think the key points are: the host tried to help, the guest didn't make an effort, and the host has the right to manage their own event. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
