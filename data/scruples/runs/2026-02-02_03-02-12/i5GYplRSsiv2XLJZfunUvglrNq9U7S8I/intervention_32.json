I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a party where the host kicked out a guest for not socializing. The guest was a plus one, came with a coworker, but they arrived separately. The host tried to help the guest by talking to them and introducing them to someone with similar interests. But the guest kept standing around and refused to join activities. The host then told them to leave, and the guest did. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one, but maybe not everyone expected him to be there. The host tried to include him once, introduced him to someone, but the guest didn't make an effort afterward. The host felt that the guest was expecting others to make all the effort and not contributing to the social environment. \n\nNow, the guest's side: they might have felt awkward or nervous, maybe introverted or not in the mood to socialize. But the host did make an effort to help. The guest's refusal to join in games or mingle again could be seen as not trying to integrate. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the host overstep by asking the guest to leave? Was the guest given enough chance to socialize? The host tried twice\u2014talking and introducing, then suggesting activities. The guest didn't take the initiative. The host's responsibility is to the other guests and the environment. If a guest is being a burden or not contributing, maybe the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave, especially if they're not respectful of others' time. \n\nThe coworker friend thought it was shitty, but maybe she didn't see the context. The host is not in the wrong if they felt the guest wasn't making an effort and the host couldn't be a personal social director for everyone. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
