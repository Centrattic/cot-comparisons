I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing. The author of the story invited friends and coworkers, and one guest, who was a friend of a coworker, was standing around alone. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept being alone and refused to join activities. Eventually, the author told him to leave.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The guest was a plus one but not officially. The author tried multiple times to help him integrate. The guest's behavior was passive; he didn't make an effort to talk to others, even after being introduced and suggested to join a game. The author didn't act out of malice but frustration because the guest wasn't contributing to his own socialization. \n\nHowever, the coworker (his friend) was upset that the author told him to leave. But the author explained that they couldn't be responsible for dragging him around. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to force social interactions. If someone isn't making an effort, the host isn't in the wrong for asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's dynamics. The guest had the agency to approach others but chose not to. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Was the guest genuinely shy or just uninterested? The author assumed the guest wanted to be pitied. But maybe the guest was just struggling in a new environment. Still, the host has the right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate. The host can't be responsible for everyone's social needs. Answer B.\n"
