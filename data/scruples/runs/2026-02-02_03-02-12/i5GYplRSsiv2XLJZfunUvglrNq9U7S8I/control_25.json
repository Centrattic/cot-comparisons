I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who kicked a guest out of their party is in the wrong. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but showed up separately. He kept saying people weren't talking to him, but the host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. When the guest still didn't engage, the host told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party often involves making guests feel welcome, but it's also a host's right to manage their own event. The guest's behavior here seems passive. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't take initiative. Maybe the guest was being passive-aggressive or expecting others to make all the effort.\n\nThe host's actions: after multiple attempts to integrate the guest, they decided he wasn't putting in effort and asked him to leave. Is that reasonable? If someone is not contributing to social interaction and is making the host feel responsible for their discomfort, the host might feel justified in removing them. However, some might argue that as a host, you have a duty to ensure all guests are comfortable, even if it takes more effort.\n\nBut the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host didn't know him beforehand, so maybe the responsibility isn't as heavy. The key points are that the host tried to help multiple times, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host felt the guest was being difficult. In such cases, the host might not be in the wrong. The coworker friend's reaction might be an example of the guest's sensitivity, but the host had the right to enforce social expectations. So the answer might be B, the host is not in the wrong.\n"
