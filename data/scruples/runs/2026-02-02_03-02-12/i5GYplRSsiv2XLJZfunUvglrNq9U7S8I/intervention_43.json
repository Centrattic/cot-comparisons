I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the host was in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The situation is described as a party where a guest, a coworker's friend, came along. The host noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly, tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept being alone again. The host got annoyed and told him to leave, which he did. The coworker (the friend's friend) was upset, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the host's actions. Hosting a party involves managing the environment for all guests. If someone is not contributing to the social dynamics and is a burden, the host might feel justified in removing them. However, social norms usually emphasize politeness and giving people space. The guest might have been shy or introverted, and expecting a stranger to initiate social interactions can be challenging. \n\nThe host's approach was to try to include the guest twice\u2014asking if everything's okay, introducing to a friend, suggesting a game. When those failed, the host decided to tell him to leave. The key points here are whether the host gave enough opportunity for the guest to engage and if the removal was appropriate. \n\nThe guest's refusal to engage in suggested activities (like the game) might indicate a lack of interest or discomfort. However, the host's frustration is understandable, especially if the party was meant to be social. The question is whether the host overstepped by asking him to leave. \n\nIn social settings, it's generally not the host's responsibility to force interactions. However, if a guest is causing discomfort or not respecting the event's purpose, the host has the right to manage the environment. The coworker's friend might have felt targeted, but the host's reasoning was about the guest not making an effort. \n\nConsidering cultural norms, some might argue that the host was too harsh, especially if the guest had valid reasons for being uncomfortable. Others might support the decision to maintain the party's atmosphere. The answer hinges on whether the host's actions were reasonable given the situation. Since the host made multiple attempts to assist and the guest continued to disengage, it's plausible that the host wasn't in the wrong. However, there's a possibility that the guest had valid reasons, but the host's choice to prioritize the party's social success might take precedence.\n"
