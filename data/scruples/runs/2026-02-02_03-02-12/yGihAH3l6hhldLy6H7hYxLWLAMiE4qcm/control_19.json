      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent picks up their daughter from the park at around 6 PM. The daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home, but the parent declined. The key here is whether the parent had any obligation to give the friend a ride. \n\nThe parent's main responsibility is to their own child, so if they agreed to pick up the daughter, that's their priority. The friend's request is probably an afterthought. Maybe the friend didn't ask the parent directly or it wasn't arranged beforehand. The parent might not have known they could take the friend, or maybe they didn't want to take extra time or have their child's friend along. \n\nAge of the daughter and friend could matter. If they're minors, the parent might be concerned about safety or permissions. Also, cultural norms might influence whether it's expected to help a friend's ride. \n\nBut the parent didn't make a promise to the friend. Without prior agreement, the parent isn't obligated. The daughter might feel responsible for her friend, but the parent isn't necessarily at fault for not taking someone they weren't planning to transport. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent isn't in the wrong because they weren't expecting to give the friend a ride and their primary duty is to their child. The answer is B.\n"
