      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question) is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the author picked up their daughter from the park at around 6 PM, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the author declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author had an obligation to give the friend a ride. The author's own daughter needed to be picked up, so the primary responsibility was to her. The friend was there at the park, but it's not mentioned if the author had any prior agreement or commitment to take the friend home. \n\nThe time factor is 6 PM, which might be relevant if the friend's parents expected her to be picked up by then. However, there's no information that the author was supposed to pick up the friend. The friend might have assumed the author would take her, but the author wasn't explicitly asked beforehand or given any indication that they needed a ride home from the park. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes parents might expect that if their child is friends with someone else's child, they might help out, but that's not a given. It's also possible that the friend's parents didn't communicate the need for a ride, so the author couldn't be expected to know. \n\nThe author's priority is their own child, so declining the friend's ride request seems reasonable unless there was a prior understanding. Without more context\u2014like if the friend's parents were involved or if it was an expectation in their community\u2014the author isn't necessarily at fault. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because there's no clear indication of a prior obligation, and their primary responsibility was to their daughter.\n"
