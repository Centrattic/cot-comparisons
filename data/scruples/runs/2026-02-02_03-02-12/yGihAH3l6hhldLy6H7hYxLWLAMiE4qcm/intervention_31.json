      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe scenario is that the parent was picking up their daughter from the park after work. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined, took their daughter home, and it was around 6 PM. The friend was left at the park.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Their main responsibility is their own child. The friend is not their responsibility, so refusing to give a ride might be seen as reasonable. Parents often prioritize their own children's needs and safety. The friend was at the park with the daughter, so maybe they knew the parent was coming to pick up the daughter but not necessarily that they'd take the friend as well. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's friend might have expected the ride home. But the parent didn't have an obligation to do so. It's possible that the friend didn't realize the parent's commitment was only to the daughter. Also, the time was 6 PM, which might be when the park closes or when it gets dark, so leaving someone there could be a concern. But without more info, it's hard to say if there was negligence. \n\nThe parent didn't make a promise to take the friend, so declining isn't inherently wrong. However, maybe the daughter had arranged for her friend to be picked up, putting the parent in a position where they should have known to take both. But the parent's primary duty is to their own child. \n\nSo, the key points are: the parent's responsibility is to their daughter, the friend wasn't under the parent's care, and the parent didn't agree to take her. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. The friend should have made her own arrangements. Unless there's more context like the park being far from home or the friend being in a dangerous situation, the parent isn't at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
