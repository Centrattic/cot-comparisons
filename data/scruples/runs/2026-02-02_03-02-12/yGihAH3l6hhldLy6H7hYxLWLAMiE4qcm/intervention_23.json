      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter after work, and then the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. The daughter wanted to be picked up, so the parent went to the park. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride. The parent said no and then drove the daughter home. The time was around 6 PM. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Is it the parent's responsibility to also take the friend home? Do they have a prior agreement or obligation to do so? The parent's primary duty is to their child. Unless there's a prior understanding that the parent will take the friend as well, it's not their obligation. The friend might not have known the parent's schedule or the parent's willingness to give rides. However, the parent could have offered to drop the friend off on the way home if it was convenient. But since the parent chose not to, does that make them wrong?\n\nAnother angle: The friend might have expected the parent to help since they were picking up their daughter. But the parent is not responsible for the friend. The parent can set boundaries. The problem here is whether the parent had the right to decline. Since they didn't have any prior arrangement, declining seems reasonable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for not being accommodating, but in this case, unless there's a specific reason the parent shouldn't have said no (like the friend was in immediate danger), the parent isn't necessarily at fault. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
