      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. \n\nSo the situation is: The parent was picking up their daughter from the park after work. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined, took their daughter home, and it was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The main duty here is to their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, so it's reasonable that they prioritize their child's needs. The daughter's friend was not under the parent's responsibility; they didn't have any prior agreement to pick up the friend. \n\nThe friend might have expected a ride, but unless there was a prior arrangement, the parent isn't obligated. Also, the parent might not know the friend well enough to feel responsible for her. Safety is a factor too\u2014taking someone else's child home without consent could be an issue. \n\nThe time was 6 PM, which is getting late. The parent might not want to delay picking up their own child or extend the trip unnecessarily. There's no mention of the friend being stranded or in danger. The parent's action seems within their rights since they weren't responsible for the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was okay to ask, but the parent's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The parent's main duty is to their own child. Unless there's more context, like the friend needed help and the parent ignored it, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent was fulfilling their duty to their own daughter and wasn't responsible for the friend. The friend should have arranged her own transportation or checked with her own parents.\n"
