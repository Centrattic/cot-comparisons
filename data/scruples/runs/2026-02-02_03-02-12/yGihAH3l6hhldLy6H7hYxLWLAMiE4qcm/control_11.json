      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent is picking up their daughter from the park after work. It's around 6 PM. The daughter's friend is there and asks for a ride home. The parent declines the friend. Then they take their daughter home.\n\nI need to determine if the parent did something wrong. The key points here are the parent's responsibility and any potential expectations from the friend. The parent's main duty is to their own child. They were coming home from work, so maybe they only intended to pick up their daughter. The friend might have thought they were included, but the parent didn't agree to that. \n\nBut wait, the parent didn't necessarily leave the friend on purpose. They just didn't pick her up because they were there for their daughter. If the friend was left unattended, maybe that's a problem. However, the parent might not be responsible for ensuring the friend gets a ride if they weren't the one who brought the friend to the park or if it's a public place. \n\nAlso, the time is 6 PM. If the park is open until later, the friend could still be there. But if it's getting dark or unsafe, that might be a different scenario. The parent's actions depend on whether they had prior agreement to give the friend a ride. If the friend just asked on the spot and the parent didn't commit to that, then it's not the parent's fault. \n\nAnother angle: the daughter's friend might be a minor. If the parent is responsible for the child's safety, maybe they should have checked if the friend had other plans. But the parent's primary obligation is to their own child. Unless there was an established arrangement, the parent isn't necessarily at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their duty to their daughter and didn't have prior commitment to the friend. However, maybe the parent could have suggested another way to help, like calling the friend's parents. But the question is about being in the wrong, which implies a moral or legal fault. Since the parent didn't promise to take the friend, they aren't obligated. So the answer is B.\n"
