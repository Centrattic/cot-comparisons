      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park.\n\nSo the scenario is that the parent went to the park to pick up their daughter after work. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home, but the parent declined. The key points here are the parent's responsibility and the context of the situation.\n\nFirst, the parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, which they did. The friend's presence is a secondary factor. The parent might not be obligated to give a ride to the daughter's friend unless there was prior agreement or an expectation. \n\nTiming is also a factor. It was around 6 PM, so maybe it's after school hours. The parent might not have anticipated that the friend would need a ride. The daughter's friend might have assumed the parent would take them along, but unless there was a specific arrangement, the parent isn't necessarily at fault.\n\nAnother angle: Did the parent know beforehand that the friend needed a ride? If the daughter didn't inform the parent about the friend needing a ride home, then the parent can't be expected to accommodate that. Also, the parent's main duty is to their child, so declining the friend seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, if the friend was waiting for their parent to arrive and the parent left them, that might be an issue. But the situation isn't clear on that. The parent might not have the obligation to stay or help unless it's their own child's responsibility.\n\nSo considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their duty to their daughter and had no prior commitment to the friend. Answer B.\n"
