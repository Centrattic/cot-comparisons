      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. So, the situation is: the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and there was the daughter's friend who wanted a ride home. The parent said no and only took their daughter. The time was around 6 PM when they picked up the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. They were there to pick up their daughter, so it's reasonable that they prioritized their own child. The friend's need for a ride might be a separate situation. \n\nBut wait, could there be any expectations here? Maybe the parent was supposed to take the friend home as well? If the parent had prior knowledge that the friend needed a ride, then maybe they should have arranged for that. However, the scenario says the friend \"apparently needed a ride home\" when they arrived. The parent declined. So maybe the parent didn't have prior notice. \n\nAlso, safety is a big factor. If the friend is a minor, leaving them at the park is potentially unsafe, especially if it's evening. But the time was 6 PM, which might not be too late depending on the location. However, if the friend is left alone, that could be an issue. But the parent might not be responsible unless they were the one who dropped the friend off or had agreed to take them home. \n\nAnother angle: the daughter's friend is a separate individual. The parent isn't obligated to take the friend home unless they had made prior arrangements. The parent's responsibility is to their own child, so declining the friend's request isn't necessarily wrong. However, if leaving the friend there put them in a dangerous situation, that's a different matter. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If there's no prior agreement to take the friend home, and the parent was only there for their daughter, then the parent isn't at fault. The friend should have arranged their own transportation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
