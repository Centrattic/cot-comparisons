      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent picked up their daughter and the friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was going home from work and picked up their daughter. The friend needed a ride. The parent said no. The time was around 6 PM, which isn't too late. \n\nSo, why would the parent be in the wrong? Well, the friend probably expected a ride since they came to the park where the daughter was. Maybe the parent didn't know the friend or didn't feel comfortable giving a ride. But maybe the parent should have offered to take the friend home anyway. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent isn't obligated to give a ride. They might have their own reasons, like safety, not knowing the friend well, or just not wanting to. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. \n\nThe question is whether declining the friend was inconsiderate. If the parent offered the ride to the daughter's friend and the friend accepted, it's a choice. But if the parent didn't offer and just left the friend there, that could be seen as not helping. Wait, but the friend needed a ride. Maybe the parent should have offered even if they declined. Like, maybe they could have said, \"I can't take you home, but here's a ride-share code\" or something. But the parent didn't do that. \n\nHowever, the parent isn't legally or morally required to help. The daughter's friend isn't their responsibility. The parent might have their own reasons for not giving a ride. Maybe they don't know the friend well, or they have safety concerns. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel wronged if someone doesn't help them when they expected it. But others might say it's not their problem. The parent's daughter might be upset if they didn't help her friend. But the parent's job is to take care of their own child. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong. The friend might have assumed the parent would take them since they were picking up their daughter. But the parent isn't obligated to offer a ride. Maybe the parent should have considered the friend's situation, but declining isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
