      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent picked up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend was there needing a ride. The parent declined to give her a ride, then drove their daughter home. It was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The parent's main obligation is to their own child. When they went to the park, their primary reason was to pick up their daughter. The daughter's friend being there is an extra. Now, whether the parent is responsible for the friend depends on context not provided here. For example, if the parent had prior knowledge or agreement to pick up the friend, that's different. But the scenario says the friend \"apparently needed a ride,\" implying that the friend might have assumed the parent would take her, but the parent didn't know beforehand. \n\nAlso, the parent's daughter might have been the one to mention that the friend needed a ride. If the parent didn't know until arriving, then they weren't in a position to plan. The parent might not have the means or obligation to take another child home unless they were responsible for them. \n\nAnother angle: the time was 6 PM. Depending on the location and whether it's dark, the friend might be left in an unsafe situation. However, the parent isn't necessarily obligated to ensure that. The friend's parents might be responsible for knowing where their child is and providing transportation. \n\nThe parent's action was to pick up their own child, which is their primary duty. The friend's situation isn't the parent's responsibility unless they had agreed to it. So the parent isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
