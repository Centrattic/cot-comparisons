I declined her. \n\nAfter that, I drove my daughter home.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. They went to pick up their daughter, found the friend there who needed a ride, but declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, the parent's main responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, so it's reasonable they focused on that. The friend was there, but the parent didn't have an obligation to give her a ride unless they had specifically agreed beforehand. If the friend just showed up expecting a ride, that's on her. The parent might have been busy or had other plans after picking up their daughter. Also, it's evening, so maybe the parent was in a hurry to get home. The friend should have arranged her own transportation or asked her parents. Since the parent didn't agree to take her, there's no wrong in declining. Unless there's more context like a prior agreement, the parent isn't at fault here.\n"
