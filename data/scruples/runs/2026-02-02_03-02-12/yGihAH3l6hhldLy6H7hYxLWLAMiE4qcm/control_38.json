      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the parent was coming home from work and went to the park to pick up their daughter. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined her. The key points here are: the parent's primary responsibility is their own child, and the friend's need for a ride wasn't their responsibility.\n\nI think the parent isn't obligated to give rides to their daughter's friends unless there's some prior agreement. The friend probably should have arranged her own transportation. Also, the parent might be concerned about safety or not wanting to extend their trip. Since it was around 6 PM, maybe the parent wanted to get their daughter home quickly. The friend might be in a situation where she didn't plan well. \n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, declining a ride isn't necessarily wrong. It's their choice. Unless they had a specific reason to help the friend, like a prior promise or an emergency, they aren't at fault. The friend's situation isn't the parent's responsibility. So, the answer might be B, the parent isn't in the wrong. But maybe some people would say it's unkind. However, legally or morally, they aren't obligated. So I think B is correct.\n"
