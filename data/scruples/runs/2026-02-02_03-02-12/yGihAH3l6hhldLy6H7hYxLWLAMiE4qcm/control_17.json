      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend, who needed a ride, was there. The parent declined to give her a ride and just took their daughter home around six o'clock.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parent's main responsibility is their daughter, so picking her up on time is expected. The friend was at the park but wasn't the parent's responsibility. The parent isn't obligated to give the friend a ride. However, maybe the daughter was okay with her friend staying or maybe the friend was supposed to be picked up by someone else.\n\nBut the key points here are: the parent's primary duty is to their daughter, and they were doing that. There's no mention of the parent promising the friend a ride. The friend might have expected a ride because maybe she asked the daughter, but the parent isn't responsible for that. Unless there was a prior agreement, the parent isn't in the wrong for not offering a ride. Also, the time was around six, which might be when the friend's parents expect her home. If the friend didn't have other transportation, that's a problem, but the parent isn't necessarily at fault unless they were responsible for her. So in this case, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
