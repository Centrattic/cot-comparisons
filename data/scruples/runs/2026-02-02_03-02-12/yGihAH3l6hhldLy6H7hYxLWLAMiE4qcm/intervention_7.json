      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. So, the situation: the author picks up their daughter from the park after work, and there's a friend who needs a ride home. The author declines the friend, takes their daughter home, and it's around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was going to pick up their daughter, which is their responsibility. The daughter's friend was at the park too, but the author wasn't necessarily responsible for her. The friend needed a ride, but the author didn't take her. The key points here are intent and responsibility.\n\nThe author's primary duty is to their daughter. If the friend was at the park unsupervised, maybe there's an issue. But the problem is that the author wasn't the friend's parent or guardian. Unless there was an agreement beforehand to take the friend home, the author isn't obligated. Also, the friend could have asked someone else or waited for her own parent. \n\nHowever, if the friend was left alone at the park at 6 PM without any means to go home, that might be a concern. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't know the friend needed a ride until they arrived, and there was no prior arrangement, then declining isn't necessarily wrong. The friend might have been responsible for informing her parents or using another method. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have offered to call the friend's parents or suggested an alternative. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The author just declined. Since the author isn't responsible for the friend, it's not their fault. Unless there's a cultural norm or expectation that friends should help each other in such situations, but that's more subjective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
