      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park.\n\nSo the situation is that the parent went to the park to pick up their daughter. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was also there and wanted a ride home, but the parent declined. The key point here is that the parent only agreed to pick up their own daughter. They didn't have any prior obligation to the friend, right? The friend probably just assumed that since the parent was picking up their daughter, they'd also take the friend, but the parent wasn't responsible for that. \n\nI should consider the context: it was around 6 PM, which is when the parent picked up their daughter. The parent might have had their own schedule or reasons for not wanting to take another child. Also, the parent's main responsibility is their own child. They didn't volunteer to be the friend's ride, so it's up to the friend to arrange her own transportation. The parent isn't in the wrong here because they weren't obligated to help the friend. The friend might have been expecting it, but that's not the parent's fault. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
