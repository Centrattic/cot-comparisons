      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent picked up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home. The parent declined, then drove the daughter home. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, which is a primary duty. The friend was not their child, so the parent isn't legally obligated to provide transportation. Maybe the parent didn't know the friend well and felt it was safer not to offer a ride. There's also the timing\u20146 PM might be when the friend's parents are expecting them, and maybe the friend had other transportation options.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have felt disappointed or upset if they were hoping for a ride. But the parent wasn't the friend's parent. The parent might not have wanted to get involved in another family's logistics. Also, if the parent had agreed, there could be liability issues or concerns about safety. The parent might not have known the friend's family well enough to be comfortable transporting them.\n\nI should also think about social norms. Sometimes, people might expect neighbors or other parents to help out occasionally, but it's not a given. The parent isn't in the wrong for declining unless there was a prior agreement or expectation. Since the friend was with the daughter, maybe the parent assumed the friend had other plans. Alternatively, if the friend was in a situation where they couldn't get home, that might change things, but the post doesn't mention that.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably or inconsiderately without justification. Here, the parent's action seems reasonable. They prioritized their own child and didn't have a duty to help the friend. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
