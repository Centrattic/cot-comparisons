      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. \n\nThe situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, there was the daughter's friend who wanted a ride home. The parent declined, took their daughter home, and it was around six o'clock when they picked her up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, and the friend was not their responsibility. The parent might not be obligated to give the friend a ride unless there was an expectation set beforehand. \n\nThe timing is around six, so maybe the friend had other plans or needed to be home by a certain time. But the parent didn't know about that unless the friend had communicated it. If the friend didn't tell the parent that they needed to be picked up, then the parent can't be blamed for not assuming that. \n\nAlso, the parent's daughter was the one who needed to be picked up, so the primary duty was to her. Unless there was a prior agreement that the parent would also take the friend home, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some people might argue that it's good to be considerate. But from the information given, there's no indication that the parent was aware of the friend's need for a ride. The friend might have expected the parent to know, but that's not the case here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their duty to their daughter and the friend didn't have an established agreement for a ride. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
