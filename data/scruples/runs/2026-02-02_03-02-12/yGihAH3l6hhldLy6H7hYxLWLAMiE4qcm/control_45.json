      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. So, the scenario is that the author went to the park to pick up their daughter, and there was the daughter's friend there who needed a ride home. The author declined to give her a ride. The key points here are the context and possible expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there was any prior agreement or understanding. The question doesn't mention that the friend was expecting a ride. If the daughter's friend just happened to be there and asked, maybe the author wasn't responsible to provide transportation. Also, the time was around six, so maybe it's getting dark, but the author didn't mention that as a factor. \n\nAnother angle is whether the friend's need was urgent or if there were other options available. If the park is in a safe area, perhaps the friend could have waited for her own transportation. However, if the friend had no other means, that might be different. But the question doesn't specify that. \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, sometimes people might expect that if you're picking up a child, you might offer a ride to their friend. But that's not a strict rule. It's more of a kindness gesture. The author isn't necessarily obligated unless they had agreed beforehand. \n\nAlso, considering the parent's responsibility, they might be focused on their own child's needs. The daughter might have wanted to stay longer or needed to get home for other reasons. The parent isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own child's schedule unless there was a clear commitment to the friend.\n\nSo, unless there was an explicit agreement or the situation was unsafe, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would likely be B, No.\n"
