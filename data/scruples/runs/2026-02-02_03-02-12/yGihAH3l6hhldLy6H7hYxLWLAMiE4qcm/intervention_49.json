      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent picked up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend wanted a ride home. The parent declined, and then took their daughter home around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was going to pick up their daughter, so the primary responsibility here is to the daughter. The friend of the daughter is there, but the parent wasn't necessarily responsible for her. Unless there's an established expectation that the parent would give rides to the daughter's friends, the parent might not be obligated. \n\nBut maybe there are other factors. For example, was the friend left in a dangerous situation? The park at 6 PM might be okay, but depending on the area, it could be unsafe. However, the parent's main duty is to their own child. If the friend needed a ride, the parent could have asked if there's another way, like a parent picking her up, but not necessarily feeling compelled to take her unless they agreed to beforehand.\n\nAlso, the daughter's friend might have assumed the ride was part of the deal since the parent was picking up her friend. But unless the parent explicitly said they'd take the friend home, the parent isn't necessarily at fault. The key here is whether there was an expectation. If the daughter regularly brings friends home with her and the parent usually does, then maybe the parent is in the wrong. But the post doesn't mention that. The parent only mentions declining the friend after arriving to pick up their daughter.\n\nSo, without prior agreement, the parent isn't in the wrong. They were doing their duty to their own child. The friend should have arranged her own transportation. The answer is probably B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
