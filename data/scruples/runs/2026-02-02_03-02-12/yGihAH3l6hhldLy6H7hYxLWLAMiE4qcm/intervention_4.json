      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent went to the park to pick up their daughter, and there was the daughter's friend there who asked for a ride, but the parent declined. The question is whether the parent did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their own child, which is their responsibility. The friend was not their child, so maybe they aren't obligated to give rides. Also, the time was around 6 PM, which might be when the parent is ending their workday. Maybe they were just focused on getting their daughter home. \n\nBut why would the parent decline the friend? Is there a reason? Maybe the parent didn't know the friend well, or there's a policy not to give rides to other kids. Or maybe they thought it was their daughter's responsibility to look after the friend. But in some cases, if the friend is relying on that ride, the parent's refusal might leave the friend stranded. However, the parent isn't necessarily responsible for the friend. \n\nThe friend needed a ride, but the parent isn't the friend's parent. So unless there's some prior agreement or expectation that the parent would give rides to other kids, the parent isn't in the wrong. The main responsibility here is to their own daughter. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the parent should have considered if the friend had another way home. But unless the parent knew that the friend had no other options, declining might be acceptable. The friend might have other means, or the parent could have asked, but the parent might not feel responsible. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's primary duty is to their own child. They weren't obligated to help the friend. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
