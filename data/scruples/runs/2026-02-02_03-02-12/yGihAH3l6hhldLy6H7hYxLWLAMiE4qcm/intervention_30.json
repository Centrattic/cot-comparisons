My daughter wanted to be picked up so I drove over to the park (where she was at). \n\nWhen I got there, there was this other who was my daughter's friend. She apparently needed a ride home. I declined her. \n\nAfter that, I drove my daughter home. Another important detail is that it was around six a clock at the time I picked my daughter up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. They picked up their daughter but didn't take the friend home. So, the key points here are context and expectations.\n\nFirst, the parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, so it's reasonable that they focused on that. The friend was there, but the parent didn't have an obligation to take her home unless there was prior agreement or expectation. \n\nTiming is around 6 PM, which is getting dark in many places. But the parent didn't know where the friend lived or if she had other plans. Maybe the friend expected the parent to take her, but without prior communication, that's an assumption. The parent might not have known if the friend needed a ride or if she had other transportation.\n\nAlso, the parent's main duty is to their child. Unless they had a history of taking the friend home, it's not their responsibility. The friend should have arranged her own transportation, especially if she knew the parent was only there for the daughter.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. They were doing their duty by their child. The friend might need to manage her own logistics in the future.\n"
