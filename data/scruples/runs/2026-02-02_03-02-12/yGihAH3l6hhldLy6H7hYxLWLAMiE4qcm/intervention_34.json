      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home. The parent declined, then took their daughter home. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their daughter. When they went to the park, the main purpose was to pick up their child. The friend's presence might have been unexpected. The parent might not have known the friend's parent was supposed to pick her up, or maybe they didn't want to get involved in someone else's child's transportation. \n\nBut then, the friend needed a ride. If the park closes at a certain time or if the friend was left alone, that could be an issue. However, the parent could have checked if the friend was okay or offered to contact her parents. But the parent just left. The key here is whether the parent had any prior obligation or agreement to take the friend home. \n\nIf the parents had no prior arrangement, then it's understandable they focused on their own child. However, if the friend was left waiting and it was obvious she needed help, the parent might be expected to do something. But the post doesn't mention the parent refusing help entirely\u2014just that they declined the ride. The friend might have been able to find another way home, but if it's late and the park is closing, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the time is around 6 PM. Depending on the location, parks might have limited hours or get dark. If the friend was stranded because her own parents didn't show up, the parent might not be responsible. However, if the daughter was done and the friend was still there, maybe the parent could have stayed longer or offered assistance. \n\nBut the parent's main duty is to their own child. They might not have the responsibility to ensure the friend gets home. However, the act of declining the ride could be seen as not being considerate. The answer might depend on cultural norms or if the parent had a prior agreement. Since the post doesn't provide more details, the parent might not be in the wrong, but maybe should have considered the friend's situation more. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the parent's primary responsibility is their own child. Unless there was a prior agreement to take the friend, the parent isn't obligated. But maybe the friend was in a vulnerable situation, so the parent could have checked in. However, the post doesn't indicate the parent was unkind. So overall, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
