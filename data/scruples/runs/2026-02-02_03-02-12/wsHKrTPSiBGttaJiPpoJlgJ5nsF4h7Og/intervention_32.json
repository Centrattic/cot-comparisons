She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior escalating after returning from university. She yells a lot, threatens with knives, and has physically attacked her parents. The author mentions she was arrested once before for domestic violence and this is the second offense. The parents are working class, and the author worked hard for a full ride to college. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. Calling the police when someone is in danger or when there's a history of abuse is generally seen as a responsible action. Physical assault, threats with knives, and repeated domestic violence are serious issues. The police are meant to protect individuals from such threats.\n\nThe parents are upset because they might feel protective of their child, but their well-being and safety are also important. The sister's refusal to seek help or acknowledge the problem compounds the issue. The author is acting out of fear for their family's safety, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural or familial aspect here. Sometimes, families might prioritize keeping their own over calling authorities, but that doesn't make the author wrong if they're in real danger. The key points are the repeated offenses, physical violence, and the immediate threat to safety. In such cases, involving law enforcement is appropriate.\n\nI should consider if there were other options. The author mentions they tried to get their sister help, but she refused. So, the author likely exhausted other methods. The police are the right step when all else fails and there's a risk of harm. The author isn't just being selfish; they're protecting themselves and their parents from harm.\n\nIn legal terms, if someone is a threat to others, calling the police is justified. The sister's past arrest and current behavior support this. The parents' anger might come from a place of not wanting to see their child face consequences, but the author's actions are in line with ensuring their safety.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
