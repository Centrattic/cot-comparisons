She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (who called the police on their sister) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of screaming, yelling, and even physical violence towards the family. The parents have a hard time saying no, and they ended up funding her education in Australia. The author worked hard for a full ride to college to avoid burdening the parents. The sister has hit the parents and threatened them with knives, leading the family to not keep knives at home anymore. The author called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence the first time. Now, the parents are upset because the author \"ruined her life.\"\n\nThe key points here are the sister's abusive behavior and the author's actions to protect themselves and their parents. The sister's actions involve physical assault and threats, which are serious. The author called the police because they feared for their safety, especially since the sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the author is ruining their daughter's life, but the author is trying to protect the family from ongoing abuse.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, calling the police in a situation where someone is threatening or physically harming family members is generally seen as the right action. The author isn't just making a minor complaint; they're reporting criminal behavior. The sister's actions cross into domestic violence, which is a legal issue. The parents might prioritize family over safety, but the author has a responsibility to themselves and their parents to ensure their safety.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and her continued abusive behavior make the situation more severe. The author's actions are a response to ongoing threats and violence, not a petty argument. It's important to consider that domestic violence is a serious issue, and contacting authorities is a legitimate step to take when safety is at risk.\n\nHowever, the parents' reaction might be due to cultural or personal values where family harmony is prioritized over legal intervention. But from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting crimes. Also, the sister's prior arrest means there's a history of abuse, making the author's actions a way to prevent further harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong. They took necessary steps to protect their family from an abusive sibling. The parents' anger might stem from their inability to handle the situation themselves, but the author's actions are justified given the sister's violent behavior.\n"
