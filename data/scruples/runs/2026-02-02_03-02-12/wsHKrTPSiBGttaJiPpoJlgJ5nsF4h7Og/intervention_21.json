She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by calling the police on their sister. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has been acting out with screaming, yelling, and even physical assault on the parents. The parents won't stand up to her, so the author took matters into their own hands.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and this is her second offense, the author reporting her might be within their rights. Especially if there's a threat of physical harm, like with knives, then calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. The police are supposed to handle domestic violence cases, so the author isn't necessarily breaking any laws here.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author mentions fearing for their and their parents' well-being. If the sister is threatening violence and has acted on it before, the author's actions could be seen as protective. The parents might feel betrayed, but they were unwilling to intervene, so the author might feel compelled to do so.\n\nHowever, the parents are angry, thinking the author ruined their sister's life. But in cases of domestic violence, especially with a prior offense, the legal system is supposed to handle repeat offenders. The author's responsibility is to their own safety and their parents', which could justify the action.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help complicates things. If she's not getting help, then the situation could escalate further. The author's action might prevent more harm. But some might argue that there's no other way to resolve it, but given the physical threats, it's a necessary step.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their family from a dangerous situation. The answer should be B.\n"
