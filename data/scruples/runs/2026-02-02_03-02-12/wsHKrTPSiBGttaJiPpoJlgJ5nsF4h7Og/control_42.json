She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and this has gotten worse after she came back from university. She has a habit of screaming and throwing tantrums, which is causing a lot of stress in the household. The author mentions that their parents won't stand up to her, even though they're working class and worked hard to support her education. The sister even physically assaults the parents and the author is afraid for their safety. The author called the police for the second time because of these incidents, leading to the sister's arrest. Now the parents are angry at the author for ruining their sister's life. The sister refuses help and thinks the family is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's abusive behavior, the parents' inability to set boundaries, the author's actions to involve the police, and the resulting family conflict. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions\u2014yelling, threatening with knives, physical assault\u2014are serious. Domestic violence is a criminal matter, so calling the police when there's a threat to safety is typically the right step. The author mentions fearing for their safety and that of their parents, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement. The sister has already been arrested once for domestic violence, so the situation is a repeat offense, which might indicate a pattern of dangerous behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. Family dynamics can complicate things, especially if there's a history of enabling behavior. However, the author's primary responsibility is their own safety and that of their family. If the sister's actions are criminal, then reporting it is necessary regardless of family tensions. The author also tried to get her help before, but she refused, so there's an effort to address the issue non-judicially first.\n\nI should consider whether there were other options. The author tried to get her to seek help, which is commendable, but when that fails and there's ongoing abuse, legal intervention is appropriate. The police are supposed to handle domestic violence situations, and if there's a history, a second arrest might be warranted. The author isn't just calling the police on a whim; it's due to genuine threats and physical violence. \n\nAnother angle: the parents are upset because they might feel protective of their child, but their enablement (letting her have her way despite tantrums) allowed the situation to escalate. The author might be standing up for their safety against a family member's abuse. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, from a legal standpoint, reporting domestic violence is the correct action. From a moral standpoint, prioritizing personal safety over family tensions can be justified, especially when there's a history of abuse. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they've tried to help the sister and now are taking necessary steps to protect themselves. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
