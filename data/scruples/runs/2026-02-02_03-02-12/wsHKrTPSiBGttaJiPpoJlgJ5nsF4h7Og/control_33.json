She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies who has a temper, yells a lot, and even physically attacks the family. The author called the police again, leading to the sister's arrest, which has made their parents upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence and now this is a second offense. If there's physical assault, that's a criminal matter. Calling the police to protect oneself and family from domestic violence isn't illegal. In fact, it's a responsible action when safety is at risk.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is prioritizing their safety and their parents' well-being. The sister's behavior is abusive and harmful. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, which isn't healthy. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to break this cycle, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nBut the parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. However, allowing continued abuse might be more harmful in the long run. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things. The author's actions could be seen as the right choice to enforce boundaries and ensure safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They took appropriate steps to address a dangerous situation. The parents' anger is understandable but doesn't make the author at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
