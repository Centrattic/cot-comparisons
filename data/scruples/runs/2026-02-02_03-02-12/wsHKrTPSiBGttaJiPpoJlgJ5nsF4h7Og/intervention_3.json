She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister being abusive, both emotionally and physically. The sister has a history of yelling, threatening with knives, and even a prior arrest for domestic violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands every time she throws a tantrum. The author took the step of calling the police again after the sister assaulted the parents and destroyed property, which led to the parents being upset because they feel the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. If the sister is engaging in physical violence, that's a serious issue. Calling the police when there's a threat to safety is a responsible action, especially if there's a history of violence. The author mentions the sister has been arrested before, which might indicate a pattern of behavior that law enforcement should address. The parents' reaction is based on their feelings about ruining their child's life, but the author's primary concern is their own and their parents' safety. \n\nThere's a balance between family loyalty and self-preservation. The author worked hard to avoid putting their parents in debt, so they might have a different perspective on the sister's behavior. The sister's refusal to seek help despite the problems suggests she's not taking responsibility, which might make the author's actions justified.\n\nI should also consider the context of domestic violence. In many jurisdictions, it's not only acceptable but encouraged to call the police in such situations to protect oneself and others. The author's fear for their well-being is a valid reason for taking that step. The parents might not fully understand the severity, possibly due to enabling their daughter's behavior. \n\nHowever, there's the cultural aspect of family dynamics. In some cultures, protecting family is paramount, which could explain the parents' anger. But the law doesn't typically prioritize family loyalty over safety. The author might be seen as a victim trying to prevent further abuse rather than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the author's actions seem justified. They acted to stop abuse and protect their family, which is a reasonable response. The sister's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's decision to involve law enforcement.\n"
