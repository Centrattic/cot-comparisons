She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissism, materialism, and now more severe behavior after being abroad. She's yelling a lot, threatening with knives, physically assaulting parents, and destroying property. The parents won't stand up to her, and the author is scared for their safety. They called the police a second time, leading to arrest because of domestic violence.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. The sister refuses help. The author worked hard for a full ride, while the sister's parents funded her expensive studies, which might add to the stress.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there are credible threats of violence, especially with weapons, calling the police is a responsible action. The author mentions fearing for their safety, which is a valid reason to involve authorities. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and the sister's previous arrest suggests a pattern.\n\nThe parents' anger might stem from cultural or family dynamics where they prioritize protecting their child over safety. But the author's duty to protect themselves and their parents is important. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things, but the immediate threat is real.\n\nSo, considering the threat to safety and the sister's history, the author's action seems justified. They're prioritizing safety over family harmony, which is understandable. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
