She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after being abroad. She yells a lot, screams when she doesn't get her way, and even hits the parents and destroys property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums. The author mentions that the sister has a history of domestic violence, including threatening to use knives. They've already called the police once before, and now the author did it again because they were scared for their safety.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. The sister refuses to seek help. The author's question is whether they're the asshole for wanting to get her out of their lives.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if someone is a threat to the safety of the family, calling the police when there's a history of violence is probably justified. The sister has been arrested before for domestic violence, so this is a second offense. The author is protecting themselves and their parents from abuse. The parents might be in denial or enabling her, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for taking action to stop the abuse.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, family issues are handled internally, and involving authorities might be seen as disrespectful. But given the context of physical threats and previous arrests, the author's actions are about safety. The sister's behavior is abusive, and the author is trying to break the cycle. The parents' anger seems misplaced because they're prioritizing their daughter over the safety of others.\n\nI think the key points are the history of violence, the author's reasonable fear, and the necessity of legal intervention. The sister's refusal to seek help and the parents' enabling exacerbate the situation. So the author is justified in calling the police. Answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
