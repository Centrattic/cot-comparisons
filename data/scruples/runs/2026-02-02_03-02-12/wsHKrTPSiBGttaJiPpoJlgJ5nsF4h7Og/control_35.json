She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, hits the parents, destroys property, and has even threatened them with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author called the police the second time she assaulted them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has already been arrested once for domestic violence and this is a second offense, then the author is reporting a crime. The sister's actions\u2014physical assault, threatening with knives\u2014could be considered criminal. So calling the police in that case might be a legal obligation, especially if there's a history of abuse. The author mentions fearing for their safety, which adds to the justification for reporting.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life. But the sister has a pattern of abusive behavior and refuses help. The author is trying to protect their family from further harm. Even if the parents are conflicted, the author is acting to stop harm, which is generally seen as right.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' enabling behavior. They keep giving in to the sister's tantrums, which might contribute to the cycle of abuse. The author might feel frustrated that they're not taking action, leading the author to step in. While it's possible the author could have tried other methods first, given the history of violence, calling the police seems necessary when other approaches have failed.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help is also a factor. Since she's not willing to address her issues, the author's actions are a last resort. The key points here are the sister's criminal behavior and the author's intent to protect their family. In many cases, reporting domestic violence is encouraged, especially when there's a pattern and previous arrests.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They took action to stop ongoing abuse and protect their family, which is a responsible and justified response. The answer should be B.\n"
