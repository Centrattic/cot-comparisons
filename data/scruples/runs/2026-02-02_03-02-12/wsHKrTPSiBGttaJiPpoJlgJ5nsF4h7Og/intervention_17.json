She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister who's been acting out, being physically violent, and the parents enabling her. The author called the police a second time because they were worried for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister has a history of verbal abuse, physical assault, and destruction of property. She's been arrested once before for domestic violence. The parents refuse to set boundaries, and the sister even threatens to attack with knives, leading the family to remove knives from the house. The author acted out of fear for their safety and the safety of their parents. \n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But the author's actions were to protect themselves and their family from ongoing abuse. Legally, if someone is in danger, calling the police is a reasonable response. The sister has been violent, and the author has a right to safety. \n\nThe sister refuses help, which complicates things, but that doesn't excuse the violent behavior. The author tried to get her help before, but she refused. The police were called not just out of spite but because there's a documented pattern of abuse. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is protecting their family. They're not the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
