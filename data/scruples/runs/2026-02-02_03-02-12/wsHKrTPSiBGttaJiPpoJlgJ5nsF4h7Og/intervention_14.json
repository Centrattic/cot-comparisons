She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation described is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic and materialistic behavior that's gotten worse after studying abroad. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, destroys property, and has threatened to use knives. The author mentions that the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, and this is the second time they've called the police. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life, but the author is concerned about their own and their parents' safety.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if someone is in imminent danger or there's a history of domestic abuse, calling the police is usually the right move. The author mentions fearing for their safety and the parents' well-being. The sister's actions, especially hitting parents and threatening with knives, are serious offenses. Also, the fact that she refused help and continues to act this way suggests a pattern of harmful behavior.\n\nThe parents might feel conflicted because they want to protect their child but also their other child. However, the author's actions were to prevent further harm. While family dynamics can be complex, the sister's behavior crosses into criminal territory, and the author's response is a legal and responsible action to seek protection. The author isn't the one causing harm here; they're trying to stop it. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
