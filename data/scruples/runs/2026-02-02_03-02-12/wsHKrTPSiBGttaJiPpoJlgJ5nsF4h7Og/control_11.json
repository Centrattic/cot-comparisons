She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, physical aggression, and previous arrests for domestic violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums. The author felt they had to call the police again because of ongoing threats and actual physical assaults. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's a pattern of domestic violence and threats, calling the police is a valid action to ensure safety. The author mentions their sister was already arrested once before, so this is a repeat offense. The police are meant to handle such situations to protect individuals from harm. \n\nThe author's motivation is self-protection and the safety of their family, which is understandable. The parents' anger might stem from cultural factors or their own feelings about their child, but that doesn't negate the need for action against abuse. The sister's refusal to seek help and continued behavior makes the situation more serious. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong here. They took the necessary step to address domestic violence, which is a criminal matter. The parents' conflict with the author is part of the family dynamics but doesn't make the author the asshole. The key points are the repeated abuse, the sister's refusal to change, and the legitimate fear for safety. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
