She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and violent behavior, including physical assaults and destruction of property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands after her tantrums. The author called the police a second time because of genuine fear for their safety and their parents'.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is being physically assaulted and the police were called, that's a domestic violence situation. The sister was already arrested once before for domestic violence, so this is a second offense. Legally, calling the police in such cases is a responsible action to ensure safety. The author has a right to protect themselves and their family from harm.\n\nNext, the emotional and psychological impact. The sister's behavior is extreme\u2014yelling constantly, threatening with knives, and refusing help. The parents' enabling could be due to cultural factors or fear, but the author isn't responsible for the parents' actions. The author is taking steps to address the situation after previous attempts failed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are clearly abusive. The author's intent was to protect their family, not to harm their sister for no reason. While calling the police might have consequences, it's a justified response to ongoing violence. The parents being upset is understandable but doesn't mean the author is wrong.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried more non-confrontational methods. But the sister refused help and had prior arrests. The author had already tried getting her to seek help, which she refused. So, the police call was a last resort.\n\nIn conclusion, protecting oneself and family from abuse is not being an asshole. The author's actions were necessary for safety, so the answer is B.\n"
