She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, threatens physical violence, and has even hit her parents. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author took action by calling the police a second time because they feared for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and is threatening with weapons, calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. The author mentions this is her second offense, so there's a pattern of behavior. Legally, reporting domestic abuse is not only allowed but encouraged to prevent further harm.\n\nThen, there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they feel the action ruined the sister's life. But their enabling might be part of the problem. The author is protecting their own well-being and their parents' by taking action. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things, but the author isn't responsible for her choices.\n\nEmotionally, the sister's behavior is abusive. The author is in a stressful situation where their safety is at risk. Calling the police is a proactive measure against potential violence. The fact that the sister has already been arrested once shows a recurring issue that the family hasn't managed to control otherwise.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried other methods first. But given the sister's refusal to seek help and the escalating threats, the author's actions are justified. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or personal beliefs about family loyalty, but that doesn't make the author wrong for prioritizing safety.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They took necessary steps to protect themselves and their family from a dangerous situation. The sister's behavior is the root issue here, not the author's response to it.\n"
