She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe sister is 21, came back from university abroad, and her behavior has gotten worse. She's described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a habit of screaming tantrums. The author mentions that the sister yells at them for things like leaving the room or not closing the door. Every morning, the sister's yelling wakes them up. The parents won't stand up to her, just give in whenever she throws a fit. The parents are working class, and the sister's lifestyle was funded by them, while the author worked hard to get a full ride to college to avoid putting debt on the parents.\n\nThe most serious part is that the sister physically assaults the parents and destroys property. The author calls the police a second time, leading to an arrest. The sister had been arrested before for domestic violence. The author mentions that the sister threatened to attack with knives, so they don't keep knives at home. The parents are angry because they think the author ruined their sister's life. They tried to get the sister help, but she refused.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone is in immediate danger or there's a history of violence, calling the police is appropriate. The sister's actions include physical assault and destruction of property, which are criminal acts. The author's fear for their own and parents' safety is justified, especially with prior arrests and threats.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are upset, feeling that the author ruined their daughter's life. However, the author's actions were to protect the family from ongoing abuse. The sister's refusal to seek help compounds the problem. The parents enabling the sister's behavior by not setting boundaries could be a factor here. But the author's decision was based on safety, not just personal dislike.\n\nThe key points are the history of violence, the sister's refusal to change, and the immediate threat. Legally, calling the police in such a case is a reasonable step. The parents' anger is more about the consequences for their daughter rather than the safety of the family. The author's actions were to prevent further harm, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
