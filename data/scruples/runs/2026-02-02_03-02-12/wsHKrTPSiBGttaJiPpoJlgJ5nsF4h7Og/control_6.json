She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's gotten worse after studying abroad. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and has threatened them with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author feels they can't handle it anymore, so they called the police for the second time. The sister was previously arrested for domestic violence. The parents are upset with the author, thinking they ruined their sister's life.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's abusive behavior, the author's fear for their safety, and the prior incident. The author's action was to call the police again because the sister's actions are threatening the family's well-being. The parents are in denial and support the sister, which adds complexity.\n\nNow, considering the law and ethics. If someone is in immediate danger or has been a victim of domestic violence, calling the police is a valid and responsible action. The sister's history of violence and threats makes the situation more severe. The author is trying to protect themselves and their parents from harm. The parents might not be in the right for enabling the sister, but the author's action was to seek legal help when other methods failed.\n\nHowever, the sister's side isn't fully known. Maybe there's more context, but based on the given info, the author's actions seem justified. The police are meant to handle such threats. So, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, was the police call an overreaction? But given the sister's history, threats with knives, and physical assaults, it's a reasonable step. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
