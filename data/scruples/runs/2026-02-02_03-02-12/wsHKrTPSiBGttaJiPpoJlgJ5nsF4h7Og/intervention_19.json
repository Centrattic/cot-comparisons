She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after being abroad. She yells a lot, has physical alter outbursts, hits the parents, destroys property, and even threatened to use knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police twice, leading to an arrest, and now the parents are upset, thinking they ruined her life. The author wants to get her out of their lives.\n\nFirst, the key points: The sister is engaging in behavior that's violent and abusive. The author is acting to protect themselves and their parents. The sister has a history of domestic violence, with a previous arrest. The parents are not standing up to her. The author had to work hard for their education, while the sister's lifestyle is funded by the parents. The sister refuses help. \n\nLegally, if there's a threat of violence, calling the police is a valid action. The author mentions the sister threatened knives, which is a serious threat. Physically assaulting parents is also a crime. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect their family from an abusive sibling. The parents might be in denial or enabling the behavior, but the author's actions are to prevent harm. The sister's refusal to seek help exacerbates the issue. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or emotional reasons, but the author isn't obligated to protect their feelings over their safety. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author could have handled it differently, but given the sister's history and the threats, calling the police is a reasonable step. The sister's behavior is criminal, so the author isn't the one causing harm. The parents' enablement doesn't make the author responsible for the sister's actions. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They took necessary steps to ensure safety, especially with the criminal history and ongoing threats.\n"
