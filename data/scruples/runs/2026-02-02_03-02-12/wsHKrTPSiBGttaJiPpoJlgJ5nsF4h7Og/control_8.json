She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's gotten worse since returning from university. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and there's mention of a previous arrest for domestic violence. The author called the police again because they were scared for their safety and their parents' well-being. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life, but the author feels they're protecting themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister has a history of domestic violence, including physical assault and threats with knives. The author called the police the second time. The parents are not standing up to the sister and are instead enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author is trying to protect themselves and their parents from harm.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone is in immediate danger or witnessing domestic violence, calling the police is the responsible action. The sister has already been arrested once, which suggests the police have intervened before. The author's fear of knives and the sister's past threats would likely be taken seriously by law enforcement. \n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they think the author is ruining their sister's life. But the parents are the ones who've been enabling the sister's behavior by not setting boundaries and giving in to her demands. The author might feel trapped between protecting themselves and their parents versus the family's reaction.\n\nMentally, the sister's refusal to seek help and her violent actions are significant factors. The author has a right to protect themselves from abuse and harm. The police are meant to handle such situations, so calling them isn't wrong. The parents' perspective might stem from cultural or familial pressures, but that doesn't negate the author's right to safety.\n\nI need to check if there are any legal nuances. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author reported it again, that's a justified action. The police's response would depend on the evidence and previous incidents. Since it's the second offense, the sister could face more severe consequences, which might be why the parents are upset. But the author isn't the one causing the problem; they're reporting it.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is taking a stand against abuse. The sister's behavior is harmful, and the author is trying to stop it. The parents' enablement is part of the issue, but the author can't be blamed for taking action to protect their safety. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're reporting a known abuser to protect themselves and their family. The answer should be B.\n"
