She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister who has been acting out with screaming, physical violence, and threatening family members. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, materialism, and now it's escalated. She yells at the author, hits the parents, destroys property, and even threatened to use knives. The author mentions she was already arrested once for domestic violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums. The author's actions were to call the police again because of the threats and fear for their safety. \n\nLegally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister's actions\u2014assault, threats, property damage\u2014are all criminal offenses. The author likely acted within their rights to protect their family. The parents' anger might stem from cultural factors or wanting to protect their child, but the sister's behavior is abusive and dangerous. \n\nThe author tried to get her help before, but she refused. The sister's refusal to seek help exacerbates the situation. The author's decision to involve law enforcement could be seen as necessary to prevent further harm. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like finding another support system or documenting incidents more thoroughly. But given the severity\u2014threats with knives, previous arrest\u2014it seems reasonable to involve the police. \n\nAlso, the parents' enabling by giving in to tantrums is problematic. The author might be trying to break that cycle. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is trying to protect themselves and their parents from abuse. The sister's actions are the main issue here. So, the author is not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
