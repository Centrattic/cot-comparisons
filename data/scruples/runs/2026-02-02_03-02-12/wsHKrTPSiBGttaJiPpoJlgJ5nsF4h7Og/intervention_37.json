She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissism, materialism, and escalating behavior, including yelling, physical assault, and threatening to attack with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author's actions led to a second arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if there's a threat of violence or actual physical harm, calling the police is appropriate. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, so this is a repeat offense. The author mentions fearing for their safety and their parents', which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to protect their family from a dangerous situation. The parents might be upset because they see it as ruining their daughter's life, but their daughter's actions are harmful. The sister refuses help, which complicates things. The author's decision to act could be seen as necessary to ensure safety, even if it causes family conflict. \n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that the author could have handled it differently, like seeking more family counseling first. But given the sister's history and refusal to engage with professionals, the situation seems to be escalating to a crisis point. The parents' enabling might also be a factor, but the author's responsibility is to their own well-being and their parents' as well. \n\nSo, considering both legal and moral perspectives, the author's actions seem justified. They're acting to prevent further harm, which is a priority. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
