She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister's abusive behavior, and the author called the police on her for the second time. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has been physically attacking the parents. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author is frustrated because they fear for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: calling the police after the sister's multiple offenses. The sister has a history of domestic violence, including physical assault and threats with knives. The author mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence and this is the second offense. So, the author is taking action after trying to address the issue through other means, like suggesting professional help, which the sister refused. \n\nThe parents are upset because they believe the author ruined their daughter's life. But the author's priority is the safety of the family. The sister's behavior is escalating and has led to a dangerous environment where even basic things like keeping knives are avoided. The author's decision to involve the police could be seen as necessary to prevent further harm. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, reporting domestic violence is not only a right but a responsibility, especially when there's a history of abuse and threats. The parents might not be in a position to enforce boundaries, so the author stepping in could be justified. \n\nHowever, the question of whether the author is in the wrong might depend on context. If there's a possibility of resolving the issue without involving police, like through legal means or more intensive counseling, but that's not the case here because the sister has refused help. The author's action is a response to immediate threats and repeated offenses. \n\nSo, considering the sister's dangerous behavior and the author's intent to protect the family, it's more likely that the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
