She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior: she's described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming, threatening with knives, and physically attacking family members. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence. The author called the police again because they feared for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nNow, considering the legal and safety aspects. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and if someone is threatening with weapons and there's a history of physical assault, it's reasonable to involve law enforcement. The author mentions that their parents are working class and have already supported the sister's expensive education. The sister refuses help, which adds to the problem.\n\nBut the parents are upset that the author \"ruined her life.\" However, the author's main concern is safety. In legal terms, if someone is in imminent danger, reporting the abuse is a responsible action. The sister's prior arrest indicates that this isn't the first time, so the situation might be escalating. The author isn't just being difficult; they're acting to ensure their family's safety.\n\nI should also consider if there's any overreaction. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are the repeated threats, physical violence, and refusal to seek help. Calling the police in such circumstances is a valid step to protect oneself and others. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
