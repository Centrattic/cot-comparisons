She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have gotten worse after studying abroad. She throws tantrums, yells at the family, and even physically assaults them. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which is causing the author to take drastic action by calling the police a second time, leading to the sister's arrest. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from a legal and moral standpoint. The sister's behavior includes physical assault and threats with knives, which are serious crimes. The author mentions fearing for their safety and their parents' well-being. Calling the police in such cases is a legitimate action to ensure safety. The sister has a history of domestic violence and has been arrested before, which suggests a pattern of dangerous behavior.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the author is not in the wrong for reporting a crime, especially when it's a matter of public safety. The police are meant to intervene in domestic violence situations. The fact that the sister refused help and the parents kept enabling her adds to the justification for the author's actions. The parents might feel conflicted because they want to protect their child, but safety should be the priority.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, family issues are handled internally, and involving authorities might be seen as shaming. But the author's well-being and safety are critical. The sister's threats with knives make the situation urgent. The author's actions are a last resort after other attempts failed.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they acted to protect themselves and their family from ongoing abuse and threats. The sister's actions are criminal, and calling the police is a responsible step. The parents' anger is a separate issue, but the author's intent was to ensure safety, which is justified.\n"
