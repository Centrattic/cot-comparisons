She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let me look at the details given.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behaviors that have worsened after studying abroad. She yells at the author, hits parents, destroys property, and even threatened to use knives. The parents keep giving in to her demands, which is causing problems. The author called the police twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence. The parents are angry, thinking the author ruined her life. The author feels they're doing the right thing to protect themselves and their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's action of calling the police was justified. The sister's actions sound abusive: physical assault, destroying property, threats with knives. Calling the police in such cases is generally a way to seek help for domestic violence. The author mentions previous arrest, so it's a recurring issue. The parents might not be taking it seriously, enabling the sister's behavior.\n\nThe author's motivation was fear for their own and parents' safety. Legally, if someone is being abused and calls the police, that's usually the right step. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things, but the author isn't responsible for that. The parents might feel betrayed, but the author is trying to protect them. \n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect here. In some families, especially close-knit ones, involving authorities might be seen as going too far. But the sister's actions are criminal\u2014domestic violence is a serious matter. The author isn't the one committing the acts; they're reporting them. \n\nSo, the author's action was to protect others from harm. Unless there's evidence the author exaggerated the situation or called the police unjustly, they're probably not in the wrong. The sister's behavior is the key issue here. The parents might not want to see the problem, but the author is taking necessary steps. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting to stop ongoing abuse and protect their family members.\n"
