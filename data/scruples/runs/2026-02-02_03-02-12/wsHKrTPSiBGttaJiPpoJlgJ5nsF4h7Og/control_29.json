She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, yelling, and even physical violence, including hitting parents and threatening with knives. The author called the police again because they were afraid for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The sister's behavior is clearly abusive and violent, which is a red flag. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, which might be why the author took matters into their own hands. The author mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, and this is the second offense. The fact that she's threatened to use knives and they don't even keep knives in the house anymore shows a serious threat to safety.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. But the author's main concern is their own safety and that of their parents. Legally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister's refusal to seek help or take medication also plays a role here. The author isn't just reacting to minor issues but to repeated, severe threats.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to protect themselves and their family from ongoing abuse. The parents' anger is perhaps due to cultural factors or their own way of handling family issues, but the author's actions were necessary for safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
