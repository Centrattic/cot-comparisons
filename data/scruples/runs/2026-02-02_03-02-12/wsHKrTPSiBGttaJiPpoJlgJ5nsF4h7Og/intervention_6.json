She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister has been acting really badly. She's narcissistic, materialistic, throws tantrums, screams a lot, and even physically attacks her parents and destroys property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author is tired of it. They called the police a second time, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence. Now, the parents are upset with the author, thinking they ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the sister's actions. Physical assault on family members and destruction of property are serious offenses. Domestic violence is a criminal act, and being arrested for it is a legal consequence. The sister had a prior arrest, which makes this a second offense. The author mentions that the sister even threatened to attack with knives, so there's a history of violence and threats. The author's fear for their safety and their parents' safety seems justified here.\n\nThe parents' reaction is that the author ruined their daughter's life. But from the description, the sister's behavior is abusive and dangerous. By calling the police, the author is trying to stop ongoing abuse and protect their family. That seems like a responsible action. The parents are enabling the sister by not holding her accountable, which allows the sister to continue her harmful behavior. The author is taking a stand against the abuse, which is the right thing to do, even if it causes family tension.\n\nThe sister refuses help and sees the family as the problem. The author and parents have tried to get her help but she won't accept it. So, the author is acting in self-defense and to protect their parents from further harm. Legal actions are necessary when there's a threat of violence. The author isn't the asshole here; they're the victim trying to end the abuse. The parents' anger is misplaced because they're prioritizing their daughter's well-being over the safety of the entire family. The author's actions are justified.\n"
