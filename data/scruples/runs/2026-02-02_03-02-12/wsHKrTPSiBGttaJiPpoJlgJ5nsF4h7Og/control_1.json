She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She's aggressive, yells a lot, and even physically assaults her parents. The author felt compelled to call the police a second time because of the threats and past arrests.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. If the sister is indeed engaging in domestic violence, including physical assault and threats with weapons, then calling the police is a legitimate action to ensure safety. The author mentions she was already arrested once before, so this is a repeat offense. The parents are enabling her behavior by giving in to her demands, which might be contributing to the cycle.\n\nThe parents' anger towards the author is because they believe the author ruined their daughter's life, but from the author's perspective, they're trying to protect themselves and their parents. The sister refuses help, which complicates things. Legally, if there's a history of abuse and threats, contacting law enforcement is justified. The key here is whether the sister's actions meet the criteria for domestic violence, which they seem to based on the description. The author isn't just overreacting; they have valid reasons to fear for their safety.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect themselves and their family from a dangerous situation.\n"
