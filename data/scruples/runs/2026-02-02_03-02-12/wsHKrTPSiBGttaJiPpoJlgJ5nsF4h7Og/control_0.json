She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's gotten worse after studying abroad. She yells a lot, is physically aggressive, even hitting parents and destroying property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and they're upset with the author for calling the police. The author did this out of fear for their safety and their parents', especially since the sister has a history of domestic violence and even threatened to attack with knives. They mention this isn't the first time she was arrested.\n\nNow, the key points here are the sister's violent behavior, the author's actions to protect themselves and their parents, and the parents' resentment towards the author. Legally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is appropriate. The sister has a history of violence, so the author might be justified in seeking legal intervention. However, family dynamics can be complex. The parents might feel that the author is causing harm to their child by calling the police again, especially if they see the sister's actions as temporary or not as severe. But from a safety perspective, the author's actions seem necessary to prevent further harm.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The sister's mental health issues and refusal to seek help. The author's intent is to protect everyone, but the parents might feel it's a family matter. However, physical abuse is a criminal issue, and the law is there to prevent it. So, the author might not be in the wrong here because they're taking steps to ensure safety. On the other hand, if there were other options available (like more therapy, legal intervention without police) that weren't explored, maybe there's a different perspective. But given the information, the author seems to have tried getting help before, and the sister refused. So, calling the police again is a reasonable step.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect themselves and their parents from a violent family member, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement. Parents might be upset, but safety should take precedence. The sister's actions are criminal, and the author isn't the problem for seeking help.\n"
