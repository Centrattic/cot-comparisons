She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, yelling, physically assaulting the parents, and even threatening to attack with knives. The parents are working class and funded her education, but she's been a problem even after returning from university.\n\nThe author called the police a second time because they were afraid for their safety and their parents' well-being. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. The sister refuses help and blames the family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. I need to consider the facts: the sister's actions are violent and threatening, the author reports it to protect their family, and the sister is unresponsive to help. Legally, calling the police when someone's safety is at risk is usually the right move. The parents might not want to take action, but the author has a responsibility to themselves and their parents. The sister's behavior is escalating, and the author is acting to prevent further harm. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried more to resolve it within the family first? But given the sister's history and refusal to help, that might not work. Also, the police were called once before, so this is a repeat offense. The author has a valid reason to fear for safety. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
