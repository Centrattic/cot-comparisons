She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me look at the details provided.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that has worsened after returning from university. She yells, demands things, and even threatens family members. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her outbursts. The author mentions that the sister has a history of domestic violence, including physical assault and property damage. There's a prior arrest for domestic violence, and the author called the police again for a second time. The family is now without knives due to threats. The parents are upset with the author for \"ruining\" the sister's life. The author worked hard to get a scholarship to avoid burdening their parents, while the sister's lifestyle is funded by them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author acted wrongly. The sister's actions are clearly abusive and dangerous. The author called the police to protect their parents and themselves from harm. The police were already involved once before, which indicates a pattern of behavior. The author's actions seem to be in self-defense and to protect others. Even though the parents might be upset, the author's decision to involve law enforcement in a situation involving domestic violence and threats is a responsible action. The parents enabling the sister's behavior isn't the author's fault. The author isn't the one committing violence; they're seeking help to stop it. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Did the author have other options? They tried to get the sister to seek help, which she refused. The threat of knives and previous arrests justify the emergency. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
