She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation described is pretty intense. The sister is being physically violent, threatening with knives, and destroying property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands after her tantrums. The author's sister has a history of domestic violence, including an arrest, and now the author called the police again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is threatening or physically harming family members, especially with weapons, that's a criminal matter. Calling the police in such cases is typically the right thing to do to ensure safety. The author mentions fearing for their and their parents' well-being, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their sister's life. But from the author's perspective, it's about protecting themselves and their family from ongoing abuse. The sister has refused help, like seeing professionals, which might indicate a pattern of harmful behavior that isn't improving.\n\nThe sister's actions\u2014threats with knives, physical assault\u2014clearly cross legal and safety boundaries. The author's decision to call the police a second time might be seen as necessary to prevent further harm. Parents might prefer to avoid legal trouble for their child, but their well-being and safety should take precedence.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is acting to protect their family from a dangerous situation. While it's tough to confront family in this way, the priority here is safety. The fact that the sister has a history of violence and hasn't sought help despite being offered support adds to the justification of the author's actions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a stand against abuse and seeking help through proper channels. The answer should be B (No).\n"
