She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, threatens with knives, has a history of domestic violence, and physically assaults family members. The author called the police a second time because they feared for their safety and their parents' well-being. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author has a legitimate fear for their safety, calling the police when there's an immediate threat might be justified. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, which is a serious offense. The author mentions she threatened to attack with knives and they no longer keep knives in the house, which shows a real fear of violence.\n\nNext, the parents are upset, but their leniency towards the sister's behavior has allowed the situation to escalate. The author's actions were to protect themselves and their parents from harm. The sister's refusal to seek help and her continued aggressive behavior suggest that the author felt they had no other recourse to ensure safety.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The parents might feel that the author overstepped by involving law enforcement. However, given the sister's past offenses and the threats made, the author's actions could be seen as necessary for safety. The key points here are the prior arrests, the immediate threat, and the refusal to address mental health issues, which all support the author's decision as a last resort.\n\nIn determining if the author is in the wrong, the main factors are self-protection and the legal duty to report domestic violence. Since the sister's actions are criminal and the author is taking steps to prevent further harm, it's likely they're not in the wrong. The parents' anger is understandable but doesn't negate the author's right to seek protection through legal means.\n"
