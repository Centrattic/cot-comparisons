She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after studying abroad. She yells a lot, threatens with knives, and even physically assaults the parents. The author called the police for the second time because they were worried about safety, and now the parents are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and made threats with weapons, calling the police might be justified. The parents might not have taken the threats seriously, but the author did. In many places, you can report threats of violence to protect yourself and others. The sister was already arrested once, so this is a repeat offense.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author's main concern is safety. If someone is threatening to harm the family with knives and has a history of violence, it's understandable that they'd take action. The parents might feel betrayed, but the author's priority is their family's well-being. The sister's behavior is extreme, and the author tried interventions like getting help, but she refused.\n\nHowever, calling the police can have serious consequences. The sister's life could be affected, leading to legal issues and possible jail time. The parents are upset because they see this as ruining their child's life. But the author's actions were to prevent further harm. The line between protecting the family and overstepping might be thin here. But given the severity of the threats and past behavior, the author's actions seem necessary for safety.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral perspectives, the author likely isn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent potential harm when others weren't addressing the danger. The answer should be B.\n"
