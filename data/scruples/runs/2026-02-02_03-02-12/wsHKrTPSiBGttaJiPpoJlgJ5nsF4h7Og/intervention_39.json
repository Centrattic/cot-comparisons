She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister for violent and abusive behavior. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of physical violence towards the parents and property. The parents keep giving in to her demands, and the author is frustrated because they have to work hard to avoid debt. The sister has already been arrested once before for domestic violence, and this is the second time the author called the police.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the sister's abusive behavior, the threat to the family's safety, and the fact that the parents refuse to take a stand. The author mentions that the sister has physically attacked them and destroyed property, which is a serious issue. The sister also made threats about using knives, leading the family to not keep any knives in the house. This seems like a legitimate safety concern.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, calling the police to report someone for domestic violence or threatening behavior is a responsible action, especially when there's a history of such incidents. The author has a right to protect themselves and their family from potential harm. The fact that the sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence adds weight to the seriousness of the situation. The family's well-being and safety should be a priority, and the author's actions were aimed at addressing that.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life, but from the author's perspective, it's about survival and safety. The sister refuses to seek help, making the situation even more dire. The author isn't just making a minor complaint; they're taking a stand against violence and abuse in their home. It's important to consider that in such cases, law enforcement is meant to be called when there's a threat to personal safety. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that there could be other ways to handle the situation, like involving social services or community support, but given the severity of the sister's actions\u2014physical assault, destruction of property, threats with weapons\u2014calling the police is a reasonable step. The author isn't exaggerating the situation; they're responding to real threats. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author called the police without cause. The repeated incidents and the sister's refusal to seek help justify the action. The parents' reaction is understandable but maybe not in line with the actual danger their daughter poses. The author's responsibility here is to ensure their own safety and that of the parents, so by calling the police, they're protecting the family from further harm.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Their actions were necessary to address a dangerous situation. The answer should be B.\n"
