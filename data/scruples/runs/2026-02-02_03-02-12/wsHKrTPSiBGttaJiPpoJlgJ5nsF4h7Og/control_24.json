She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic tendencies, leading to physical and verbal abuse towards the family. The key points here are the sister's repeated violent behavior, the parents enabling her, and the author's actions to protect themselves and their family.\n\nFirst, the sister's actions include screaming, physical assault, and destruction of property. She's been arrested once before for domestic violence, and there's a threat involving knives. The parents are working-class and have given in to her demands despite the financial strain. The author, feeling unsafe, called the police again after the sister's second offense. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nLegally, calling the police when someone is threatening or committing violence is justified. Self-defense and the safety of others are valid reasons. The sister's refusal to seek help and the author's fear for their family's well-being support the action. The parents' anger might be due to their attachment or enabling behavior, but the author's responsibility is to protect themselves.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author could have tried other methods first, but given the sister's history and refusal to help, calling the police is a reasonable step. The author isn't the aggressor here; they're reacting to abuse. Also, the sister's actions are criminal, so reporting them isn't wrong. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
