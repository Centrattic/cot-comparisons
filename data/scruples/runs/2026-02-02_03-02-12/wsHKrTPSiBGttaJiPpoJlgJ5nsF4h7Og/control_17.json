She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense. The sister's behavior has escalated to physical threats and assaults, and the parents aren't doing anything to stop it. The author called the police because they were afraid for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and is threatening with knives, then the author acting to protect themselves and their family might be justified. The police are supposed to handle such situations, so calling them in a case of domestic violence is probably the right move. \n\nBut then there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. They might be in denial about the sister's behavior or feel guilty. The sister is refusing help, which complicates things. \n\nHowever, the key points here are the threats and physical assaults. If someone is threatening to attack with a weapon and has a history of violence, then calling the police is a responsible action. The author isn't just being a tattletale; they're trying to prevent harm. \n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to seek help and the parents' inability to set boundaries contribute to the problem. The author's actions might be necessary self-defense. So, the answer would be B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
