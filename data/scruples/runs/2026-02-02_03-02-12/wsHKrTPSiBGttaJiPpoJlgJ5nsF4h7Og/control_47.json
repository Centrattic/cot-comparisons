She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is the asshole. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic tendencies, who has a history of physical abuse towards the parents and property destruction. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands after her tantrums. The author called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence, which has caused the parents to be angry with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and reporting it is not only a legal right but also a moral duty to protect oneself and others. The sister's actions\u2014physical assault, threats with knives, and destroying property\u2014are clear indicators of abuse. The author's fear for their safety and their parents' well-being is justified.\n\nThe parents' reaction that the author \"ruined her life\" suggests a prioritization of family loyalty over safety, which can be a common issue in some cultures or family dynamics. However, the author isn't the one committing crimes; they're seeking help to stop an abuser. The sister's refusal to seek help or acknowledge the problem exacerbates the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent to protect themselves and their family from harm. Calling the police in response to domestic violence is a responsible action, not a wrong one. The parents' anger might stem from cultural expectations or fear of social stigma, but that doesn't make the author at fault. The sister's behavior is the core issue here.\n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, were there prior attempts to resolve the issue non-legally? Yes, they tried to get her help, which she refused. The author's actions were a last resort after those efforts failed. There's no indication of false reporting or malicious intent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
