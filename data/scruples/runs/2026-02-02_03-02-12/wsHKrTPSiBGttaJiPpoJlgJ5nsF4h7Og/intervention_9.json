She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, yelling, and even physical abuse towards the parents. The author mentions that the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and the parents are upset because the author \"ruined her life.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister is physically assaulting family members and threatening them with knives, calling the police would be a legitimate action. Law enforcement's role is to protect individuals from harm, so reporting ongoing abuse is a responsible step. The author's actions might be justified under domestic violence laws.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is complex. The parents are upset because they might prioritize family over legal consequences, possibly due to cultural factors or fear of further conflict. However, the author's concern for their own safety and that of their parents is valid. When someone threatens with weapons and has a history of violence, self-preservation is key.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help complicates things. The family tried to get her help before, but she refused. This inaction from her side might mean that the author's intervention was necessary. The author isn't just reacting to a one-time incident but to a pattern of dangerous behavior that has escalated.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The parents might feel the author is overstepping, especially if they don't want to involve the legal system. But given the severity of the sister's actions\u2014physical assault, destruction of property, and threats\u2014the police involvement isn't an overreaction. The author is prioritizing safety over familial relationships, which is a tough but necessary choice in such circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions seem justified. They were protecting themselves and their family from an abusive situation. The sister's behavior meets legal definitions of domestic violence, and the author's response aligns with seeking legal help to stop the abuse. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
