She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has a 21-year-old sister who's been acting out, especially after returning from university. She's described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a temper. The sister yells a lot, throws tantrums, and even physically assaults the parents. The parents don't stand up to her, which is causing a lot of stress. The author worked hard to get a full ride to college, while the sister's lifestyle is funded by their working-class parents. The sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and was arrested again by the author. Now the parents are angry because the author \"ruined her life,\" but the author is concerned about their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If someone is in immediate danger and someone calls the police, that's usually a good idea. The sister's threats with knives and previous arrest for domestic violence suggest there's a credible threat. The author mentions fearing for their safety, which is a strong reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nThen, the parents' reaction. They are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life. But the parents also enabled the sister by giving in to her tantrums and not protecting themselves or the author. The sister has refused help, so the author might feel like they have no other options left.\n\nIs there a duty to protect oneself and family? In many cases, yes. If someone is in danger, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister's behavior is escalating, and she's already been arrested once. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to prevent further harm.\n\nBut there's also family dynamics to consider. The parents might feel the author should have tried other solutions first, like more counseling or intervention. However, the sister refused help, so there's a limit to what can be done. The author's frustration is understandable given the parents' lack of support.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted to protect themselves and their parents from a known threat. While it's a tough decision, their actions were likely justified. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
