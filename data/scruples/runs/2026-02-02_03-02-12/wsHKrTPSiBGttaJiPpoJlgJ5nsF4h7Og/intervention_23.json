She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, yelling, and even physical assaults. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums. The author mentions that the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and threatened to use knives, so the author called the police again. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and there are threats involving weapons, calling the police is a responsible action to protect oneself and family. The police are there to handle such situations, so the author is taking a legitimate step to ensure safety. \n\nThen, there's the family dynamics. The parents aren't protecting the author from the sister's behavior; instead, they're enabling her by not setting boundaries. The author's actions might be necessary to prevent further harm. The sister's refusal to seek help or change her behavior is a red flag. The author is trying to protect their family from ongoing abuse, which is a valid reason to involve authorities. \n\nAlso, the sister's past arrest and current threats indicate that this isn't a one-time incident. The author's fear for their own and parents' well-being is justified. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or personal beliefs about family reputation, but the author's safety is paramount. \n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The sister's age is 21, so she's an adult. The police should handle adult domestic violence cases, so the author isn't overstepping by reporting her. The fact that the sister is hitting the parents and destroying property is a clear sign of abuse. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in self-defense and protecting their family from a known abuser. The parents' enabling behavior is part of the problem, but the author's response is appropriate given the circumstances.\n"
