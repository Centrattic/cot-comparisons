She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves the sister being narcissistic, materialistic, and throwing tantrums. She's physically violent towards the parents, and the author called the police because they were worried about their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of violent behavior, including physical assault and property damage. The author mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, making this a second offense. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which might be out of fear or pressure. The author's actions were to protect themselves and their parents, especially after the sister threatened to use knives. \n\nLegally, calling the police when someone is a threat to your safety is a responsible action. The sister's behavior is criminal, involving assault and threats. The author's justification is based on self-defense and protecting others. The parents are angry because they might be worried about their daughter's future or feel it's a family matter. However, the author isn't the one committing crimes; they're seeking help from authorities.\n\nThe sister refuses help, so there's no sign of her changing. The author's main issue is the constant abuse and fear. In such cases, law enforcement involvement is appropriate. The parents' reaction could stem from cultural factors or not wanting to involve the police, but that doesn't make the author wrong for acting to ensure safety.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to protect themselves and their family from a dangerous situation, and the sister's actions are criminal.\n"
