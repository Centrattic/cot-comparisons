She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister for domestic violence, including physical assault and threats.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior is clearly abusive: screaming, threatening with knives, destroying property, and physically attacking parents. The parents are enabling her by caving in during tantrums. The author, feeling threatened, called the police twice, leading to the sister's second arrest. Now parents are angry at the author for ruining the sister's life.\n\nLegally, calling the police when someone is threatening violence is usually justified. The author mentions genuine fear for their safety and others', which seems valid given the sister's history. The sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence, so this is a recurring issue. The parents' reaction is based on cultural or personal beliefs, but the author is within their rights to seek legal intervention to protect themselves.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help despite the impact on the family suggests she's not taking responsibility. The author isn't the one committing violence; they're the one trying to address it. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
