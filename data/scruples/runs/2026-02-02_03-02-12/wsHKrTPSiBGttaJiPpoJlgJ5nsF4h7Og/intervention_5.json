She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic traits, who has become more aggressive after returning from university. She yells a lot, and even physically attacks her parents. The author mentions a previous arrest for domestic violence and that they feared for their safety again, leading them to call the police a second time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is in immediate danger or there's a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a reasonable action. The author's sister has a history of violent behavior, including threats with knives and actual physical assault. This could be considered a valid reason to involve law enforcement to protect themselves and their family.\n\nNext, the parents' reaction is important. They feel the author ruined their daughter's life, but the author is trying to protect their own well-being. The parents might be in denial or in a state of enabling their daughter's behavior, which the author is trying to stop. The parents' refusal to take a stand against their daughter's actions could mean they don't realize the severity of the situation, making the author's intervention necessary.\n\nThen there's the psychological aspect. The sister's refusal to seek help and her hostile behavior towards the family suggest a pattern of abuse. The author is prioritizing safety over family dynamics, which is understandable given the circumstances. The sister's actions are not just about personality but involve criminal behavior (assault, threats), which law enforcement should address.\n\nHowever, I should also consider cultural or familial factors. In some cultures, involving the police on family members might be seen as extreme. But the author's primary concern is safety, and when there's a history of violence and threats, self-preservation takes precedence over family loyalty.\n\nPotential counterarguments might be that the author didn't try all possible non-violent solutions first. But they did mention attempts to get their sister help, which she refused. Calling the police is a step taken after those efforts failed and the situation escalated. The author's decision to act is a last resort to prevent further harm.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions seem justified based on the threat to safety and the sister's criminal history. The key points are the physical violence, threats, and the author's genuine fear for their life and their parents'. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
