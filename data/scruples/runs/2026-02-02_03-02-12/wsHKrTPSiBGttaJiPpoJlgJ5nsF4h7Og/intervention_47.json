She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic behavior that's escalated since returning from university. She yells a lot, is violent towards the parents, and the author called the police on her for domestic violence a second time. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined her life, and the sister refuses help.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points here are the sister's violent behavior. If the sister physically assaults the parents and threatens with knives, that's domestic violence, which is a criminal offense. Calling the police in such cases is generally a responsible action to ensure safety. The author mentions that the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, so this is a second offense. The author likely felt justified in protecting their family from further harm.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life, but that's their perspective. The author's actions were to prevent ongoing abuse and protect their family. The sister's refusal to seek help and her violent behavior make her the aggressor here. The author working hard for a full ride to college while the sister's lifestyle is funded by the parents adds context but isn't directly relevant to the legal action taken.\n\nSo, the author acted to prevent harm, which is a valid reason to call the police. The sister's actions are the problematic ones. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
