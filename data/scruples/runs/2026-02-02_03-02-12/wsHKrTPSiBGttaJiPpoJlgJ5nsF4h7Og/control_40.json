She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe sister is 21, returned from university, and has become increasingly narcissistic and materialistic. She yells a lot, even at small things like someone leaving their room. The parents won't set boundaries, so the sister can get away with anything. She's even physically violent, hitting parents and damaging property. There's a history of domestic violence; she was arrested before and this is a second offense. The author called the police again because they fear for their safety, especially since the sister has threatened to use knives.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. The sister refuses help and says the family is the problem. The author feels they need to get her out of their lives.\n\nNow, considering these points: the sister's actions are clearly abusive and dangerous. Physical assault and threats with weapons are criminal. The author acted to protect themselves and their parents, which is understandable. The parents enabling the sister's behavior by giving in to her tantrums isn't helping. The author's actions were in self-defense and to prevent further harm. The sister's refusal to seek help adds to the problem. Legally, calling the police in a situation of domestic violence is usually the right move. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
