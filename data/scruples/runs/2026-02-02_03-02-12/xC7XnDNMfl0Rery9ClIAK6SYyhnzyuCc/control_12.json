She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, leaving the husband to take over all the chores and cooking. The kids are picky eaters, and the husband feels he can't handle it as well as the wife, so he asks her to prep dinners for the week. She gets upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests he can just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is taking time away from the kids for the first time since they were born, which is a big deal. The husband is taking on a lot of responsibilities during her absence. He's asking for help because he's concerned about the kids' reactions to different food. But the wife is upset because she feels it's too much to ask. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are about reasonable expectations and communication. The husband's request is to make things easier for himself, but the wife might feel that she's already being asked to do extra work when she's going on a trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself, or she doesn't feel it's fair to add more to her plate before she leaves. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reasoning is that since the wife knows the kids' preferences better, asking her to prep might be logical. But it's important to consider if this request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and might interfere with her trip preparations. If she's already busy, adding that task could be overwhelming. \n\nAlso, the husband's alternative of making sandwiches seems dismissive of her feelings. Saying \"if it gets too hard you can just make sandwiches\" might not acknowledge her effort or the real needs of the kids. Maybe the wife feels undervalued or that her work isn't being respected. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about balancing needs and expectations. The husband is trying to manage his own stress, but the wife's reaction suggests that the request is crossing a line for her. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her perspective or the additional burden it might place on her before her trip. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the request was reasonable. If the wife feels it's too much, even if the husband thinks it's necessary, then maybe he didn't account for her feelings. The husband might be in the wrong if he didn't communicate better or if the request is indeed too much. But if the request is a reasonable way to distribute responsibilities, then maybe not. However, given that the wife is going on a trip and might be preparing for it, adding meal prep could be seen as an unfair extra task. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his wife's feelings and the additional burden of prepping meals before her trip, which she found too much. His alternative suggestion might also be dismissive of her effort. The key issue here is the communication and consideration of her perspective, which seems lacking.\n"
