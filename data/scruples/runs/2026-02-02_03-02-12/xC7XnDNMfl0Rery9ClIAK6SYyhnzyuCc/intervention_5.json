It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to prep meals for the week because he's not confident in his cooking skills with picky kids. She gets upset and refuses, suggesting he make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The husband's reasoning is practical. He's taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's not as experienced with. Meal prepping would make things easier for him. He's asking her to do something that would help him manage the week better. The wife, on the other hand, feels it's too much work to ask her to do the meal prep. She might be stressed about the trip itself or the additional responsibility before leaving.\n\nIs the husband being reasonable? Well, he's not asking her to do something during the trip; he's asking her to prep before she leaves. It's a common practice for people to prep meals before a trip. The key point is whether the request is reasonable. Since she's the one who normally cooks and knows the kids' preferences, prepping meals before her trip makes sense. However, she might feel overwhelmed or see it as adding to her workload before a trip. Maybe she's already busy with packing or other preparations.\n\nBut the husband is in a challenging situation with the kids for a week. If the kids are picky, and he's not used to cooking for them, meal prepping could prevent meltdowns and stress. So his request is coming from a place of wanting to manage the situation better.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could have discussed alternatives. For example, she could prep a few meals instead of all, or they could freeze some meals. But the wife's refusal to prep and suggesting sandwiches might indicate that she feels the request is unreasonable. However, the sandwiches solution might not be satisfying for the kids, leading to more problems.\n\nThe husband's argument is that since she's leaving, it's fair to ask her to prep. The wife might feel that once she's away, it's his responsibility. But since she's still around before the trip, asking her to help isn't unreasonable. Also, considering the first time he's handling everything alone, the preparation would be a helpful support.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't asking her to do something during the trip. He's asking her to prepare in advance. It's a common practice. The wife's reaction might be due to stress about the trip or feeling overburdened. However, the husband's request is practical and aimed at easing his burden. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress, but the husband's reasoning is valid.\n"
