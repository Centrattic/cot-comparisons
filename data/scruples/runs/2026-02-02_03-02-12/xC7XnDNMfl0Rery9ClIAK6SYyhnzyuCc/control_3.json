It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the week because he's worried about cooking for the kids, who are picky. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's main concern is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, and their preferences are known better by the wife. He wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids if they don't get their usual food. The wife is taking a trip, which is their first time apart since the kids were born, so maybe she's also stressed about leaving. She might feel that meal prepping is an extra burden when she's already preparing for her trip.\n\nIs there a cultural or social norm here? In some relationships, splitting chores equally is expected, but here the wife already handles cooking. The husband is asking for help because he's stepping into her role temporarily. Is it reasonable to ask her to do some prep work before leaving? The wife might feel like she's already doing her part by handling the cooking normally, and adding meal prepping could be seen as extra work beyond her usual responsibilities. \n\nAnother angle: The husband is trying to make the transition easier for himself, but maybe he should have considered other solutions. For example, could they adjust the meal plan during the week, maybe include more kid-friendly options that are easier to make? Or maybe they could freeze some meals beforehand. The problem is that the husband is relying on the wife to do all the prep, which she might not have time or energy for, especially if she's already busy with her trip preparations.\n\nAlso, the wife's response that \"if it gets too hard you can just make sandwiches\" seems dismissive of his concerns. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The husband might feel that his request is reasonable, but the wife might feel that he's not considering her workload. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The husband is asking for help, which is a common thing in relationships. However, if the wife is already handling the cooking and the husband isn't used to it, maybe he should have taken the initiative to learn or adjust rather than expecting her to do more work before her trip. On the other hand, the wife might not have had enough time to prep, or maybe she's overwhelmed with her own plans. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to manage the household during her absence. However, he could have approached the situation differently, maybe by discussing alternatives or preparing some meals himself instead of relying solely on her. The wife's refusal might be valid if she's overburdened. But since the question is about the author's fault, the answer might hinge on whether the request was reasonable. \n\nIn most cases, asking a partner to do something extra before leaving, especially if it's a reasonable request, isn't necessarily wrong. But if the wife is already stretched thin, maybe the husband should have considered that. But given the info, the husband's main point is to avoid kid meltdowns, which is a valid concern. The wife's reaction seems a bit dismissive, so the husband's request isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's trying to manage the situation and asking for help. The wife's response is the issue here, not the request itself.\n"
