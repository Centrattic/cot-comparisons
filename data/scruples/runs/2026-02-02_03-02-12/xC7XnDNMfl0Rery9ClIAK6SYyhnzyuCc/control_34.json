It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to prepare meals for the week she's away, so he can handle the kids and chores alone. The wife is upset and refuses, saying it's too much work and suggests he can make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each side. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, who are picky. He wants consistency to avoid meltdowns. The wife is taking a week off, so he's asking her to prep meals in advance. But she's taking it as an extra burden. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals before her trip? Well, she's going away, so the prep would have to be done before she leaves. If she's the one who knows the kids' preferences better, maybe it's logical to have her do the prep. But the wife might feel that since she's not present during the week, it's not her responsibility anymore. Also, prepping for a whole week might be a lot of work, especially if she's already busy with her own trip preparations.\n\nOn the flip side, the husband is taking on a huge responsibility with the kids and chores. It's understandable he wants some help even if she's away. But maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps the husband could have asked for a smaller amount of prep, like some pre-cooked meals or ingredients prepped, rather than all dinners. The wife's reaction might be because she feels overwhelmed by the request, especially if she's already stressed about the trip.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If he's only asking for something reasonable and within her capacity, maybe not. But if he's not considering her perspective and the effort required, maybe he is. The key points are whether the request is reasonable and how it's communicated. The wife might feel that once she's gone, the responsibility is his, so prepping meals is adding to her workload right before the trip. The husband might not realize how much time and effort prepping for a week would take. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often judge based on fairness and mutual understanding. The husband's request might be seen as valid because he needs help, but the wife's refusal might be due to the request being too much. It's possible that the husband didn't consider the workload or communication. If he had offered to compensate or help with something else, maybe it would be different. But as it stands, asking her to prep all the meals might be more than she can handle, especially if it's unexpected. So maybe the husband is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the actual effort involved.\n"
