It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores alone for a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is that cooking is his wife's responsibility, and since she knows the kids' preferences better, meal prepping would make things easier for him. He's not asking her to do a lot of work, just prepping dinners for the week. However, the wife got upset because she thought it was too much work, and she offered an alternative of sandwiches.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author is asking for help to manage a challenging week. Since the wife is going away, it's reasonable to expect her to help in some way, especially if she's the primary cook. But maybe the request was too much, or maybe the way it was asked was an issue.\n\nThe wife's reaction might suggest that she felt the request was excessive or that she was being asked to do something beyond her capacity at the time. The author might not have considered that prepping meals for a week could be seen as a significant task, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Alternatively, the author might be justified in wanting to ensure the kids' meals are handled properly given their pickiness.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that cooking is solely the wife's responsibility. If they have a shared routine where the wife does most of the cooking, maybe the author should have taken more initiative or adjusted the meal plan in advance. However, the author does mention that he can do it, but prefers she preps because of her familiarity with the kids' preferences. That seems like a valid reason.\n\nCommunication could also be a factor. If the request was made in a way that made the wife feel burdened, maybe the author could have approached it differently. For example, discussing it earlier or offering to help with some prep.\n\nIn terms of fairness, asking someone to prepare meals before a trip can be seen as reasonable, especially if it's a one-time thing. But if the wife feels it's too much, especially if she's already stressed about the trip, that's valid too. The author might not be wrong in wanting the help, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective enough.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asking for help based on her strengths and the situation. However, there's a valid argument that he could have communicated better or considered the extra work for her. But the core need for assistance during her absence seems reasonable.\n"
