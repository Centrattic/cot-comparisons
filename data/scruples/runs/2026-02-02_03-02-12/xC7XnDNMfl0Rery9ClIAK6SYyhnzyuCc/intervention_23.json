It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife is going on a week-long trip, and he asked her to pre-make dinners for the week because he's worried about handling the kids' picky eating and his own work. The wife got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches instead. The author feels he's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is practical: he's taking over all his wife's chores, including cooking, which he's not as confident with. The kids are picky, and he's worried about meltdowns if the food isn't right. He's asking the wife to prep meals before she leaves, which would help him during the week. It seems like a reasonable request to make his situation manageable.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is taking her first trip away since the kids were born, so maybe she's stressed about leaving. The author is asking her to prep meals, which she finds too much work. She might feel that she's already sacrificing by being away from the kids and not want to add more to her pre-trip tasks. Maybe she's overwhelmed and doesn't have the energy to prepare a week's worth of meals, especially if it's time-consuming. Her suggestion of sandwiches is a simpler alternative, but the author wants more substantial meals.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness. The author is asking for help to manage something he's not used to handling. Since the wife is going to be away, it's reasonable to ask her to assist in setting things up before she leaves. However, if the prep work is too burdensome for her, especially if she's already preparing for a trip, maybe the author didn't consider her perspective. Did he consult with her and find a middle ground? For example, maybe she can prep some meals instead of all, or they could adjust the kids' menu for the week.\n\nBut the author's main point is that he's trying to avoid meltdowns and that he's not as skilled in cooking as she is. Since he's taking over her responsibilities, he's entitled to some support. The wife's refusal might be because she feels the request is excessive, but the author's request is for a specific, temporary help. It's a common issue in shared responsibilities where one partner is more experienced in certain domestic areas.\n\nI think the key here is whether the request is reasonable. Preparing meals for a week is a significant task, but considering that it's for her own children and to make her partner's week easier, it might be seen as a reasonable ask. However, the wife might feel that she's already giving up time with the kids, so adding more work before the trip is unfair. The author might not fully realize how much prep time is involved, and the wife might not have communicated her feelings about the workload.\n\nIn many relationships, partners expect some support, especially in shared responsibilities. The author is asking for temporary help to manage something he's not as confident in. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" seems dismissive and might not consider the author's concerns about the kids' preferences and potential meltdowns. However, if making sandwiches is a viable alternative that the author is willing to accept, maybe that's a compromise. The author's request isn't unreasonable, but maybe he could have been more flexible or discussed alternatives with his wife to find a solution that works for both.\n\nOverall, the author's intention is to manage the situation effectively, and he's not making a demand but a request. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or feeling overwhelmed. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance of their responsibilities and communication. Since the author is trying to set up for success during his wife's absence and the wife is not providing the support he asked for, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the prep work is too much for her, he could have offered to help in another way or adjusted expectations.\n"
