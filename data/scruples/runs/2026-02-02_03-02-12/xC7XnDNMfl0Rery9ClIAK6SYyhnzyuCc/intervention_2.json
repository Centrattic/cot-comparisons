It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about handling the kids and chores, especially cooking, since the wife usually does it and knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work. The user's opinion is that the husband isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is practical: he's taking on more responsibilities because the wife is away. He wants consistency for the kids, who are picky. Meal prepping could prevent meltdowns. The wife's reaction is that it's too much work and offers a compromise (sandwiches). But the husband feels it's reasonable to ask since she's going on the trip.\n\nIs the husband being selfish? Maybe. He's asking for something that might add stress before her trip. But he's also managing a lot alone. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week isn't unreasonable if it's feasible. However, the wife's refusal could be due to stress or her own workload. The husband might not have considered her perspective, like if she's already preparing for the trip and prepping meals adds extra stress. The argument about fairness is that since she's going, she should help, but maybe the trip is much needed and she deserves some time off. Alternatively, the husband could have offered to help with the meal prep or split the task.\n\nThe main issue is communication. Perhaps the husband didn't frame the request in a way that acknowledges her effort or offers support. The wife might feel like the burden is still on her even when she's away. But from the husband's side, he's trying to manage a challenging week. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The husband's intention is to make things easier, but the wife's reaction suggests she feels overburdened. The husband might not be in the wrong because the request is practical, but he could have handled it better. However, the wife's refusal is also valid if prepping meals is too much for her. The answer might depend on their usual dynamics. If this is a pattern where the wife always ends up doing the cooking, the husband might need to take more responsibility. But in this specific case, asking for prepped meals isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
