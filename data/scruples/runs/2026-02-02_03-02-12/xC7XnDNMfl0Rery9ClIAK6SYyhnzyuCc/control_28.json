It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores. He normally doesn't cook because the wife handles it, and the kids are picky. So he wants her to prep meals for the week. But she's upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm. First, the husband's reasoning is that since the wife knows the kids' preferences better, and he's not as experienced, meal prepping would make things easier. But the wife is taking a week off, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. The key points here are communication and mutual support.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals when she's about to leave? Well, if she's going away, maybe she's already busy packing and dealing with her own travel stuff. If he's asking her to do something extra that's a big task, and she feels it's too much, then maybe he should consider her perspective. He says he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food, but he's also asking her to take on more work right before her trip. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's refusal might be because she's overwhelmed. Maybe she's already stressed about being away from the kids and the added prep work is too much. The husband could be trying to be proactive, but perhaps he didn't consider her current capacity. They might need to discuss and find a middle ground, like prepping just a few meals instead of all, or adjusting expectations. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to manage the household, but he should have considered her feelings and workload. Maybe he should have asked earlier or found a less burdensome solution. The wife's reaction might be valid if she's already stressed. So the answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong, but needing better communication. Wait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife is the one who's upset and says it's too much, maybe the husband's request is reasonable but the execution could be better. However, the wife's refusal is her right. So is he in the wrong? Maybe not, because he's trying to plan. So answer B for No.\n"
