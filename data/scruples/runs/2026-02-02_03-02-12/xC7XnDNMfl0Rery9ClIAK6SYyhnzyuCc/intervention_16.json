It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the post) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The author is asking her to prep meals because he's responsible for cooking now, but he's worried about the kids' picky eating and not having the usual meals. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is taking on a significant responsibility by handling all the chores alone while the wife is away. He's not asking her to do something during the trip but before she leaves. Meal prepping is a common practice to ease the burden when someone is away. The wife's job is to make meals in advance so the husband doesn't have to manage it all during her absence.\n\nThe wife's reaction might be due to stress or feeling overwhelmed. Maybe she's already packing, planning her trip, and now this extra task adds to her load. However, the author's request is reasonable because he needs help, and the wife knows the kids' preferences better. The fact that she's the one who normally cooks means she's in the best position to prep the meals. The husband isn't making her do it during the trip; he's asking her to do it beforehand. \n\nIs there any unfairness? If the wife is already planning to leave, the request to prep meals before the trip is a way to support the husband. The wife might be right in feeling it's too much, but that's more about her capacity than the husband's request. The husband isn't forcing her; he's making a reasonable ask based on their usual roles. The wife's alternative (sandwiches) is a cop-out, showing she's not fully engaging with the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is not considering her workload. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking for help in a way that makes sense given their situation, he's not in the wrong. The wife's refusal is her own choice, but the husband's request is valid.\n"
