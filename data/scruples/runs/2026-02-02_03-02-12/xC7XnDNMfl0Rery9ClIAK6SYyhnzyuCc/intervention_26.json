It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling the cooking and chores alone, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying that's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's taking on a lot by managing everything alone, and asking for meal prep would make it easier. He's not asking for anything unreasonable, just to have the meals ready since she's more familiar with the kids' preferences. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work to her already busy schedule before her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or has other preparations to do, and meal prepping for a week is just too much for her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether the husband's request is fair. Is it reasonable to expect someone to meal prep for a week before a trip? Well, if they normally share responsibilities and the wife does most of the cooking, then asking her to handle that one time when she's going to be away could make sense. However, maybe the wife has a valid point if the request is excessive. The key here is whether the husband's request is within the bounds of their usual responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She got upset, which might indicate that the request is a burden. The husband's alternative of sandwiches is a good point because it shows he's trying to manage the situation, but he's concerned about the kids' reactions to different food. The question is whether the husband is overstepping by making the meal prep a necessity or if he's just trying to plan ahead.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband's intention is to make things easier for himself while managing the household alone. However, it's possible that the wife feels the request is unfair because she's already preparing to leave, and adding meal prep might be an unexpected or unreasonable ask. The husband might not have considered her stress levels before the trip. On the flip side, the husband's need for support is valid, especially since he's taking on more responsibilities.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the request is reasonable given their usual setup and the wife's ability to prepare, then he's not wrong. But if the request is adding undue stress on the wife when she's already preparing to leave, then maybe he's not considering her situation enough. The answer hinges on the balance between their shared responsibilities and the specific circumstances of the trip.\n"
