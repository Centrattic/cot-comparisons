It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores while she's away. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work, and the husband is confused because he thinks it's fair to ask.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help because he's taking on extra responsibilities. Cooking is usually the wife's job, and since the kids are picky, he's worried about managing meals without her. He thinks prepping would make things easier. The wife, on the other hand, is going on her first trip away from the kids and is maybe stressed about that. She feels it's too much to ask her to prep meals, suggesting sandwiches as an alternative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. The husband might not realize how the request affects his wife. Meal prepping for a week can be tedious and time-consuming. If the wife feels overwhelmed by the trip itself, adding meal prep could add stress. The husband's intention is good\u2014he wants to plan ahead\u2014but he might not have considered her perspective or workload.\n\nOn the flip side, the husband is also taking on a lot by managing everything alone for a week. He's probably trying to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. However, the wife's refusal might indicate that she's either too busy or finds the request unreasonable. It's possible the husband didn't communicate his concerns clearly or offer alternatives. Maybe he could have asked for something less intensive, like prepping just a few meals instead of all seven days.\n\nAnother angle is the division of responsibilities. If cooking is her usual role, then maybe the husband should take some initiative to adjust without making her do extra work. But since it's her first time away, maybe she's already stressed about leaving the kids and doesn't want to add more to her plate. The husband's request might be valid, but the way he framed it could come across as not considering her feelings.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He's not trying to be a jerk; he's trying to manage his own stress. However, he might be overlooking his wife's current stressors and not offering enough support or flexibility. The wife's response suggests that the request is burdensome, so maybe the husband should have been more accommodating or found a middle ground. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her perspective enough, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's asking for help before the trip. Hmm. I think leaning towards A because the request could be seen as adding stress to her trip preparations without considering her feelings.\n"
