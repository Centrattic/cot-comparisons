      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nSo the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky eaters and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying that's too much work. He argues it's not unfair since she's taking a week off, and he just wants to avoid meltdowns over not having the usual food. He's not the one going on the trip, so why can't she help by prepping?\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's taking on an extra week's worth of responsibilities, including cooking for picky kids. He's asking for help in a way that makes sense given his inexperience. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that being asked to prep meals is an added burden, especially if she's already stressed about her trip or if she's already doing most of the cooking regularly.\n\nBut wait, the trip is her time away, so maybe she's trying to focus on her own plans. If she's already the primary cook, asking her to do prep might be reasonable, but she might feel it's too much. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. He's not asking her to do something during the trip; he's asking her to prepare before she leaves. That seems fair because once she's gone, he's on his own.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's already overwhelmed with her own trip preparations and doesn't want the added stress of meal prepping. Or perhaps she doesn't want to be seen as the one always responsible for cooking, even when she's not home. It's possible there's an underlying issue here about division of labor in the household. If the husband isn't used to cooking, maybe he should practice more, but he's worried about the kids' reactions.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's asking for a reasonable request (meal prepping before the trip) to make things manageable, then it's not unreasonable. However, if the wife has valid reasons for not wanting to do it, like it's too much work, then maybe the husband needs to adjust his expectations. But the wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might indicate a lack of support, which could be a problem too.\n\nI need to think about fairness. The husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid problems. The wife is taking time off, so he's stepping in. It's common for one partner to handle more household tasks, but if the husband isn't as skilled, asking for help makes sense. The wife's refusal might stem from stress or feeling overburdened. Maybe the husband didn't consider her feelings when making the request. If he approached it as a collaborative effort rather than a demand, maybe it would have gone better. But the core issue is whether the request itself is fair. Since it's before her trip, and she's not doing it while away, it seems like a valid ask. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
