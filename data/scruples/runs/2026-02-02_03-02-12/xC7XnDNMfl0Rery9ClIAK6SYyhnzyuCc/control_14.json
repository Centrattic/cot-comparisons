She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since the kids were born. He'll be handling all the chores and cooking alone for a week. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he asked her to prep dinners for the week so he doesn't have to deal with the stress of cooking unfamiliar meals. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard. The author feels it's fair to ask her since she's going away, but the wife disagrees. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. So the main points here are about fairness and expectations in household responsibilities. The author is asking for help in advance to manage a challenging period when he'll be overwhelmed. The wife is feeling that it's too much to ask, perhaps because of the time required or maybe she feels it's not her responsibility anymore. \n\nFirst, is it reasonable to ask someone to prepare meals before a trip? If they're going to be away and the preparation can be done before they leave, it might be a common practice. For example, people often meal prep for trips to save time later. However, the wife might feel that since she's not there to cook, the responsibility shifts to the husband. But the husband is already stressed because he's managing everything alone, and the kids are picky, making it harder for him to adjust.\n\nThe wife's response of offering sandwiches seems dismissive. If the kids are picky, sandwiches might not be suitable. The author is trying to avoid meltdowns due to unfamiliar food, which is a valid concern. So, is the author overstepping by asking for meal prep, or is the wife not being supportive?\n\nIt depends on their usual dynamics. If cooking is her responsibility and she's going away, preparing meals in advance could be a reasonable way to help. But if the wife feels that because she's leaving, she shouldn't have to do the prep, maybe she's right. However, the author is asking for help before the trip, so it's a proactive step. The wife's reaction could be about the workload, but maybe she's not considering the husband's stress. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have offered to compensate her or to take on something else in return. But the situation doesn't mention that. The key here is whether the request is fair. If the wife is going on a trip and the husband is taking on her chores, it might be fair for her to help in advance. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, B.\n"
