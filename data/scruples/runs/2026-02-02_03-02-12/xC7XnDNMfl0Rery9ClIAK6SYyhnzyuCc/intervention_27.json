It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is concerned about handling the chores and cooking, which the wife usually does. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches. The author thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help because he's worried about managing without her. The wife is going on a trip, so maybe she's already stressed or has her own preparations. The husband's request is reasonable in that he's trying to plan ahead to avoid problems with picky eaters. However, the wife's reaction might indicate that the request is seen as an added burden on top of her trip prep. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to meal prep when she's going away? Well, she's the one who normally handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better. Prepping meals could save the husband time and stress. But maybe she's already busy with her own trip and feels it's too much. The husband's reasoning is that since she's the one going away, it's fair to ask her to do this. But maybe the wife feels that since she's not there to help, the husband should adjust instead. \n\nI think the key points are mutual understanding and communication. The husband's intention is to reduce his own stress, which is valid. However, the wife's perspective is that it's too much work for her. The question is whether the husband's request is unreasonable. Since the wife is the one who usually cooks and knows the kids better, asking her to prepare meals could be seen as a reasonable request. But maybe the timing (right before her trip) is an issue. \n\nI don't think the husband is in the wrong. He's trying to manage responsibilities and is upfront about his needs. The wife's reaction is more about the burden on her side. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
