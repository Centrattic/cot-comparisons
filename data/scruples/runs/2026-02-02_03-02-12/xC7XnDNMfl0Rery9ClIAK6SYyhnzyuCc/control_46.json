On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife is going away for the first time since having kids. The husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky. He wants her to prepare dinners for the week to make things easier for him. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and offered sandwiches instead.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The husband's request is reasonable in that he's trying to manage the household alone. Since the wife cooks more often and knows the kids' preferences, meal prepping might be the most efficient way. However, the wife is going on a trip, which is a break for her. Asking her to prep meals before leaving could add stress. She might feel that the request is unreasonable because she's already preparing for her trip and might not have the time or energy. Her response about sandwiches suggests she's trying to make a compromise, maybe thinking that sandwiches are easier. \n\nBut is the husband wrong for asking? Well, he's not making her do anything; he's just requesting help to cope with the situation. The wife has the agency to say no. However, the way he framed it might have made her feel it's a demand rather than a request. The key here is whether the request was reasonable. Meal prepping isn't unusual, but if the wife is already stressed about the trip, adding that task might be too much. The husband might not have considered her perspective, thinking only about his own needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention is to avoid problems with the kids' meals, which is a valid concern. He's not being selfish; he's trying to maintain stability at home. The wife's refusal could be because she's overwhelmed, but she could also have discussed it more calmly. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's asking for help in a logical way. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or other issues. The husband's need for help is legitimate, and expecting the wife to preplan meals when she's going to be away isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in the communication, but the request itself is reasonable. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
