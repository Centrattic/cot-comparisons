It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip because he's worried about handling the kids' meals by himself during her absence. The wife gets upset and says it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's perspective: he's taking over all the chores and cooking for the first time, which he isn't used to. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He's trying to avoid meltdowns by having prepped meals. That seems reasonable. He's asking her to do something that would make the next week easier for him, and since she's going away, maybe he's right to ask.\n\nOn the wife's side: she's going on a trip, which is her first time away. She might feel overwhelmed with the prep work on top of her own trip preparations. She could be stressed or tired, hence the upset reaction. She's also suggesting a simpler alternative (sandwiches), which is easier for him but maybe not ideal for the kids.\n\nNow, considering their roles. Cooking is her responsibility, so if she's the primary cook, it's natural for her to know the kids' preferences. But the husband is relying on her to do prep before leaving. Is that a fair request? If she's going away, maybe she's available to prep before the trip. However, if she's already busy with her own travel prep, maybe the husband's request is adding extra work.\n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? He's not forcing her, just asking. The wife's response of being upset might be because she feels the request is burdensome. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The husband's concern is valid, but he should consider her workload and stress. Conversely, the wife could have explained her stress and maybe compromised, like prepping a few meals instead of all.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is trying to prepare, which is responsible. The wife's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings are valid if she's overwhelmed. The key is whether the husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since it's a week's prep, which might take some time, and she's going away, maybe it's a valid concern. But the husband should have had a discussion to understand her side.\n\nSo, is the author (the husband) in the wrong? It depends on the wife's capacity. If she's able to do the prep without it being too much, then the husband isn't wrong. But if she's already stressed and the prep adds too much, then maybe the husband didn't consider her feelings enough. The question is whether the request is reasonable. Since the wife is the one cooking normally, asking her to prep a bit before leaving might be fair. However, her reaction might be because she feels taken advantage of. The answer might be that the husband isn't in the wrong, but both sides have valid points. However, the user is to answer A or B. The husband's request is reasonable, so he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
