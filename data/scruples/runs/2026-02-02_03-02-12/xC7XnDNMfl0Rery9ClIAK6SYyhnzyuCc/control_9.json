I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going away for a week, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over all her chores, including cooking. He's asking her to prep dinners for the week because the kids are picky and he's not confident in his ability to manage without her. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work and offers sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, is the husband being reasonable? Well, he's taking on a lot by covering her half of the chores. It's understandable that he wants some support, especially with picky eaters. Meal prepping might be a way to reduce his workload. But the wife is already leaving, and he's adding another task to her pre-trip responsibilities. Maybe the issue is about the timing or the feasibility. She might feel that preparing seven days of meals on top of packing for her trip is too much. \n\nThe husband argues that he doesn't want the kids to be upset if the food isn't right. He's trying to prevent meltdowns. But maybe the wife feels that she's already giving up time by being away, and this extra task is unfair. Or perhaps she underestimates the effort required for meal prepping, thinking it's just a matter of making sandwiches. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the husband could take on more cooking than he's comfortable with, or they could discuss compromises. The key here is communication. The husband's request is understandable, but the wife's reaction suggests it's a point of contention. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the request is reasonable. Since he's not forcing her but asking for help, and considering that it's her first time away, maybe he's not wrong. However, if he had already agreed to her not prepping, then maybe. But from the context, he's asking her to help before the trip, which she's refusing. So he's not in the wrong for making the request, but maybe the way he framed it or the timing could be an issue. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have considered that she's already stressed about the trip and adding meal prep is too much. But the user's reasoning is that he's asking her to do something that's manageable and will make his week easier. If she's able to do it, maybe he's not wrong. But if she's already overburdened, then maybe he is. However, since she's the one who's not cooking during the trip, it's her responsibility to prepare. So perhaps not wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
