She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. He asked her to prep meals for the week to make it easier, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's worried about the kids' meltdowns if they don't get their usual food.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the husband is asking for help because he's taking on more responsibilities while the wife is away. He's not asking her to do something during her trip, just before she leaves, so she can prepare meals for the week. The wife is upset, maybe because she feels it's too much to ask, or perhaps she's stressed. \n\nIs meal prepping a reasonable request? Well, since she's the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences better, it's logical that he'd want her to prepare meals. He's not making her cook while she's away, just asking her to do the prep work before she goes. That seems fair. But why is she upset? Maybe she's already planning her trip and doesn't want the extra work, or maybe she feels the request is unfair. \n\nBut the husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking, and the kids are picky. He wants to avoid meltdowns. It seems like a practical solution. If she's capable of prepping meals before her trip, then the request isn't unreasonable. However, maybe she has valid reasons for not wanting to do it. But the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong, not whether the wife's reaction is valid. \n\nThe key points: The husband is asking for something that's within the wife's capacity before her trip. He's not asking her to do it during the trip. The request is to make things easier for him during her absence. Since it's her first time away, maybe she's anxious about the trip or other things, but the husband's request is practical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's overstepping by dictating what she should do during her time off. But meal prepping is a common way people help out in relationships. It's about dividing responsibilities. Since he's taking on her chores, it's reasonable to ask her to help with this part. \n\nSo, I think the husband isn't in the wrong. He's trying to manage household responsibilities during her absence. The wife's reaction might be valid from her perspective, but that doesn't mean the husband is wrong for making the request. Answer B, No.\n"
