It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is concerned about handling the chores and cooking, which is the wife's usual responsibility. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he can make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is taking on a significant new responsibility for the week. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. It's reasonable for him to want to minimize stress during this period. Meal prepping could help maintain routines and prevent meltdowns, which is in the kids' best interest. \n\nHowever, the wife is being asked to do extra work before her trip. Maybe she's already preparing for the trip and feels overwhelmed. If the request was made close to her departure, it might add to her stress. The way the request was communicated might also matter. Was it a reasonable ask given the timing and her workload?\n\nThe husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. But the wife's reaction suggests she might feel the request is unfair or unconsidered. It's possible she didn't anticipate needing to prep meals and now feels it's an added burden. \n\nThe key here is balance. Both partners have responsibilities. The husband is asking for help to manage a challenging week, but the wife might not have the capacity. It's a communication issue\u2014maybe they didn't discuss expectations beforehand. The husband could have considered alternative solutions, like compromising on the number of meals or asking for a different kind of help. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's trying to prepare for a situation that's new and stressful for both of them. However, not considering his wife's perspective and workload might be a misstep. But his reasoning is valid. The answer might be a mutual understanding situation, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he has a valid reason, perhaps the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
