It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prep the dinners for the week before she leaves. The main points are that the wife usually does the cooking, the kids are picky, and the husband is worried about handling it alone. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggests making sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is practical. He's taking on a lot more responsibility during her absence, and since the kids are picky, prepping meals could prevent stress. The wife, on the other hand, feels that being asked to prep is too much. Maybe she thinks she's already doing a lot, or perhaps she's overwhelmed with her own trip preparations. \n\nIs it unfair to ask her to prep? Well, the trip is her week away, so maybe she expects some time to herself. However, the husband is asking for prepped meals before she leaves. It's a one-time effort, right? If she's already leaving, maybe she can do the prep in the days before her trip. The husband's request is to make it easier for him, which is reasonable. \n\nBut why did she get upset? Maybe she feels it's an additional task on top of her packing and work. Or perhaps she feels like her efforts aren't being appreciated. The husband says he doesn't think it's unfair because she's the one going away. That makes sense. If she's taking the time, she might have the capacity to do the prep. \n\nOn the flip side, the husband could have considered that maybe she's stressed about the trip or has her own things to handle. Maybe there was a better way to communicate the request. But the core of the question is whether the request itself is unfair. \n\nThe husband is in a tough spot, handling all the chores and cooking, which he's not as used to. The wife's suggestion to make sandwiches might be a cop-out. The kids might not like sandwiches, leading to meltdowns, which is what the husband wants to avoid. \n\nSo, the husband's request is pragmatic. He's trying to manage his responsibilities. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or feeling overwhelmed. But is the husband in the wrong? I don't think so. He's asking for help in a reasonable way. The answer is probably B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
