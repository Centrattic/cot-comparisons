      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The author has to take over her chores and cooking, but he's not as experienced. The wife got upset when he asked to prepp the dinners, saying it's too much work and offered to make sandwiches instead. The author feels it's not unfair because she's taking the week off.\n\nHmm. First, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is about meal prepping. The author is asking for support because he's overwhelmed with the idea of cooking for the kids alone. He's working and managing chores, and the kids are picky. His wife usually handles cooking, so he's asking her to preplan meals to make his week easier.\n\nThe wife's reaction is that it's too much work for her, and she suggests sandwiches as an alternative. The author is upset because he wants to avoid the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't what they're used to. So he's trying to prevent stress during her trip, but she doesn't want to prep. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider the fairness here. The wife is about to go on a trip, so maybe she's already busy packing or preparing for her travel. But the author is asking her to do something that would help him manage the household better. Is it reasonable to ask her to prep before leaving? Meal prepping can be a significant task, especially if she's trying to accommodate the kids' specific preferences. If the wife feels that's too much, perhaps the author should respect her limits. However, the author is in a tough spot, handling everything alone.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's half of the chores are now the author's responsibility. Cooking is part of that. If she's not there, he has to step in. But maybe the author isn't expecting her to do the work while she's away. The wife is upset because she might feel it's an additional burden before her trip. The author's request is for her to prepare meals in advance. The wife is refusing, which could lead to him struggling during the week.\n\nIs the author being selfish by expecting her to prep, or is he being reasonable in seeking help to manage the situation? The wife's response suggests she doesn't want to do the prep, but maybe she's right in not overextending herself. The author could have asked earlier, but maybe he didn't. The wife might already have a lot to do. However, the author's intention is to make the transition easier, not to make her work during her trip. So he's asking her to do the prep before she leaves.\n\nMaybe the author could have been more considerate in how he asked, but the request itself isn't inherently wrong. The wife has the right to say no, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. He's trying to manage the household. Alternatively, if the wife is already stressed about her trip, adding meal prep might be too much. Communication is key here. The author's concern about the kids' meltdowns is valid, so he's acting in their best interest. But the wife's feelings about the request matter too. If she's in a position where she can't do it, the author needs to find another solution. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for making the request. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request was reasonable. Since he's asking her to prep before the trip, it's not during her time away. So he's not making her do work while she's gone. He's just asking her to prepare in advance. If she's overwhelmed, maybe she should express that before the trip, but the author's request seems reasonable. The wife's response was to tell him to make sandwiches, which are easy, but maybe the author wants more varied meals. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. He's seeking help to manage a challenging situation. The wife has the right to refuse, but that doesn't make the author at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
