It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time since the kids were born. The husband has to take over her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually handles. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asks her to prep dinners, but she gets upset, saying it's too much work. He feels it's reasonable because she's going away and he wants to avoid meltdowns from unfamiliar food.\n\nSo, the main points here are about division of labor, expectations during absence, and mutual understanding. The husband's reasoning is that since she's not there, it's logical for her to prepare meals in advance to ease his burden. The wife feels it's too much work and offers an alternative (sandwiches), which might not meet the kids' preferences.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. He's trying to plan ahead, which is reasonable. He's taking on an extra workload without her help, so asking her to prep could be seen as a way to share the responsibility. However, maybe he didn't consider her workload before the trip, or she might already be stressed about the trip, making the prep too much. But the wife's response seems dismissive; offering sandwiches might not be practical if the kids are picky. There's a communication issue here, perhaps. The husband's request is practical, but the wife might feel overwhelmed. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is going to be away, it's logical for her to prepare what she can before leaving. The husband's request isn't unreasonable. The wife's reaction might be because she feels the request is excessive, especially if she's busy. But the husband is trying to avoid problems during the week. \n\nI think the key is whether the request is fair given the circumstances. Since the wife is going to be away, asking her to prep meals for the week could be a way to balance their usual responsibilities. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable; he's trying to maintain the kids' routine. The wife's refusal and the suggestion of sandwiches might not address the kids' needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
