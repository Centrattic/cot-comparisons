It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. He normally doesn't cook, and the kids are picky, so he asked her to prep meals. She got upset, said it's too much, and suggested he just make sandwiches. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable. He's asking for help to manage a challenging week. Since the kids are picky and his wife knows their preferences better, prepping meals would make his job easier. He's not forcing her; he's asking. But she's taking it as an imposition. Maybe she feels overwhelmed or it's too much added work for her trip.\n\nBut then again, maybe she's already busy with her trip arrangements and doesn't have the capacity to prep meals. Her response of \"just make sandwiches\" could be a way to set boundaries. The husband might not realize that she's already stressed about the trip or that she feels the request is too much on top of her other responsibilities.\n\nI should think about communication. Did they discuss this beforehand? Were there previous discussions about dividing chores? If the husband has never cooked before, suddenly being expected to handle everything might be unrealistic. However, asking her to prep meals is a proactive step to avoid a stressful situation. But perhaps the wife feels that he's not taking responsibility or that he's not being considerate of her current workload.\n\nAnother angle: the wife is leaving, so maybe the husband is right to ask her to help as much as possible before she goes. But if she's already overwhelmed, maybe it's not fair to add more. It's a balance. The husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. The wife's reaction might be about feeling overburdened or a lack of support from her husband.\n\nIn terms of fairness, is it reasonable to ask for meal prep? It depends on their usual dynamic. If cooking is her responsibility and she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, then asking her to prep meals could be logical. But if she's already taking time off, maybe expecting her to do extra work isn't fair. There's a conflict here between his need for support and her need for space or time.\n\nThe key might be whether the husband is respecting her boundaries. If she's upset, maybe he should have discussed it more, considered her workload, or offered alternatives. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his request is reasonable and she's not willing to help, maybe he's not at fault. However, if he didn't consider her perspective, maybe he is.\n\nI think the answer would hinge on mutual understanding. If he's asking in good faith and she's not responding constructively, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's imposing without considering her feelings, maybe he is. The fact that she's taking a week away might mean she's already stressed, so asking for meal prep could add to her stress. So, perhaps the husband isn't wrong, but maybe he could have approached it differently. However, the user's question is if he's in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because his request is reasonable, and he's trying to manage a difficult situation. The wife's reaction is her issue, but the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
