      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The author is taking over all her chores, including cooking, which is normally her responsibility. He asked her to meal prep for the week so he doesn't have to deal with the kids' picky eating and possible meltdowns. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested that if it's too hard, he can just make sandwiches. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for asking her to meal prep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to make things easier for himself because he's taking on a lot more responsibilities. Cooking for picky kids is not easy, especially when you're also working and handling other chores. Meal prepping could save a lot of time and stress during the week. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is a time she might need to prepare, but she might also have her own plans or limitations. She's upset because she might feel it's an extra burden added to her pre-trip tasks, or maybe she's already stressed about being away. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals before a trip? Well, if they usually split chores, and cooking is her part, maybe she should expect that when she's not there, he might need some help. But since she's going away, maybe it's reasonable for her to prepare in advance. However, if she's going on a trip, maybe she's already dealing with her own preparations, so asking her to do extra work might be adding to her stress. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not as experienced with the kids' eating habits, so prepped meals by her would help avoid meltdowns. That makes sense. But why would she be upset? Maybe she feels it's too much to ask, especially since she's already going to be away. Or perhaps she feels that he should take on the task himself, even if it's challenging. \n\nIt's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he's trying to plan ahead to make things manageable. However, maybe he didn't consider her workload or her feelings about being asked to do more work right before a trip. There's also the aspect of communication. Did he present the request in a way that was understanding of her situation? Maybe the wife feels that he's not trusting her to handle her part of the responsibilities or that he's not willing to adapt. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is used to handling cooking, and the author is stepping up but needs support, asking her to preplan could be reasonable. But if she's already stressed about the trip, maybe he should have offered to help with the meal prep or found another solution. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances and how both parties are handling their responsibilities. \n\nAnother angle: The author is asking her to do work for the household before a trip, which could be seen as part of her responsibility. But if the trip is her time away, maybe he should adjust without her help. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is fair and if there's mutual understanding. If the wife is already overwhelmed with her trip prep, asking for meal prep might be too much. But if it's a usual part of their routine and she's capable, then it's a valid request. Since the author's main concern is preventing meltdowns due to unfamiliar food, which is a valid parent concern, maybe he's not wrong. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she might feel the request is excessive. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions are good, but maybe he didn't consider her current situation. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might depend on the perception of fairness. If the wife is the usual cook and the author is asking her to plan ahead, it's reasonable. But if she's already stressed, maybe not. Since the answer options are A or B, and the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, I might lean towards B. But I need to make sure.\n"
