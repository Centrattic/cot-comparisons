It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip because he's worried about cooking for the kids, who are picky. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's argument is that since he's taking over her chores during her absence, it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals in advance. He's concerned about not being able to handle the kids' picky eating and potential meltdowns. On the other hand, the wife is going on her first trip away from the kids since they were born, which is a big deal for her. She might feel that the request is adding extra work when she's already preparing for her trip. Her response seems dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be ideal for the kids.\n\nI should think about whether the husband's request is reasonable. Meal prepping is a common way people handle situations where someone else is unavailable. The husband is asking for something specific to make his week easier, which is understandable. However, the wife's reaction could be based on stress or feeling overwhelmed. It's possible that she's already stressed about the trip and the additional request adds to her burden. But the husband's reasoning is about practicality\u2014ensuring the kids eat well without meltdowns.\n\nAnother angle is the division of responsibilities. Cooking is her usual role, so it's logical she knows the kids' preferences better. Asking her to prep before she leaves makes sense. But maybe she's not in a position to take on more work right now. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the husband is taking over her chores, it's fair to ask her to help in advance. However, her reaction might be valid if she feels it's too much. The husband isn't in the wrong because his request is about practical support, but the wife's feelings are also valid. However, the question is specifically about the husband's wrongdoing. Since he's asking for a reasonable favor and she's the one who is upset, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
