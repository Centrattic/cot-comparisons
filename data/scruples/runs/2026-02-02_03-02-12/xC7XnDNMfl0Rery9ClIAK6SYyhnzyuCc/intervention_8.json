It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The author's wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The author is taking over her chores, including cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better, so he asked her to prep dinners. She got upset and refused, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is valid. He's handling a lot more responsibilities alone, and he's trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids. Meal prepping might be a reasonable request since she's the one who's been doing the cooking and knows the kids' likes. But why did the wife get upset? Maybe she feels it's too much work or doesn't want to take on extra before her trip. Maybe she's stressed about her trip or the separation from the kids. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage a situation that's already stressful. The wife's refusal could be due to her own stress or workload. But the author is trying to avoid a problem by getting the meals ready. It's a practical request. But maybe the author could have discussed it differently, like understanding her perspective first. Maybe he assumed she could do it without considering her current workload or stress. However, the core issue is that he's trying to make his week easier, which is understandable. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
