It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The author's wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky. He asked her to prep the dinners, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and offered to make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is taking over his wife's usual responsibilities, which is understandable since she's not there. The request is about meal prepping to make his task easier. The wife's reaction seems a bit strong, but maybe there's more context. \n\nThe author argues that it's reasonable because she's going to be away, so she should prepare in advance. Meal prepping is common in many households, especially when one partner is away. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or feels that the author should handle it without extra help. \n\nBut the author is not wrong in wanting to make things easier. He's being proactive to avoid potential meltdowns from the kids. It's a practical request. The wife's response of just sandwiches might not be feasible given the kids' pickiness. The author's concern is valid because consistency in meals can affect the kids' behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author isn't considering her workload or that he should be able to manage without her. However, since she's the one going away, it's reasonable to ask her to prepare, especially since she's more familiar with the kids' preferences. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nI think the author is justified in his request. He's not overstepping; he's asking for help to manage his responsibilities during her absence. The wife's reaction might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for making the request. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
