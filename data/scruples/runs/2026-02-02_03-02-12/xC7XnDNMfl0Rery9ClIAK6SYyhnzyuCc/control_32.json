It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time the husband is handling everything alone with the kids. Cooking is usually her job, and the kids are picky, so he wants her to prep meals to make it easier. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests he can make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nFirst, the husband's perspective: He's overwhelmed because this is his first time managing alone. He's asking for help in a way he thinks will reduce stress. He's trying to maintain a routine for the kids by having familiar meals, which he thinks his wife knows better. So he's asking her to do something that he believes is necessary to avoid meltdowns.\n\nThe wife's reaction: She finds the request too much. Maybe because she's already preparing for her trip, and adding meal prep is extra work. Or maybe she feels it's unfair since she's going away and not there to help. She suggests sandwiches as an alternative, which the husband might see as less ideal but a fallback.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong in wanting help. It's reasonable to ask a spouse for assistance, especially in a stressful situation. However, the way he asked might have been an issue. If he made it sound like a demand rather than a request, that could cause tension. Also, considering her perspective, she might be in her own preparations and not feel like taking on more. The key is whether the request is reasonable and if there was a discussion about it. If he communicated his concerns and needs, then it's not wrong. If he assumed or didn't consider her workload, that's different. But from the description, he does explain his reasoning (kids' preferences, his own inexperience), so he's not in the wrong. The wife is also within her rights to push back if she feels it's too much. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The situation is a bit of a grey area, but the husband's request is understandable and not unreasonable.\n"
