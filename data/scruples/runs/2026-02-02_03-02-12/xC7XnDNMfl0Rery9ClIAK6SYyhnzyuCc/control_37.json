It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nSo the situation is: the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband has to take over all her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually handles. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asks her to prep meals for the week, but she gets upset, saying it's too much work and suggests he can make sandwiches instead. The husband doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns from unfamiliar food. He thinks it's fair to ask her to prep since she's the one leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's overwhelmed with new responsibilities and wants to minimize stress by having meals prepped, especially since the kids are picky. The wife is upset because meal prepping for a week might be a lot of extra work on top of her trip preparations.\n\nIs the husband being reasonable? Well, he's asking her to do something before her trip, which is a valid request. It's common for people to ask family to help prepare meals when they're going away, especially with kids involved. He's not forcing her to do something dangerous or unethical. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding to her stress before a trip, especially if she's already busy. Maybe she didn't expect the prep time, or maybe she feels it's not her responsibility now that she's leaving.\n\nBut considering that the husband is taking over her usual responsibilities, it's logical to ask her to help with something that's time-consuming. The wife could argue that she's already gone, so the prep should be her responsibility before leaving. But if she's upset, maybe the amount of prep is too much. The husband's reasoning is about avoiding meltdowns from the kids, which is a valid concern for a parent.\n\nThe key points are: the husband is asking for help to manage a challenging week, the wife is leaving, and the kids need consistency. The wife's response might be a bit dismissive (\"just make sandwiches\") when the husband's request is about maintaining routine. The husband's request is reasonable because he's trying to prevent problems. The wife's refusal could be because of the workload, but the husband is trying to be proactive. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong here. He's trying to set himself up for success during a stressful week. The wife's reaction might be a communication issue. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
