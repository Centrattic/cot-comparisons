It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about handling the kids and chores, especially cooking. Since the wife usually does the cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, he asked her to prep meals. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is at fault. The user thinks he's not in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband's request is practical. He's taking on a lot more responsibility for the week, and meal prep would help reduce stress. The wife is the primary cook, and her knowledge of the kids' preferences is a valid reason to ask her to prep. She's going on the trip by choice, so it's reasonable to expect her to help make the transition easier for him.\n\nBut why did she get upset? Maybe she feels overburdened. Meal prepping for a week could be time-consuming or physically demanding. She might feel that the husband isn't considering her workload before the trip. Also, if she's the one who typically handles cooking, he might be overstepping by assigning that task to her again, even if she's leaving. There's a balance between shared responsibility and acknowledging each other's strengths.\n\nThe husband's intention is to avoid meltdowns from the kids, which is a legitimate concern. However, his approach might come across as not valuing her input or her current capacity. Maybe there's a communication issue here. If he had discussed it earlier or offered to assist with some prep, it might have been better received. But overall, his request seems reasonable given the circumstances. The wife's refusal could stem from stress or feeling that her own needs aren't being considered. \n\nIn terms of fairness, since she's the primary cook and the trip is her first time away, it's a valid ask. However, the way he framed the request might have been insensitive. The key here is whether the request was reasonable and communicated respectfully. If he acknowledged her workload and offered support, it would be different. But from the given info, he's asking her to do something she's already doing, just in advance. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the request is practical and based on his need for support. However, there might be room for discussion on how the request was communicated. But in terms of right or wrong, he's not at fault.\n"
