I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife going on a trip and him asking her to preplan the dinners for the week. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author wants his wife to meal prep because he's not as confident in cooking for the kids, who are picky. He's taking over her chores while she's away, which includes cooking. He asks her to prep the meals so he doesn't have to deal with potential meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. The wife gets upset, saying it's too much work and offers to make sandwiches instead. The author thinks it's fair to ask, considering she's going away for a week.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's trying to manage without her help, and meal prep would make things easier. He's not asking her to do it all, just prep before the trip. It's reasonable to want some help, especially since the kids are picky and he's not as familiar with their preferences. On the other hand, the wife might feel that being away is already a lot, and prep work adds extra stress. Maybe she thinks the author should handle it himself since she's not there. But he's not asking her to be there; he's just asking for prepped meals. \n\nIs there an imbalance in the responsibilities? If they usually split chores, maybe the wife does most of the cooking. The author is asking for help in her absence, which could be seen as fair. However, if the wife has other things to do before her trip, maybe the timing isn't right. But the author is asking her to prep before the trip, so it's not during her time away. \n\nPossible issues: The author's request is reasonable, but maybe the way he asked could have been more considerate. However, the wife's reaction seems a bit harsh. If she's willing to do sandwiches but not full meals, maybe that's her way of simplifying. But the author's concern about the kids' preferences is valid. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is trying to make the transition easier for himself and the kids, which is a valid reason. The wife's refusal might be more about not wanting to take on extra work before her trip. But the author isn't making her do anything while she's away; he's just asking for pre-trip prep. So, I don't see the author as in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
