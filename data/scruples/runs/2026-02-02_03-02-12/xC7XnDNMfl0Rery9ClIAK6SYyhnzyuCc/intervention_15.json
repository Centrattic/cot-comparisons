It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband will be handling everything alone for the first time. The wife normally does the cooking, and the kids are picky. The husband wants her to prep meals for the week so it's easier on him. She got upset and said it's too much work, offering that he can just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is reasonable in wanting to make sure the kids have familiar meals since they're picky. The wife is going away, so the timing of the request is before her trip. The husband isn't asking her to work during the trip; he's asking her to prepare before she leaves. That seems logical. However, the wife feels it's too much work. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels overwhelmed. \n\nBut from an outsider's perspective, asking someone to prepare meals before they leave for a trip is a common practice to reduce stress for the person staying behind. The husband is acknowledging that he can do it, but he's trying to make it easier. It's not like he's making her do it during her trip; he's asking her to do it beforehand. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might come off as dismissive, especially if the kids aren't into sandwiches. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is valid: he's trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids. The wife's refusal could be due to her own feelings of being overloaded or maybe a different approach to the situation. However, the husband isn't being unreasonable here. He's setting expectations before she leaves, which is a responsible move. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to plan ahead and make things manageable. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed, but the husband's request is practical. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
