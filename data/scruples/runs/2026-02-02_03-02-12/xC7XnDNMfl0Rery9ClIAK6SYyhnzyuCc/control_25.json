It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. They have kids, and the wife usually handles cooking. He's worried about managing the kids' picky eating and the chores alone. She's upset and thinks it's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Marriage often involves teamwork and compromise. The husband is asking for help because he's taking on more responsibilities. The wife is going on a trip, which is a common scenario where people plan ahead. Meal prepping is a way to ease the burden, especially with kids involved. But she's resisting, maybe feeling overwhelmed or not wanting to take on extra work before her trip. \n\nIs it fair for him to ask her to prep? Well, he's acknowledging that she knows the kids' preferences better, so it's logical to ask her. However, she might feel it's an unfair request because she's already going on a trip and might be stressed about that. The key point is whether his request is reasonable. Since he's taking over her usual responsibilities, asking her to help in advance could be seen as fair. But if she's already dealing with her own prep for the trip, adding meal prepping might be too much. \n\nAlso, their communication seems important here. He might not have considered her workload or her feelings about the request. Maybe she's stressed about her trip and doesn't want extra tasks. The husband's intention is to avoid meltdowns with the kids, which is valid, but he needs to be considerate of her situation. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not entirely wrong because he's trying to manage the household, which is a shared responsibility. However, not considering her perspective might make him at fault. The answer might depend on their usual communication and how they handle responsibilities. But generally, asking for help in a reasonable way isn't wrong, but maybe he didn't approach it the best way. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since his request is practical and he's not overstepping, probably not. The answer might be B (No).\n"
