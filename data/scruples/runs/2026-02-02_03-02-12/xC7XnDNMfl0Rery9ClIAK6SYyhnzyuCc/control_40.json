It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The author is handling all the chores and cooking, which is usually the wife's job. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and offered to just have sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author's reasoning is that since the wife is going away, it's reasonable to ask her to prepare meals in advance to make his week easier, especially with the kids being picky. The wife, on the other hand, feels that prepping a week's worth of meals is too much to ask and suggests a simpler alternative.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep? Well, considering that she's going on a trip, maybe she's already preparing other things. But the author's argument is that he needs the help because the kids are picky and he's not as adept at cooking for them. The wife's response seems dismissive, offering sandwiches as a fallback. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to manage the household alone for the first time, and the meal prep would alleviate some stress. He's not asking for something unreasonable, just to have the meals prepped so he doesn't have to deal with the kids' meltdowns. The wife's reaction might be because she's stressed about the trip or feels overwhelmed by the request.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's possible that he didn't consider her workload before the trip. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip and adding meal prep is too much. However, the author had a legitimate need. The question is about fairness. Since he's taking over her responsibilities, maybe he should be more flexible. Alternatively, she should have offered to help within her capacity instead of being upset.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed the request more collaboratively, maybe offering alternatives if meal prep is too much. But in this case, the author's intention is to make things easier, and the wife's reaction is perhaps a bit harsh. However, the wife might not be in the wrong either if she's genuinely overburdened. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the request was reasonable given the circumstances. The author isn't being unreasonable to ask for help, but maybe he should have been more understanding of her possible stress. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife's response was getting upset, it might be that the author's request wasn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
