It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, their first time apart since the kids were born. The author has to take over her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky, and the author wants her to prep meals for the week to make it easier. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is asking for help to manage a situation where he's suddenly taking on a lot more responsibility. The wife is taking a break, which is understandable. But the author is trying to prepare to avoid meltdowns with the kids. The wife's response seems a bit dismissive, suggesting sandwiches as an alternative. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, asking someone to help out before a trip could be reasonable, especially if it's to make things manageable. However, it's important to consider if the request is reasonable in terms of time and effort. The wife might be feeling burnt out from cooking all along and now it's a vacation time. Maybe she didn't expect to prep for the whole week. But the author's intention is to prevent stress, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might need time to rest, and the author should have maybe discussed it earlier. But given that it's a first time alone with the kids, the author's anxiety is understandable. The author isn't forcing her; he's asking. The wife's response seems a bit abrupt. Maybe there's a communication issue here. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure the kids are fed properly. It's a practical request. The wife's refusal might be based on her own stress or the effort required. But the author's request is reasonable. So probably, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
