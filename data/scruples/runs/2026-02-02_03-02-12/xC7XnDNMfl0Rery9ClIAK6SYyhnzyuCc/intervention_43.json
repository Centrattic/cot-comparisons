      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break it down. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which the wife has been handling. He asked her to preprep the dinners for the week before she leaves to make it easier for him. But she got upset and refused, saying it's too much work and suggested sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I should consider the husband's reasoning. He mentions that the kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He's also handling all the chores and work, so the prepping would help him avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual meals. The wife, on the other hand, feels it's too much work to ask her to do the meal prep on top of her trip preparations. She's taking a week off, so maybe she's already stressed or busy with her own travel plans and packing. \n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? Well, he's asking her to do something that's a bit of a favor, but it's related to their household responsibilities. Since she's the one who cooks, and the kids are picky, it makes sense that he might want her input. However, she's about to leave, so maybe she's not in the right headspace to take on extra work. The husband might not realize how much prep time that would take her, especially if she's already dealing with her own travel logistics.\n\nThe wife's response to get upset suggests that she felt the request was unfair or added unnecessary pressure to her. Maybe she's already stressed about leaving the kids and taking the trip. The husband's reasoning is practical\u2014he wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids\u2014but his wife might feel like he's not considering her workload right before her trip. \n\nAnother angle: The husband is trying to manage household responsibilities, which is reasonable. But asking his wife to preprep might be adding to her existing burdens. The wife's counter-suggestion of sandwiches might be a way to show that she's trying to help, but maybe it's not what he wants. It's possible that the husband didn't consider that his wife might have her own limits or that the request is too much for her.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could have discussed alternatives, like prepping a few meals rather than all of them, or having the kids adjust to different meals. The husband's frustration comes from wanting consistency for the kids, but the wife might feel that the request is unrealistic given her own situation.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a bit of a grey area. The husband's intention is to manage the household better, but he might not have considered his wife's capacity to take on extra work before her trip. The wife's reaction is valid if she's overburdened. So, while the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong, maybe he could have approached the request more sensitively, considering her perspective. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B (no) because his request is based on a practical need to manage the household during her absence. However, he could have been more considerate of her workload. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and he's not maliciously asking for something unreasonable, the answer is likely B.\n"
