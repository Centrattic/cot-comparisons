It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep for the kids during her absence. The wife gets upset and refuses, offering sandwiches as an alternative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so the husband is taking over her responsibilities. Cooking is her main duty, and the kids are picky. The husband's request is to meal prep to avoid meltdowns. \n\nThe wife's reaction is that it's too much work. But the husband thinks it's a fair request since she's taking a week off. Now, the key points here are communication and fairness. The husband's intention is to make things easier, not to burden her. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work before her trip, especially if she's already preparing for it. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage the situation he's stepping into. Meal prepping is a reasonable solution given the circumstances. The wife's response suggests she might feel it's an unfair request, but the husband's reasoning is valid. It's possible that the wife might not have considered the husband's stress levels or the kids' needs. However, the husband could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing it earlier or finding a compromise. But the core issue is whether the request itself is unfair. \n\nConsidering that the wife is going away and the husband is taking on her responsibilities, asking her to prepare meals for the week before her trip isn't unreasonable. It's a proactive measure. The wife's refusal might be due to her own stress about the trip or feeling overburdened. So, the husband isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
