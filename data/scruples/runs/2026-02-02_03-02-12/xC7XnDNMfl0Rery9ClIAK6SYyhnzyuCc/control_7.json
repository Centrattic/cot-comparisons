It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife is going away for a week, and he asked her to meal prep dinners for the kids so he can manage without her. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife is the primary cook, and the kids are picky. The author is worried about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't as expected. He's taking over her chores and work, so he's under stress. He's asking for help by having her prep meals before she leaves. The wife's response was negative, which he's questioning.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's request is reasonable because he's aware of his limitations and the kids' preferences. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable; he's trying to plan ahead to avoid a difficult week. On the other hand, the wife might feel that prepping a week's worth of meals is too much, especially if she's already busy with her own trip preparations. Maybe she didn't expect that responsibility on top of her existing tasks.\n\nBut the key point is that the author's intention is to make things easier for himself, not to impose an unfair burden. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or feeling overwhelmed. The author isn't forcing her; he's making a request. The wife has the agency to say no, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for asking. It's about communication and mutual understanding. Since the author is trying to manage his responsibilities and the wife's refusal is based on it being too much work, the blame isn't on the author. He's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
