It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking alone, especially since the kids are picky eaters and the wife knows their preferences better.\n\nThe key points here are: the wife normally handles cooking, the husband is taking over her chores for a week, and he's asking her to prep meals to make his job easier. She got upset because she thinks it's too much work. The husband feels it's reasonable to ask since she's taking a week off.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to manage the household during her absence. Since the wife is the main cook and the kids are picky, prepping meals could prevent stress and meltdowns. But maybe the wife feels that meal prepping for a week is excessive, especially if she's busy with her trip preparations. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her workload or feelings about it. However, he's also trying to be proactive to avoid problems. The wife's job might be just as demanding, so expecting her to prep could add to her stress. But if she's the one who usually knows the kids' food better, maybe it's logical to ask her to preplan. It's a bit of a grey area. The husband's intention is good, but maybe he should have discussed it more with her to find a compromise. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his request is unreasonable. Since he's asking for a favor within her usual responsibilities and it's for a short time, it's not necessarily wrong. But if she's already stressed about the trip, maybe it's too much. The community might side with the husband because he's trying to prepare, but others might say he should have considered her stress. Hmm.\n"
