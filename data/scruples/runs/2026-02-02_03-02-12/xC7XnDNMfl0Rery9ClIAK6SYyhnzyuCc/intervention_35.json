It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week to make things easier for him. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wants to avoid the kids' meltdowns from not having their usual food. He feels it's fair to ask her to prep since she's leaving for a week.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting responsibilities based on who is more capable makes sense. The wife usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences, so asking her to prep meals might be logical. However, it could also be seen as an additional burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. The key points are mutual understanding and communication.\n\nThe wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed or overworked. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip or the extra task. The husband's need for stability in the routine for the kids is valid, but he should consider her feelings and workload.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It depends on whether the request was reasonable and if they've discussed responsibilities beforehand. If they've always split chores and this is a one-time adjustment, it's understandable. But if the wife feels it's unfair, the husband should empathize and find a middle ground. The main issue is whether the request was excessive considering the circumstances.\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because his request is practical and aims to maintain the kids' routine. However, the wife's feelings are valid too. The real problem might be communication, not the request itself. So the answer would be B (No), but with a note about mutual respect and communication.\n"
