It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep for the week because he's not confident in his ability to cook for the kids, who are picky. The wife is upset and thinks it's too much to ask, suggesting he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking time off, which is her first since the kids were born. That's a big deal and she might need the break. The husband is asking her to do extra work before her trip, which could be seen as adding stress. On the other hand, he's taking over all her chores and childcare alone, so maybe he's genuinely overwhelmed.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's request is to make his week easier, but the wife finds the request burdensome. The wife's perspective might be that she's already preparing for her trip (packing, planning, etc.) and doing meal prep adds to that. The husband's concern is about the kids' reactions if the food isn't right.\n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? He's asking her to do something that would help him manage, but it's an extra task. It's possible he's not considering her workload or her need to unwind. Alternatively, he's trying to be proactive and avoid problems. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is going away and the husband is taking on her responsibilities, maybe he should have thought about meal prep earlier. But he did ask, and the wife refused. The wife might feel it's an imposition, especially if she's already busy. The husband's argument is that he's not as skilled, but maybe he could have found another solution, like prepping himself or asking for help.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to manage his own stress, but he might not be considering her perspective. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's adding to her workload before her trip, which could be seen as selfish. However, others might argue that he's being reasonable. But AITA often looks at the balance of effort and consideration. Since the wife is going on her first trip and the husband is asking for an extra task, the answer might be A.\n"
