It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for advice on whether they're the asshole for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband will have to handle all the chores and take over cooking since the wife usually does it. The kids are picky eaters, so he wants her to prep meals so he doesn't have to deal with the kids' meltdowns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, who have specific preferences. He's worried about the stress of making meals that the kids like. Since the wife is going away and this is her first time away since the kids were born, he's asking her to help him out by prepping meals. That seems reasonable because she's the one who knows their preferences better.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. Maybe she's already busy with her own preparations for the trip, or she feels like she's being asked to do extra work when she's supposed to be on a break. Also, meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and might not be feasible for her. If she's already stressed about the trip or her responsibilities, adding meal prep could be overwhelming.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's request is practical given the kids' pickiness and his inexperience. However, the wife's reaction suggests that maybe the request was either too much or not communicated in the best way. It's possible that the husband didn't consider the wife's workload or feelings about the trip. She might see this as an added burden instead of a helpful solution.\n\nAnother angle is that the husband might be underestimating his ability to cook for the kids. Maybe he can handle it, even if it's different from his wife. The wife's suggestion to make sandwiches is a simpler solution, but the husband is concerned about the kids not getting their usual food. It's a balance between practicality and the effort required.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is asking for help that's necessary for him to manage while she's away. However, the wife's refusal might stem from her own stress or feeling that the request is unreasonable. It's possible that they didn't discuss this adequately beforehand, and the husband might not have considered her perspective fully. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's genuinely struggling and the request is reasonable given the circumstances, maybe not. But if he didn't consider her feelings or workload, maybe he is. The question is whether the request is fair. Since he's the one who's not used to cooking, asking her to help before she leaves could be seen as fair. However, if she's already stressed, maybe the request is too much. \n\nOverall, the husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. The wife's response might be based on her own stress. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the husband's request seems reasonable. However, the way he communicated it might have been a problem. If he had considered her workload or offered compromises, maybe the situation would be different. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the request itself is unfair. Given that he's the one taking over and the kids are picky, asking her to prep meals for the week is a practical solution. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
