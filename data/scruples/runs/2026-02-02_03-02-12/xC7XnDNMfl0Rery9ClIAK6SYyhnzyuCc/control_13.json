It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is at fault for wanting his wife to prep meals before her trip. The situation is that his wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids' meals since she usually does the cooking. He asked her to prep the dinners, but she got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking a break, which is understandable. The husband is stepping in to manage chores, including cooking, which he's not as confident with. He's worried about the kids' reactions if the food isn't right. He's asking for help from his wife to make things easier for himself. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's going on a trip, so maybe she's already dealing with packing and planning. If he's taking on her usual responsibilities, it's logical to want some support. But she's already stressed, and the prep might add to her workload before the trip. \n\nThe key points are: Is the husband's request reasonable? The wife's reaction is emotional, which might indicate that the request is adding pressure. However, the husband's concern is valid\u2014kids can be picky, and he's not used to cooking for them. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the wife is willing to do the prep before leaving, it's a temporary help. But if she's already overwhelmed, maybe the husband should find another solution. However, the husband isn't wrong in wanting to make things easier for himself. He's not forcing her; he's making a request. \n\nThe wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might be dismissive, implying that she doesn't care about the quality of the meals. The husband wants consistency for the kids, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit gray. The husband isn't in the wrong for asking for help, especially since he's taking on her usual chores. The wife might feel that the request is adding to her stress, but the husband's reasoning is about managing the kids' needs. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The request is reasonable given the circumstances, and the wife's reaction is more about the burden on her side rather than the husband's fault.\n"
