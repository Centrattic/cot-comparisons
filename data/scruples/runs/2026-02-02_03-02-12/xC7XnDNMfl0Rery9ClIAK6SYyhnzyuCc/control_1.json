It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nSo the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking. The kids are picky, and he wants her to prep the meals for the week. She's upset and thinks it's too much, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm. The husband is asking for help because he's worried about handling the kids' meals alone. He's not doing it out of laziness but because he wants to avoid meltdowns. He's taking over her half of the chores, so maybe he's already aware of the workload. But she's feeling that the request is unfair or too burdensome. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, considering that she's going on a trip, maybe she's already planning and dealing with packing, etc. Adding meal prep might be an extra she didn't expect. But he's trying to manage his own workload. \n\nIt's a common issue of balancing responsibilities when someone is away. The husband is trying to prepare to handle the kids, which is understandable. But the wife's reaction suggests she feels it's too much to ask, perhaps because she's already stressed about her trip or feels it's unfair given she's leaving.\n\nBut the key points are that the kids are picky, and he's not as experienced with their preferences. So he's trying to prevent problems. However, the wife might feel she's already giving up time to go on her trip, and being asked to prep meals adds stress.\n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about communication and expectations. Did he present the request in a way that considers her feelings? If he didn't consider her workload or stress, maybe he's in the wrong. But if he communicated his need clearly and she still says no, maybe it's a mutual misunderstanding.\n\nHe might not be in the wrong because he's trying to prepare for the situation he'll face. However, he could also be overreaching by expecting her to do work when she's away. The answer might hinge on how reasonable the request is. Meal prepping for a week is a lot, and she might feel it's unreasonable given she's not there to handle it. \n\nAlternatively, since she's going on the trip, maybe she's in a better position to prep before leaving. But if she's already stressed, maybe it's too much. The husband's intention is good, but the wife's feelings are valid. So the answer could be that the husband isn't in the wrong, but the situation requires compromise. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to manage his responsibilities while she's away. But maybe the wife is also right to feel it's too much. However, in terms of AITA, the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer would be B.\n"
