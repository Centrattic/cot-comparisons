      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep for the week while she's away. The husband argues that since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky, he's not as confident in his ability to handle the meals. He wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it gets too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife normally handles the cooking, so it's part of their shared responsibilities. The husband is taking on her chores for the week, which includes cooking. Since he's not as experienced with the kids' preferences, he's asking her to help by prepping the meals in advance. The wife's reaction is that it's too much work, and maybe she's not willing to take on extra labor just before her trip.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to manage the household alone for the first time, which is a big change. He's asking for help to make things easier, especially since the kids are picky. He might feel that it's reasonable for her to prepare the meals before she leaves since she's the primary cook. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the request is unfair because she's already preparing for her trip and now has to do the meal prep as well. She might be feeling overwhelmed or not in the mood for extra work right before her trip.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal expectation here? In many relationships, the idea of shared responsibilities is key. If cooking is her domain, and she's been doing it, then asking her to prep food might be seen as a reasonable request, especially since it's for the kids' well-being. However, if the trip is her time to relax, maybe she feels that the prep work is an added burden she didn't sign up for.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The husband might not have considered that the timing is stressful for her. Maybe she's already busy with packing and other preparations, and the meal prep adds to that stress. The husband's approach might come off as not considering her workload or her need for a break. Instead of asking her to prep, maybe he could have suggested other solutions, like buying pre-made meals or using a meal delivery service.\n\nAlso, their kids are picky, so the husband could be worried about the kids' reactions. But is that a valid reason to make the wife do the prep? It's about the kids' needs versus her needs. However, if the wife is the primary cook, it makes sense that she knows the kids' preferences better. So maybe it's a reasonable request, but the way it was presented might have been off.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The husband is trying to prepare and manage the household, which is understandable. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling that the request is unfair or that her time away is being compromised. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the husband is taking over her usual duties, it's logical that he might need some support to handle them, especially if they're complex (like cooking for picky kids). Meal prepping could be a way to ease the transition. However, if the wife is already stressed about her trip, adding meal prep could be an undue burden. The husband might not have considered her perspective, leading to her upset reaction.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It depends on how the request was made and the underlying assumptions. If he assumed she had to do it without considering her stress or workload, maybe he's not being considerate. But if he's genuinely trying to manage things and knows that she's the best person for the job, then it's a valid request. The problem might be the lack of communication and understanding of her situation. The husband might be in the right in wanting help, but the way he approached it could be the issue. Alternatively, the wife might be in the right if the request is too much.\n\nIn conclusion, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong per se, but there's room for better communication. The question is whether the request itself is reasonable. Since the wife is the primary cook and the husband is taking over, asking her to prep meals could be seen as a reasonable way to ensure the kids' needs are met. However, the wife might feel that the timing is wrong. The answer hinges on whether the request is fair under the circumstances. Since the husband is trying to manage the situation and the wife's refusal is based on workload, perhaps he's not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
