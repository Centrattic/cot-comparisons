It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. So the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prep meals because he's not confident in handling the kids' picky eating alone. The wife got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking a week off, which is her first time away since the kids were born. The husband is handling her chores, including cooking. He's asking for help because he's worried about the kids' reactions to different meals. The wife's response is that meal prepping is too much, but the husband feels it's not unfair since she's taking time off.\n\nIs the husband being reasonable? Well, he's asking her to do something that would make his week easier. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, but it's a one-time effort. The wife's argument is that it's too much work, but maybe she's not considering his stress. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. The husband is not asking for her to do something unreasonable; he's asking her to do something she already does, just in advance. The wife's response seems dismissive, suggesting he just make sandwiches, which might not be practical for picky kids.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is valid because he's preparing for a challenging week. It's common for people to ask a partner to help with such things, especially if they're more skilled in that area. The wife's refusal might be due to the workload, but the husband is just trying to manage the situation better. So, the husband isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
