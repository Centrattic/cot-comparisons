It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The author is asking if they're at fault for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The author is concerned about managing the kids, chores, and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much. He doesn't think it's unfair because she's taking the trip.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the author's request for meal prep to make things easier, the wife's reaction, and the context of the trip being her first time away. Cooking is her responsibility normally, and he can do it but it's harder with the kids. The wife is taking the trip, so he's asking her to do something before leaving.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to plan and asks for help, which is reasonable. The issue is whether the request is unreasonable. Meal prepping for a week might be a lot, but considering the kids' preferences and the added stress of managing alone, maybe it's a valid request. However, the wife might feel pressured, especially if it's already a lot for her to handle. But the author is asking her to do it before her trip, which is her time away. Maybe she doesn't have the capacity to prep in addition to her own travel prep. \n\nThe wife's response was upset, saying it's too much work and suggesting sandwiches instead. That suggests she feels the request is too much. However, the author's reasoning is about managing the kids' needs and reducing his own stress. It's a balance between practicality and considering her capabilities. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to plan and asks for help that's reasonable given the circumstances. The wife's reaction might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the request itself isn't unjust. So the answer is B.\n"
