It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife is going on a week-long trip, and he's asking her to meal prep for the kids during her absence. She got upset and refused, suggesting he could just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so the husband is taking on her share of responsibilities. Cooking is her usual role, and the kids are picky eaters. The husband wants to avoid meltdowns by having familiar meals prepped. He's asking her to do this because he's already handling her chores and work, which might be overwhelming. \n\nThe wife might feel that meal prepping for a week is too much additional work, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. She might also feel that the request is a bit much since she's leaving, and perhaps she wants to focus on her own preparations. Her response of \"just make sandwiches\" could be a way to set boundaries, as she might not feel it's fair to ask her to take on more when she's already managing her own travel plans.\n\nBut from the husband's perspective, he's trying to plan ahead to manage the added stress. He's not asking her to do anything unreasonable, just a week's worth of meals that the kids are used to. He might feel that since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, it's logical for her to handle it, especially since she's going to be away and has the time to prepare before leaving.\n\nI need to think about fairness and communication. Is the husband overstepping by asking for meal prep? Or is he simply trying to coordinate responsibilities? The wife's reaction suggests that she might feel the request is too much, which could imply that the husband didn't consider her workload or feelings. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or found a compromise. However, his intention is to make things easier for everyone, including the kids.\n\nAnother angle is the division of labor in their household. If cooking is typically her responsibility, then expecting her to prep for the week could be seen as reasonable, especially since she's the one who knows the kids best. But if she's already handling her trip's preparations, maybe the request is adding to her stress. It's possible that the husband didn't consider that she might have enough to do, so he's not considering her perspective.\n\nIn AITA posts, the key is often about how the request is framed and whether it's reasonable. The husband is asking for something that would make his week easier, but if the wife feels it's too much, then there's a disconnect in expectations. Maybe the husband should have offered to do it himself or asked if there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. Alternatively, the wife could have communicated her workload earlier.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It depends on whether the request is reasonable. Since the wife is leaving, she might have her own tasks, and the husband's request could be adding to her burden. If he didn't consider that she might be overwhelmed, then he might be in the wrong. But if he genuinely thought it was a helpful and fair request given the circumstances, then maybe not. The key is whether the request is excessive or if there was a lack of communication.\n"
