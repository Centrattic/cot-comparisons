      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's wife is going on a week-long trip, which is the first time she's been away from the kids since they were born. The author is concerned about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife usually handles cooking. He asked her to meal prep for the week so he doesn't have to deal with the stress of cooking, but she got upset and said it's too much work and suggested just making sandwiches instead.\n\nThe author feels that it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals since she's going on the trip. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the wife is going on a trip, which is a time when she's not around to do her usual share of the cooking. The author is trying to prepare to manage without her, which makes sense. He's asking her to do something (meal prep) that would make the week easier for him. But she's upset because it's too much work. \n\nIs the author overstepping by asking her to prep meals? Well, he's not asking her to do something during her trip; he's asking her to do it before she leaves. That seems fair because she's the one who's going away, so she's available before the trip. However, maybe she has her own reasons for not wanting to prep. For example, maybe she's already busy with packing, or she feels that the author should be able to handle the cooking himself, even if it's a challenge. \n\nThe author mentions that the kids are picky and his wife knows their preferences better. That's a valid point; if the kids don't get their usual meals, there could be meltdowns. So the author's concern is about maintaining stability for the kids. But does that justify asking his wife to prep? Maybe it's a reasonable request given the circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is assuming that the wife should be responsible for this task just because she's the usual cook. Maybe the wife expects the author to step up and learn the kids' preferences, which would be a fair point. If the wife is upset because he's not willing to take on that responsibility, then maybe there's an underlying issue about sharing responsibilities. But the author is asking her to help in advance, which could be seen as a way to share the load. \n\nAnother angle: the wife is going on a trip, which is a self-care or work-related activity. Should she be expected to take on extra work before the trip to make things easier for the husband? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author isn't offering to help with other tasks, maybe that could be a problem, but the question is specifically about the meal prep. \n\nThe author isn't asking for something unreasonable\u2014meal prep is a common way people help others. But the wife might feel it's too much, especially if she's already busy. The author might not realize the effort involved in meal prepping for a week, especially for picky kids. Alternatively, the wife might feel that the author isn't trying hard enough to manage on his own. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to prevent potential meltdowns, which is a valid concern. The wife's refusal might stem from not wanting to add more work before her trip. But since she's going away, the prep needs to be done before she leaves. So maybe the author is in the right by asking, and the wife is overreacting. But maybe the author isn't considering that the wife might have her own limitations or that the author should be stepping up more instead of relying on her to prep. \n\nI think the key here is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, but since it's before the trip, it's a valid ask. The wife's response (\"if it gets too hard you can make sandwiches\") might be dismissive of the author's concerns. The author is trying to avoid a stressful situation, so his request is understandable. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she might feel the request is unfair, perhaps because she's already handling a lot or doesn't want to take on extra tasks before her trip. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. His request is reasonable given the circumstances, and he's trying to manage a stressful situation for the family. The wife's refusal might be due to her own stress or underestimating the author's ability to handle the cooking, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for asking. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
