It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The scenario is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling cooking for the kids by himself. He asked her to pre-make dinners, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He feels it's fair to ask because she's the one who normally cooks, and he's concerned about the kids being picky.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The husband's perspective: he's stepping in for the first time to manage all the chores and cooking. He's not confident in handling the kids' specific food preferences, which he attributes to his wife's experience. He's asking her to help by prepping meals to ease his burden. On the flip side, the wife is upset because she's already taking a trip, which is a time away from the kids, and she might feel that the husband isn't trusting her to handle the trip or that he's overstepping by expecting her to do extra prep work on top of her trip preparations.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, it's a common situation where couples divide responsibilities. The husband is asking for help, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. However, the wife's reaction might indicate that she's already stressed about the trip or feels the request is unfair. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's request is practical, but he might not have considered her feelings or the additional stress of prepping meals before her trip. Alternatively, the wife might need to express her concerns more clearly if the prep is truly unmanageable.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Since the husband is asking for something that would make the week easier for him and the wife's normal role is cooking, it's not inherently unfair. However, the wife's reaction suggests there might be underlying issues in their communication or expectations. The husband could have been more considerate of her workload, but the request itself isn't necessarily wrong. So, in terms of being in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because the husband's request is understandable and not an unfair burden given the circumstances. The wife's refusal might stem from stress or other factors, but that doesn't make the husband wrong for asking.\n"
