I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the week because he's worried about handling the kids and cooking by himself. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is that cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he's not confident he can handle it alone. He's taking on her chores for the week, so he's asking her to help by prepping meals before she leaves. He thinks it's fair because she's the one going away, so she should help to make his task easier.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is upset because meal prepping for a week is a lot of work, maybe time-consuming or tiring. She might feel that it's reasonable to expect him to handle the cooking on his own, especially since he's capable of doing it. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip or feels that the husband should adjust his expectations. She's also suggesting an alternative (sandwiches), which might be simpler.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and communication. The husband is trying to set himself up for success by asking for help, but the wife feels it's too much. Was it wrong to ask? Well, he's not forcing her; he's making a request. But maybe he didn't consider her workload or feelings. The wife might feel that he's not taking responsibility, especially if he's capable of cooking. But he's also under a lot of stress with the kids and work.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance responsibilities and understand each other's limitations. The husband's intention is to avoid problems with the kids, which is valid, but the wife's reaction suggests she feels the request is unreasonable. Whether he's wrong depends on whether the request was excessive or if there was a lack of communication about expectations.\n\nI think both sides have valid points. The husband is trying to be proactive, but maybe he should have discussed it earlier and considered her perspective. However, asking her to prepare meals before her trip isn't necessarily wrong. The wife's reaction is a bit harsh if the request is reasonable. So, I'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong, but maybe the communication could be better. The answer would be B (No).\n"
