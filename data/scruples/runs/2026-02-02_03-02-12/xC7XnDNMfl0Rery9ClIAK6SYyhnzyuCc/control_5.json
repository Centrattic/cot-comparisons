It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband wants the wife to prepare meals for the week because he's not confident in his ability to cook for the picky kids. He's taking over her chores during her absence. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and told him to make sandwiches if needed.\n\nI should consider the fairness of the request. The husband is asking for help to manage without her, which is reasonable. The wife is going on a trip, so she's aware of the timing. However, maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the additional work. But the husband's reasoning is that he's not as skilled in cooking as her, and the kids are used to her meals. If he can't handle it, maybe the sandwiches are a fallback, but he's worried about kids' reactions.\n\nIs it unfair to ask her to prep meals? Well, since she's the one who normally does the cooking, maybe it's logical to ask her to plan ahead. But she's going away, so maybe she doesn't have the time or capacity. However, preparing meals in advance could save the husband time and stress. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe wife's response might be a bit dismissive, saying \"just make sandwiches\" which could minimize his concerns. The husband's request is based on his need for support, not being lazy. So, maybe the wife isn't wrong in feeling it's too much, but the husband isn't in the wrong for asking. It's a matter of communication and finding a middle ground. The husband isn't wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities, and the wife's refusal is her choice, but the husband's request is valid.\n"
