It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. So the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prepare dinners for the week because he's not confident in handling it alone, especially with the kids being picky. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches. The husband is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is taking on additional responsibilities during her absence. Normally, the wife handles cooking, which is a big part of their routine. He's asking her to prep meals as a way to ease his burden. The wife's response was negative, feeling it's too much work. The question is whether the husband's request is reasonable.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's anticipating potential problems (kids having meltdowns over unfamiliar food) and trying to prevent them. He's justified in thinking that the wife's knowledge of the kids' preferences makes her the better choice for meal prep. Also, since she's the one going on the trip, maybe he's considering that she's the one who can do the prep before leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding more stress before her trip. She might already be dealing with the logistics of her travel, and meal prepping could be seen as an extra burden. It's possible she feels unappreciated or that her workload isn't being considered. The husband is asking her to do work that's not part of her trip planning but for someone else's benefit, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe husband isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to ensure things run smoothly while he's handling everything. But maybe he didn't consider her stress levels or the time and effort required for meal prepping. A middle ground could be discussing how they can split the workload, but he's asking her to do all of it. It might be a communication issue rather than a right or wrong situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife was already taking on cooking duties, asking her to prep meals before her trip isn't unreasonable. But if she's already overwhelmed, maybe the request isn't fair. The key is that the husband's intention is to manage the situation better, but he's not considering her perspective fully. Still, in most cases, partners are expected to support each other in household responsibilities, so the request might be reasonable. The wife's response of suggesting just sandwiches might not be helpful, but the husband's request isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's trying to plan ahead and is not overstepping by asking his wife to help, especially since it's her expertise. The wife's reaction might be valid for her stress, but the husband's request is justified.\n"
