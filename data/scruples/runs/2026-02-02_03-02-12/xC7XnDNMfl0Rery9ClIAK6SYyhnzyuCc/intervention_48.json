It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep for the kids during that time. He's managing alone with the kids and work, and since cooking is her responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better, he asked her to prep meals. She got upset, thinking it's too much, and suggested he can just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: he's asking for help because he's overwhelmed with taking over all the chores and work. He needs consistency for the kids, especially since they're picky. Meal prepping would make his life easier and avoid meltdowns from unfamiliar food.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that meal prepping is an extra burden, especially since she's already going on a trip. Maybe she's stressed about her trip or feels it's unfair to expect her to do more work before leaving. The husband is asking her to take on more work right before her trip, which could add stress. But the husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband is trying to manage a challenging week alone and is seeking support from his wife. However, the wife's reaction suggests she might feel the request is unreasonable. It's possible there's a lack of understanding about how much effort meal prepping would take, or maybe she's not aware of how difficult the week will be for him.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? He's asking for help in a practical way, but he might not have considered how the request affects his wife. Maybe he should have discussed alternatives or considered her workload. But given that meal prepping is part of her usual responsibilities, and she knows the kids' preferences, it's understandable he'd ask. The wife's refusal might stem from feeling overwhelmed, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to make things easier.\n\nIn relationships, these situations often depend on how both parties communicate and support each other. The husband's intent is to reduce stress for himself and the kids, which is valid. But he might need to find a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or maybe the wife can do some prep without the whole week's load. However, based on the information given, the husband isn't in the wrong for making a reasonable request to manage his responsibilities during her absence.\n"
