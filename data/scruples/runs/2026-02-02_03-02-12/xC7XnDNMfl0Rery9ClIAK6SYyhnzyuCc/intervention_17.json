It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking by himself, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said that's too much work and suggested he can make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's taking over all her responsibilities for a week, which is a big task. Cooking isn't his usual role, and the kids are picky. Meal prepping would ease his burden. He's trying to plan ahead to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. It's reasonable to ask for help, especially since she's the one leaving and has the knowledge about the kids' preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals is an additional task on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she has her own things to manage, and she's already stressed about being away. Her response that she can't do it and suggests sandwiches might be her way of setting boundaries or indicating that she's overwhelmed.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? He's asking for help in a situation where he's shouldering more responsibility. It's not unreasonable to plan ahead. However, he could have considered other ways to manage, like involving the kids in meal choices or using simpler recipes. Maybe the wife felt it was an added pressure she wasn't expecting. Still, his request seems practical. There's no indication he's being unfair, just trying to make things manageable. The wife's reaction is valid, but the husband's request isn't in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
