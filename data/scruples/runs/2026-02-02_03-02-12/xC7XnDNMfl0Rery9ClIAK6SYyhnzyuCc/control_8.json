It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep for the week she's away so he can handle the kids and chores alone. The wife got upset because she thinks it's too much work.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: he's not used to cooking for the kids because they're picky, and his wife knows their preferences better. He's worried about meltdowns if the food isn't right. The wife is going on a trip, which is a big change for the family.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help preparing meals, which is a reasonable request, especially since it's the first time she's been away. But the wife feels it's too much. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, or maybe she's not used to being asked to do that extra work. However, since she's the one leaving, it's logical to think she's the one who can prep before she goes. The husband is being practical, trying to minimize disruption. \n\nBut does he have a valid point? He's not making her do it during her trip; he's asking her to do it before she leaves. The wife's reaction might be about the effort involved, but it's a one-time thing. However, maybe she's not in a position to do that, perhaps due to her own preparations. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer likely depends on whether the request is reasonable. Since the wife is going away, it's her time to prepare what she can. The husband is trying to be proactive. The wife's response is dismissive, suggesting that the author's request is not unreasonable. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
