She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to meal prep for the week while she's away on a trip. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work, and the author feels it's fair since she's the one who's going away.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's wife is going on a trip, and he'll be handling all the chores and cooking alone for the first time. Cooking is her responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week to make it easier for him. She got upset and said it's too much, suggesting he can just make sandwiches instead. The author doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food and thinks it's fair to ask her to prep since she's the one leaving.\n\nNow, considering fairness and expectations in a relationship. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, and asking someone to do it when they're about to leave might be a lot. However, the author is in a tough situation\u2014handling all the chores plus cooking for picky kids. He's not asking her to come back or do it during her trip, just to prepare before she leaves. His intention is to reduce his stress and ensure the kids eat well. \n\nBut why did she get upset? Maybe she feels it's unfair to add more work before her trip, especially if she's already preparing for it. Or perhaps she's overwhelmed with her own plans and doesn't want the extra responsibility. It's possible the author didn't consider how much time meal prep would take for her, leading to her frustration. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the request was reasonable and he communicated it early, maybe not. But if the request is excessive or not discussed properly, it could be seen as adding pressure. However, since this is the first time he's handling everything alone, seeking support makes sense. The answer probably hinges on whether the request was reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's asking for help to manage a challenging week. However, he should have considered his wife's perspective and maybe offered to assist with the prep or adjust the request if it's too much. But the core issue is about fairness in shared responsibilities. Since the wife is the one going away, asking her to prepare in advance isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
