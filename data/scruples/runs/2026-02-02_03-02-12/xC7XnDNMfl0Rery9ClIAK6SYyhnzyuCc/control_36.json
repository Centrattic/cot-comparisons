It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work. He feels it's not unfair since she's taking the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable because he's worried about managing everything alone. Cooking for picky kids is challenging, and the wife knows their preferences better. Meal prepping could help him avoid stress during the week. However, the wife's reaction is important too. If she's already stressed about the trip or the prep work, maybe her feelings are valid. But the husband's request is for support to make his week easier, which is understandable.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? The key points are communication and mutual support. If he communicated his needs respectfully and she felt it was too much, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But he's asking for help before she leaves, which is logical. She's taking a break, so it's reasonable to expect some preparation. However, if she's already overwhelmed, maybe the request is too much. But the husband isn't asking her to do the entire week's cooking while away; just prep before she goes. That seems fair. The wife's response might be a bit harsh, but both sides want the kids to eat well. The husband isn't wrong for asking for help. So the answer is B.\n"
