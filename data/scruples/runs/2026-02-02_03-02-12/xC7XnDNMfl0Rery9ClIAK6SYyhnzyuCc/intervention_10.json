It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to pre-make meals before she goes on a week-long trip. He's worried about handling the kids and chores alone, especially since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky. She's upset because she thinks it's too much work and suggests he just make sandwiches instead. The husband feels it's fair to ask her to prep meals since she's going to be away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is trying to plan ahead to manage the household alone. Cooking for picky kids is a challenge, and he's asking his wife to help by prepping meals. That seems reasonable because she knows their preferences better. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip preparations. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the separation from the kids. She might also feel that the husband isn't taking enough initiative to manage on his own, which could lead to resentment.\n\nThe husband's intention is to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable, just to pre-make meals for the week. Since she's the one going on the trip, he's asking her to handle the part she's responsible for before leaving. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might be dismissive, but maybe she's overwhelmed. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? It depends on their usual dynamic. If cooking is her responsibility and he's taking over the rest, then asking her to handle the meal prep before her trip makes sense. However, if she's already handling a lot, maybe the husband should take on more responsibility himself. But in this case, he's asking for help, not imposing a burden. The key point is that he's trying to make it easier for himself, not being lazy. \n\nThe wife's reaction is about the workload. She might feel that the request is excessive. However, the husband is not asking her to do something dangerous or unreasonable; it's just meal prep. If she can manage it, then it's a reasonable request. If she can't, maybe they need to compromise. But her getting really upset suggests she feels the request is unfair. \n\nIn the end, the husband is trying to plan ahead for the week. He's not in the wrong for asking her to do something she's responsible for. The wife's reaction might be valid if she's overburdened, but the husband's request isn't unreasonable. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
