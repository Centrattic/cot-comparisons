It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the kids during her week-long trip so he can handle things alone. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work, and the husband feels it's fair to ask.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so it's a big change. The husband is taking on more responsibilities, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with. He's asking her to prep meals to avoid issues with the kids, who are picky. The wife's response is that it's too much work and suggests sandwiches instead.\n\nI should think about fairness and communication. The husband's request is practical, given his inexperience in cooking and the kids' preferences. Meal prepping isn't unusual for someone going away, especially to help a partner. But the wife might feel overwhelmed, especially if she's preparing for a trip already. There's a possibility she's dealing with her own stress about being away from the kids and not wanting to take on extra work before the trip.\n\nIs it unfair to ask her? The husband is asking her to do something for the household while she's preparing to leave. If she's already busy packing and getting ready, adding meal prep might be too much. However, the husband's reasoning is valid: he wants to avoid problems with the kids. It's a balance between mutual support and manageable requests.\n\nCommunication is key here. The husband's approach might have been too direct without considering her current workload. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or offered to help with some prep. The wife's frustration could also stem from feeling that her own needs or stress aren't being considered. She might feel it's unrealistic to expect her to handle that last-minute.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. His intention is to manage the household better, but he might not have considered her perspective enough. The wife's reaction is valid if she's already stressed about the trip. However, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong; he's trying to be proactive. The issue here might be more about how the request was made and whether they both discussed their needs and limitations beforehand. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I have to decide if his request crosses a line. I think the answer leans towards No because the request is reasonable, but there's room for better communication. So the answer is B.\n"
