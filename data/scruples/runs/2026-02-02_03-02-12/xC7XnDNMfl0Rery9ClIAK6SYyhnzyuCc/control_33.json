It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. He asked her to prep dinners because he's not as confident in his cooking, especially with the kids being picky. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's trying to prepare for a challenging week. His wife knows the kids' preferences better, so prepping meals would reduce stress for him. On the other hand, the wife is on a trip and might be dealing with her own schedule or stress. She might feel that meal prepping isn't her responsibility anymore since she's not at home, or maybe she's overwhelmed with her trip preparations.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's going to be away, so it's her choice whether she wants to take on that task. If she's already planning the trip, adding meal prep could add more work. The husband might not realize how much time meal prepping would take or that she might have other things to do. Alternatively, maybe she's not comfortable cooking in advance, or perhaps she's used to relying on the husband to handle meals even when she's away.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's request is reasonable if they usually split responsibilities and meal prep is part of her role. However, the wife might feel that she's already taking a break from responsibilities by going on a trip, so being asked to prep meals could feel like an extra burden. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her perspective or how the request might affect her trip preparations.\n\nAlso, the wife's response, suggesting sandwiches, might indicate she doesn't see the need for prepping or that she's concerned about the effort. The husband's main concern is avoiding meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or the husband trying to adjust his cooking. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for making the request.\n\nI think the husband's intention is good\u2014he's trying to manage the household during her absence. But the wife's refusal could be valid if she's overburdened. It's about whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since she's on a trip, maybe it's unfair to expect her to take on extra work that she's not required to do. Or maybe it's fair if meal prep was part of her usual responsibilities. Without more context, it's tricky, but the fact that she got upset suggests there's an imbalance or unspoken expectations.\n\nI would lean towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's trying to manage a stressful situation. However, he should have considered her perspective better. The wife might also be overreacting if meal prep is part of her usual role. Alternatively, the husband could be assuming responsibility without realizing the impact on her. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because his request is practical, but he could have communicated better. However, the wife's right to not want to do it is also valid. Ultimately, it's a situation where both sides have valid points, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife is on a trip and the request adds work for her, maybe it's a B. Or A if the request is unfair. Hmm.\n"
