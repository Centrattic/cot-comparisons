It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores alone while she's away. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's wife is going on her first trip away from the kids, so the author is taking over all her responsibilities. Cooking is usually her job, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The author wants her to prep meals to avoid issues with picky eaters and meltdowns. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much to ask, maybe because she's busy with her trip prep or doesn't want the extra work.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to plan ahead to manage the workload. It's reasonable to ask for help, especially since she's the one who normally does the cooking. But maybe the wife feels it's unfair because she's already dealing with her own trip preparations. Or maybe she feels resentful about taking on extra work when she's not around. The author's request is practical, but the wife's reaction shows that she's not comfortable with it. \n\nIs the author being selfish? He's not trying to avoid work, just to make it manageable. The wife's refusal might stem from feeling overwhelmed or not wanting to take on more. However, the author's request is within reason, given his need to manage the kids. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author should have considered that the wife might be stressed about the trip and adding meal prep is too much. But the author's reasoning is valid too. \n\nI think the key points are mutual responsibility and communication. If the author and wife had discussed their expectations before, maybe there wouldn't be an issue. The author's request is practical, but the wife's feelings need to be respected. However, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, especially since he's taking on her usual responsibilities. The wife's reaction is valid too, but the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer is B, no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
