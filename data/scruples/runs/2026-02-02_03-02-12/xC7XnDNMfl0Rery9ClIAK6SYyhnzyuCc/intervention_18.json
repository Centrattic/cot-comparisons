It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me think about this. The wife is going away for a week, which is her first time being away from the kids since they were born. The author is concerned about handling all the chores and cooking, which their wife usually does. The kids are picky, and the author isn't as comfortable cooking for them. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested making sandwiches. The author feels it's reasonable because the wife is taking a full week off.\n\nHmm. First, the author's request seems practical. They're trying to manage the week alone, so meal prepping could make things easier. But the wife might feel that preparing meals for an entire week is an additional burden, especially if she's already busy with her trip preparations. Maybe the author didn't consider her stress or workload before the trip. But the author's reasoning is about avoiding meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. That makes sense because picky eating can be stressful for kids and the parent left in charge.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction might indicate that the request was too much. The key here is communication. Did the author ask kindly and consider her possible workload? If so, and the wife still refused, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author didn't take into account her existing commitments, maybe that's where they went wrong. Also, suggesting that she can do sandwiches if it's too hard might not be a helpful solution. The author should perhaps find a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or adjusting their expectations. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making the request. I don't think so. They're asking for help to manage a challenging situation. The wife's reaction is valid, but the author's request isn't unreasonable. So answer B.\n"
