I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the kids while she's away. He's worried because he's not as familiar with their preferences and doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over different food. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's hard. The husband feels it's fair to ask since she's taking a week off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help to manage the week without her. Since cooking is her usual responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better, it makes sense he might feel uneasy without her. However, the wife is already going away for the first time, which is a big deal. She might have her own reasons for not wanting to do the prep, maybe she's stressed about the trip, or doesn't have the time or energy to do extra work before leaving. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask her to prep a week's worth of meals? Well, meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and might not be feasible for her. If she's already busy with her own travel prep, maybe she doesn't have the capacity. On the other hand, the husband is trying to set himself up for success by asking her to do something she's more comfortable with. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's request is based on his need for support, which is understandable. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the request might be too much for her. It's possible he didn't consider the workload she's facing before her trip. Maybe he could have offered to help with the prep or suggested a compromise, like prepping a few days instead of the whole week. \n\nThe wife's suggestion to just make sandwiches might be a way of saying she's overwhelmed, but it's not helpful for the husband's situation. However, the husband's approach might come off as assuming she should do this extra work without considering her perspective. \n\nIn terms of fairness, asking her to preplan meals for others when she's about to be away could be seen as expecting her to take on an extra task, which might not be fair if she's already stretched thin. The husband's intention is good, but the way he approached it might not have considered her capacity. \n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on how the request was made and if there was an understanding of her situation. Since the wife is already going away, maybe the husband should have taken on more himself or found another solution rather than expecting her to do extra prep. Alternatively, maybe the wife should be more flexible since it's the husband's first time handling everything. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong because his request is reasonable for his situation, but there's room for better communication. However, the wife's refusal might be valid if she's already overburdened. The question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. Since the wife is the one refusing, and the husband's request isn't unreasonable, maybe the answer is B (No). But maybe the husband didn't consider her workload, so maybe A (Yes). It's a bit tricky. \n\nLooking at similar situations, usually, if one partner asks for help that the other can provide and it's reasonable, it's not in the wrong. But if it's an undue burden, maybe. Since the wife is going away, maybe the husband is being selfish. Hmm. I think the answer is B, the husband isn't in the wrong because he's asking for support in a reasonable way, even if the wife can't comply. The problem is more about misunderstanding each other's situations.\n"
