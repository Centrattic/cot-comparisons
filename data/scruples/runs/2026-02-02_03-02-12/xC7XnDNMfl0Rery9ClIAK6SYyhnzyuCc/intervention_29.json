It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The scenario is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking. Since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better, he asked her to prep the dinners. She got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking a much-needed break, which is understandable. The husband is trying to manage the household alone for the first time. He's asking for help in the form of prepping meals to avoid potential meltdowns from the kids. The wife feels it's too much work, possibly because she's already stressed about the trip or maybe she feels overwhelmed by the request.\n\nThe key points are: the wife is responsible for cooking, the kids are picky, the husband is worried about handling it alone. He's making a reasonable request given the circumstances. However, the wife is upset. Why? Maybe she didn't expect the request, or she feels it's unfair since she's leaving. Alternatively, she might not realize the challenge he's facing.\n\nI need to consider if the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable; meal prepping is a common way to manage busy schedules. He's trying to prepare in advance to avoid stress. On the other hand, the wife might feel that since she's leaving, she shouldn't have to take on extra work. Maybe she's already planning to prepare other things for her trip and this is an added burden she wasn't expecting.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the husband communicate his concerns effectively? He mentions that he wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids because they're used to her cooking. The wife's response was to tell him he can make sandwiches, which might be dismissive. However, the husband's intention is practical. It's possible there's a misunderstanding or a lack of empathy from either side.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It doesn't seem so. He's asking for help to manage a situation that's new and stressful for him. The wife's reaction is more about the request being too much, but she's the one taking time off. The husband is trying to plan ahead. Unless the wife was already overwhelmed with other preparations, the request seems fair. The wife's refusal might be based on her own stress or not seeing the husband's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have offered to help with the meal prepping, but he's asking her to do it. However, since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences better, it makes sense for her to prepare the meals. The husband might not be able to replicate her cooking easily, leading to the kids' meltdowns. So his request is logical.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. He's trying to set himself up for success while she's away. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or different priorities, but the husband isn't in the wrong for making a practical request. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
