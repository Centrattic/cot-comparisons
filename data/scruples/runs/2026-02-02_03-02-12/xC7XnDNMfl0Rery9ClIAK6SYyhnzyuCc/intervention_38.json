      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. So the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried because he has to handle all the chores and cooking alone, which is usually the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better, so he wants her to prep dinners for the week. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he can just make sandwiches if needed. The author thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: he's asking the wife to prep meals because he's concerned about handling the cooking alone, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. It's a practical request to make things easier for him during the week. The wife's response is that it's too much work and offers an alternative (sandwiches), but maybe she's overwhelmed or feels it's unfair given she's already going on a trip. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it reasonable to ask someone to prep meals before a trip? The wife is going away, so maybe it's a fair request since she's not there to cook. However, meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and might not be feasible for her. The husband's request is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. But the wife might feel that she's already giving up her time by being away, and the prep work adds extra stress. \n\nAnother point: the wife is leaving for a week, which is a significant time away. The husband is asking for help before she leaves, which is logical. However, the wife's response might indicate that she's either not willing or able to do the prep. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The husband's approach might come across as demanding, especially if he didn't consider her workload or feelings. He might have assumed she could do it without realizing how much work it is. \n\nIs there a middle ground? For example, maybe prepping some meals instead of all, or the husband can handle some meals if he's okay with the kids being flexible. The wife's suggestion of sandwiches is a compromise, but the husband is concerned about the kids' reactions to unfamiliar food. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's reasonable to ask a partner to help out with tasks they normally handle, especially when they're going away. However, the wife might have her own reasons for not wanting to prep. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her perspective or the effort required. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), usually, the determination is based on whether the person's actions are unreasonable. The husband's request seems practical but might be seen as overstepping if the wife is already stressed or if the prep work is too much. However, since he's asking her to do something she's already responsible for when she's there, it's a reasonable request. The wife's refusal could be valid if the prep is too burdensome, but the husband's position is also valid. \n\nI think the key here is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a lot, but if that's what the husband needs, and the wife is capable, then it's not unreasonable. However, if the wife is already busy or stressed, the husband might need to be more understanding. Since the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, I have to consider if his request is unfair. Given that he's asking for help in an area where the wife is more skilled, and it's a one-time request before her trip, I would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here because it depends on their usual dynamics. If the wife usually handles all the cooking and the husband is now asking her to do the prep, it's a fair request. However, if the wife is already overburdened, maybe it's not. But based on the information given, the husband's reasoning is valid, so B is the answer.\n"
