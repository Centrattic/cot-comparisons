It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation involves the wife going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling the cooking and chores alone, especially since the kids are picky and his wife knows their preferences better.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that since the wife is going away, it's fair to ask her to prep meals beforehand to make his week easier. The wife, however, feels that this is too much work and suggests making sandwiches if needed. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to verify.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, but it's a one-time effort before the trip. The husband's concern about the kids' meltdowns over unfamiliar food is valid. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra stress before her trip. \n\nIs there a balance here? The husband isn't asking her to do the entire trip's meals, just to prep dinners for the week she's away. But maybe the wife feels it's too much, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. The key is whether the request is fair given the circumstances.\n\nThe husband is taking over her usual chores, so asking her to handle the cooking one last time might be seen as reasonable. However, the wife might feel that since she's going away, the responsibility should shift more to him. The conflict here is about expectations and communication. Maybe the husband didn't consider that the wife might be overwhelmed with her own preparations, making the meal prep an added burden.\n\nIt's possible that the husband's request is fair, but the way he framed it might have caused the wife to feel pressured. The answer hinges on whether the request is realistic and if they had a good discussion about it. Since the wife is the one who normally handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences, it makes sense she's the one to prep. However, if she's already stressed about her trip, maybe the husband should have offered alternative solutions instead of just asking her to prep.\n\nIn the end, the husband's intention is to make things easier, which seems reasonable. The wife's refusal might be due to her own stress. The husband isn't necessarily wrong, but maybe the communication could have been better. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
