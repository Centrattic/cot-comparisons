It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the author is worried about handling cooking for the kids, who are picky. He asks her to prep dinners, but she's upset and thinks it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's taking over a lot of responsibilities, including chores and cooking, which he's not as comfortable with. He wants the meal prep to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. He feels it's fair to ask her to do this since she's going to be away.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is upset. Maybe she feels like she's being asked to do extra work right before her trip. Maybe she's already packed or stressed about the trip, and adding meal prep is too much. It could be that she feels her needs aren't being considered, or perhaps she thinks the author should handle it himself or that the kids can cope with simpler meals like sandwiches.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide that, I need to assess if his request is unreasonable. The key points are: he's new to handling cooking, the kids are picky, and meal prep would help. But is it fair to ask her to do that as she's leaving?\n\nPossible factors: Did they have prior discussions about responsibilities? Maybe they didn't plan for this situation before the trip. If the wife usually does all the cooking, maybe it's reasonable to ask for some help. However, if she feels it's an unfair request, especially if she's already preparing for her trip, then maybe the author didn't consider her perspective.\n\nAlso, the wife's response seems a bit dismissive, telling him to make sandwiches. That might indicate she's not open to compromise. But the author's intention is to avoid meltdowns, which is valid. The wife might not realize how challenging it is for him, or maybe she underestimates his situation.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author asked in a respectful way and the wife refused, maybe the issue is more about communication. The author isn't in the wrong if his request is reasonable and he's trying to manage the situation. But if the request is adding too much to her already packed schedule, maybe he should have found another solution.\n\nBut since the author is asking if he's in the wrong, it's about the fairness of the request. I think he's not in the wrong because the request is practical. However, maybe there's a middle ground that wasn't discussed. But based on the information, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
