It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The author's wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling all the chores and cooking for the kids, especially since they're picky. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair to ask since she's taking a week off.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking over her chores, and since the kids are picky, meal prepping would make it easier for him. He's not unreasonable; he's trying to prepare. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is a form of self-care or a break. She might feel that being asked to prep meals negates the purpose of her trip, adding stress. Maybe she's already stressed about leaving the kids and the workload, so the extra request feels like an added burden.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the wife is the one who knows the kids' preferences better. So he's right that she's the better person to handle the meal prep. But maybe she's worried about the time it takes to prep a week's worth of meals. Is it reasonable to expect that? If the author is asking for a week's worth of meals, that might be a lot. However, considering her trip is a week, perhaps she could have planned this in advance. But maybe she didn't, and the author is bringing it up last minute.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to manage responsibilities during her absence. It's logical for him to ask for help, especially since the kids are used to her cooking. But the wife feels it's too much. Maybe they didn't discuss the division of labor properly before she left. Is the author being selfish by expecting her to do the prep when she's already gone? Or is he being practical?\n\nI think the key here is communication. If the author had a conversation with his wife beforehand to plan how the meals would be handled during her trip, maybe they could have found a solution together. But since he only asked when she was already packing, that might have come as a surprise. The wife's reaction could be due to feeling overwhelmed at the last minute. However, the author's intention is good; he's trying to make things easier for himself and avoid meltdowns with the kids.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not wrong for wanting to prepare. The wife is also not wrong for feeling it's too much. It's a situation where they need to compromise. Maybe the author could have asked earlier or offered to help with the prep. But based on the information given, I don't think the author is in the wrong. He's acting in the best interest of the kids and the household. The answer should be B.\n"
