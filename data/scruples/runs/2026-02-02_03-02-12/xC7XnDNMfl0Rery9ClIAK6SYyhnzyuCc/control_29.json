It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is asking his wife to meal prep before she goes on a week-long trip. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: He's taking over her responsibilities, like cooking, which he's not as familiar with because their kids are picky. He's worried about handling meals alone for the first time, so he asks her to prep. She says it's too much and suggests sandwiches instead. He thinks it's fair to ask since she's the one going away. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to determine if his request is reasonable. On one hand, he's trying to prepare for a big change in routine, and meal prepping could help. The wife might be overwhelmed with her trip, though. But she has a week to prepare before leaving. Is it fair to expect her to do that? The wife's reaction is strong\u2014getting upset and dismissing his concerns. The husband is trying to avoid potential problems with the kids not liking the food. \n\nThe user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer. So, factors to consider: Is the husband's request reasonable? Could there be a middle ground? The wife could do some prep but maybe not all. The husband's concern is valid, but maybe he should have discussed it earlier. However, he did ask, and she refused. The wife's responsibility for cooking is established, so asking her to prep before leaving might not be unreasonable. The key is whether the husband is overstepping or not. Since he's the one taking over, ensuring meals are manageable makes sense. The wife's refusal might be due to the prep being too much, but it's her trip, so perhaps she needs to accommodate. On the other hand, expecting her to preplan all meals might be a lot. But the husband isn't asking her to cook while she's away; just to prep before leaving. So, B (not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable, and the wife's refusal is not justified. However, maybe the husband didn't consider her workload or offered alternatives. But the wife's response seems dismissive. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B because the husband is trying to manage the situation, and the wife's refusal is the issue. Alternatively, maybe A because he didn't consider her workload. But the wife's trip is her own choice. So, B seems more likely.\n"
