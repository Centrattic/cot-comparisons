It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that he's going to be alone with the kids for a week and wants her to prepare meals since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky. She got upset and said it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking over her chores, and since she knows the kids' food preferences better, prepping meals would help avoid meltdowns. He's asking her to do this because he's not as experienced, which makes sense. On the flip side, the wife might feel it's unfair to expect her to do extra work before a trip, especially if she's already preparing for it. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or has other things to do.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's going to be gone for a week, so maybe she has time to do it. But if she feels it's too much, that's her perspective. The key here is whether the request was reasonable. The author is trying to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" seems dismissive. But maybe she's overburdened. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is being selfish or if he's trying to manage a difficult situation. Since the kids are picky and the author isn't as familiar with their preferences, asking for prepped meals isn't unreasonable. The wife's refusal could be due to stress or not wanting to take on extra work. However, the author is in the position where he's handling more responsibilities. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. The request is practical, and he's explaining his reasoning. The wife's reaction might be due to her own stress, but that doesn't make the author's request wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
