It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about managing the kids and chores alone.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: cooking is the wife's responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he's asking her to prep meals. He wants to make sure the kids eat what they're used to. The wife, however, got upset and said it's too much work, offering that if it's hard, sandwiches are an option.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband is asking for help to manage a challenging week. It's reasonable to ask for support when someone is going to be absent, especially since the wife is experienced with the kids' preferences. But the wife might feel it's an extra burden on top of her trip preparations. She might be stressed about the trip itself and see meal prepping as adding to her workload.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to ask her to prep? Well, he acknowledges that she can do it, but she's also taking time off. If the wife is overwhelmed, the husband's request could be seen as not considering her current stress. However, he's trying to plan ahead to avoid meltdowns at home. There's a balance between being proactive and respecting each other's capacities.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I can see both sides. The husband's intent is to make things easier, which is valid. But the wife's reaction suggests she feels the request is too much. Communication might be the key here. Maybe they should have discussed it earlier to find a middle ground, like prepping some meals but not all, or adjusting expectations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe the husband isn't wrong for asking, but he could have considered her workload better. However, since the wife is the one refusing, perhaps the blame isn't on the husband. The answer hinges on whether the request was reasonable. Given that he's taking on a lot without her, asking her to prep might be a reasonable shared responsibility. So the answer is likely \"No,\" the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
