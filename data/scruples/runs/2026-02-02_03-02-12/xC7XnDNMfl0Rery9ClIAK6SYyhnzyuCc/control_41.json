It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time the husband will be handling everything alone. He asks her to prepare meals because he's not as comfortable with cooking as she is, especially since the kids are picky. She gets upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since he's taking over her chores, and he's not as skilled, meal prepping would help him avoid stress and the kids' meltdowns. The wife's reaction is that it's too much to ask, maybe feeling it's an extra burden on top of her trip prep. \n\nIs the husband being reasonable? Well, he's asking for help from the person who knows the kids' preferences best. But is meal prepping fair? She's going on a trip, so she might have other things to worry about. But he's handling more responsibilities, so maybe he's justified in asking for assistance. \n\nAlso, their roles are established\u2014cooking is her responsibility. He's not asking her to do something outside her usual duties; he's just asking for prep to ease his transition. But maybe she feels that since she's leaving, asking her to prep adds to her stress. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to do something that's beyond her normal responsibilities, just to prepare in advance. Since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, he's trying to prevent problems. His wife's response seems dismissive, offering sandwiches as a lesser alternative. That might indicate she's not willing to help, which could be unfair.\n\nBut maybe the husband is overstepping by assuming she should do the prep. However, given the circumstances\u2014first time alone, kids' picky eating\u2014it's a valid request. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any other angle. Did he consider her feelings? He might not have, but his reasoning is logical. The wife's reaction could be emotional. So, the answer is B.\n"
