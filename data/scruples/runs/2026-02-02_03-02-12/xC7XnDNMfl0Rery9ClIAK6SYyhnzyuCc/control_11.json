She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with as she is. The kids are picky eaters, so he wants her to prep meals for the week. She's upset, thinking it's too much work and offers to make sandwiches instead. The husband argues it's fair since she's the one leaving.\n\nSo, the main points are: the husband wants meal prep to avoid stress, she's resistant, and the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the fairness of the request. The husband is handling a lot of responsibilities without her, and cooking is a challenge he's not used to. He's asking her to prepare meals before her trip. But she's also taking time off, so maybe he's overburdening her. However, she's the one who knows the kids' preferences better, so her preparation could ease his burden.\n\nOn the other hand, she might feel that the trip is her time to recharge, and meal prepping is adding to her workload before she leaves. Her response of \"just make sandwiches\" suggests she's not willing to take on extra work. The husband might not realize that she's already stressed about the trip or that she feels she's being asked to do more than necessary.\n\nIs it unfair? If she's already planning a trip, which is a vacation, asking her to prep meals could be seen as adding to her pre-trip stress. But the husband's request is to make the week manageable for him. It's a balance between shared responsibility and understanding each other's capacities.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's in a new situation with more responsibilities. Asking her to prep meals might be a way to manage that. But if she feels it's too much, maybe he's not considering her workload. However, since the trip is her time away, maybe the husband should adjust his expectations of her helping even when she's gone. But meal prepping before she leaves isn't during the trip, so it's a one-time task.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have discussed this earlier or considered other solutions, like involving the kids more or using frozen meals. But given the info, he's trying to prevent meltdowns from the kids due to unfamiliar food.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's request is to make the week easier. She's the one who knows the kids' preferences, so her prep would help. However, if she's not willing, maybe the husband needs to find another solution. But is he at fault for making the request? It's a common practice for people to prep meals for someone else before they take over a task. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. However, his tone or the way he made the request might have contributed to her being upset. But based on the information given, the request itself is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
