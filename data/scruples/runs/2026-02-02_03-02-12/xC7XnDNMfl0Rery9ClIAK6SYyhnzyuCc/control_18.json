It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about handling the kids and chores alone. He asked her to prepare meals for the week so he can manage better. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband is taking on extra responsibilities during her absence, which is understandable. He's worried about the kids' picky eating and meltdowns if the food isn't right. The wife, on the other hand, is already going on a trip and might be stressed about that. The request for meal prep adds to her pre-trip workload.\n\nIs it fair for him to ask her to do the meal prep? Well, meal prepping can be time-consuming and maybe she's already planning to prepare for her trip. If the husband is aware that cooking is her responsibility and she's better at it, his request is practical. However, he's asking her to do something that might be an extra burden on top of her own travel prep. The wife's reaction suggests that she feels it's too much, which is valid because people can have different thresholds for how much they can handle.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? He's trying to plan ahead to avoid problems. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. If meal prepping is within her capacity and she's agreed to it before, maybe not. But if she's already stressed about her trip, adding this might be unfair. However, since he's considering the kids' preferences and his own capacity, he's trying to be proactive.\n\nThe wife's response of \"just make them sandwiches\" might be dismissive, but he's concerned about the kids' well-being. It's a communication issue. The husband isn't in the wrong for trying to get support, especially since the wife is taking the trip. She's the one who's away, so it's reasonable to expect her to help set things up. The problem might be that the request wasn't discussed in a way that considered her workload. Maybe he should have asked earlier or compromised. But in the situation as presented, the husband's request seems valid. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
