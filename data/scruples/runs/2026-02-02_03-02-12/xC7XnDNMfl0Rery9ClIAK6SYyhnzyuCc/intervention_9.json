It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The key points are that the wife is going away for a week, the husband is taking over her chores, and he's asking her to prep meals because the kids are picky and he's not as confident in his cooking skills. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggests sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that this is a first-time situation for him, handling both work and childcare without help. He's asking his wife to do something that would make things easier, given her experience with the kids' food preferences. The wife's response is that it's too much work, and she's offering an alternative that's easier for her but maybe not ideal for the kids.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a fairness standpoint, the husband is asking for help to manage a situation that's new and potentially stressful for him. His request is practical: he wants to minimize stress for the kids by maintaining their usual food routine. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that meal prepping is an extra burden, especially since she's going on a trip and might already be preparing other things. But her trip is the reason for the change in routine, so it's logical that she would want to prepare to ease the transition.\n\nI should also consider the nature of their household. If cooking is her responsibility and the kids are used to her meals, then asking her to prep makes sense. However, if the trip is a once-in-a-while thing, maybe the husband could have thought of other solutions, but the situation is unique. The wife's response of offering sandwiches might not be helpful, as the kids might not be satisfied with that. The husband's concern about meltdowns is valid if the kids are used to different meals.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband asked for help, and the wife felt it was too much. Maybe the husband could have asked earlier or discussed alternatives, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The wife's reaction might be about stress from the trip itself, leading her to feel overwhelmed by the request. However, the husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is trying to set himself up for success by asking for assistance. The wife's refusal could stem from her own stress or feeling like it's an added task. However, since she's the one leaving, it's logical that she would prepare to help him out. The alternative she offers isn't practical, so the husband's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband isn't in the wrong. He's making a practical request to manage a challenging week. The wife's reaction might indicate that she's feeling overwhelmed, but the request itself is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
