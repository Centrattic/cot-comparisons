It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who asked their wife to meal prep before her trip is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's not as experienced with because the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's concerned about the kids' reactions if the meals aren't the same.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't at fault, but they want my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nLet me consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is practical: he's worried about handling cooking for picky kids alone, and the wife knows their preferences better. Meal prepping could make his week easier. But the wife is taking a trip, maybe for work or personal reasons, and the husband's request adds extra work before her trip, which she might see as unfair. She might feel he's not sharing the responsibility fairly or that he's not confident in his ability to handle it.\n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? It's a common strategy to plan ahead when someone is going to be busy. But maybe he didn't consider her workload or stress before the trip. She might have other things to prepare. Alternatively, maybe he could have offered to help with the prep, but he didn't ask for her help in any other way. Also, telling her that if it's too hard, she can just make sandwiches might come off as dismissive of her effort. It's possible he didn't validate her stress about the extra work.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to set himself up for success. If the kids are used to her cooking, changing to something else might cause problems. It's a valid concern for a parent. The wife might not see it that way, feeling that the husband should take full responsibility once she's away.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But the key points are that he made a reasonable request to ease his own situation, perhaps without considering her perspective enough. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or offered to help with the prep. However, his intent isn't malicious. The wife's reaction might be due to stress about her trip. So, the husband might not be wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
