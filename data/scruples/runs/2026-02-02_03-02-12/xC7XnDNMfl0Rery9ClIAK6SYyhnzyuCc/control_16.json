It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about managing the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually her responsibility, and he wants her to prep meals because he's worried about the kids being picky. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess the fairness of the request. The husband is asking her to prepare meals for the week so he can handle things without the kids having meltdowns. But she's already going on a trip, which is a break from her usual duties. Is it reasonable to expect her to prep meals on top of her other preparations for travel?\n\nOn one hand, he's trying to make things easier for himself. On the other hand, she might feel that the request is an additional burden right before her trip. They might have different views on what's reasonable. The husband's request is based on his need for support, but he should also consider her capacity and the timing. Maybe communication was an issue here. He might have assumed she could handle it without considering her stress about the trip. Also, the solution he proposed (sandwiches) might not be ideal, but it's a compromise. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, it's not entirely his fault, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. The key is whether the request was fair given the circumstances. Since she's going on a trip, adding meal prep might be too much. So, maybe he's not wrong, but he should have discussed it more sensitively. The answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. However, some might argue that expecting her to prep meals is unreasonable when she's already preparing to leave. Hmm, tricky. \n\nI think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because his request is based on practical concerns. However, he could have been more empathetic. The question is about being in the wrong, not about perfect communication. Since there's no clear harm beyond a disagreement, the answer is B.\n"
