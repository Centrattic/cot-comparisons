It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep dinners for the kids in advance. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work, and suggests sandwiches instead. The husband feels it's reasonable since she's going away and knows the kids' preferences better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's asking for help to manage cooking for picky kids alone for a week. He's not a cook, and the wife is more experienced. Meal prepping would prevent stress and meltdowns. On the other hand, the wife is taking a trip, which is a time for her to be away from the kids. She might feel that asking her to prep meals is an added burden on top of her trip. She might also be concerned about the effort required or perhaps not wanting to give up her trip time to do that.\n\nIs the husband's request unreasonable? Well, the wife is going to be away, so maybe she has time during the trip to prep meals before leaving? But maybe she's already packing and preparing for her trip, and adding meal prep could be an extra task. The husband is asking her to do something that's a bit more involved than just making sandwiches. The wife might feel that the husband isn't considering her needs or the stress of her trip. \n\nAlso, the husband is taking over her chores, which is a big responsibility. Maybe he should have offered to share the meal prep or asked for help in another way. But the wife is the one who is more familiar with the kids' preferences, so maybe the request is valid. However, if the wife is already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might not be fair. \n\nThe key here is communication. The husband might not be in the wrong, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective enough. The wife's reaction could stem from feeling overwhelmed by the extra work. The husband's intention is good, but the way he approached it might have been a problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, since the wife is going away, perhaps the husband should have taken more initiative in learning about the kids' preferences or finding a compromise. The wife's refusal could be reasonable if the prep is too much. So, maybe the husband isn't entirely at fault, but there's room for both to adjust.\n"
