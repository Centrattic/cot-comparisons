It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Cooking is typically the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky. The husband asks her to prep the dinners for the week, but she gets upset, thinking it's too much work. He argues that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food and that since she's taking the trip, it's fair to ask.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He's asking for help to manage a busy week. The wife is the one who usually knows the kids' preferences, so asking her to prep in advance makes sense. He's not asking for something unreasonable, just to plan ahead so he doesn't have to handle everything during a tough week. It's a logistical request to make things easier for everyone, including the kids.\n\nThe wife's reaction: She finds it too much work. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels overwhelmed. But is her reaction justified? If she's going to be away, perhaps she doesn't need to do the prep while she's still around. But the husband is asking her to prep before she leaves so he can manage on his own. Maybe she feels it's an added burden on top of her trip preparations, but the husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIs the husband wrong? It seems like he's looking out for practical needs. The kids are picky, and the wife's knowledge is valuable. He's not forcing her; he's making a request to ease his own burden. The wife's refusal might be based on her own stress or workload, but the husband's request is about managing the household during her absence. \n\nI don't see the husband being in the wrong here. He's asking for assistance to handle an upcoming challenge. The wife's refusal could be due to her own reasons, but the husband isn't being unreasonable. So, the answer should be B.\n"
