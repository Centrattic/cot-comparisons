Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about asking their wife to meal prep for a week while she's away on a trip. The wife is going to be the kids' first time without her, and the husband is taking over her chores, including cooking. The wife got upset and refused to prep, saying it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is asking the wife to do something before her trip to make his week easier. Cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He wants to avoid meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food. The wife is upset because it's a lot of work, and she suggests sandwiches instead.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The husband is trying to plan ahead for a challenging week. It's reasonable to ask for help, especially since she's the primary cook. However, maybe he didn't consider her perspective. She's going away for the first time, which might be stressful for her too. Maybe she's already preparing for the trip and adding meal prep is an extra burden. The husband might not realize how much work it is to prep a week's worth of meals, especially for picky kids. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's request is practical. He's trying to manage responsibilities while alone with the kids. The wife's response of offering sandwiches seems dismissive of his concerns. If he's worried about the kids' reactions, maybe he should have discussed alternatives, like simpler meals or involving the kids in choosing options.\n\nI need to check if the husband is overstepping or not. Asking for meal prep isn't unreasonable, but maybe the way he approached it could be better. Did he give her enough notice? Was there prior discussion about dividing chores in her absence? If the wife feels it's an unreasonable request, maybe the husband didn't consider her workload. Also, the wife's reaction might be valid if meal prep is too much. But the husband's concern for the kids is also valid. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a balance. The husband wants help, but the wife might be overburdened. The answer depends on whether the request is reasonable. Since she's the primary cook and he's asking her to do prep before her trip, it's a common practice. However, the wife's refusal might indicate she's not in the right place to do that. The husband might need to negotiate another solution, like partial prep or different meals. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's trying to manage his responsibilities. But perhaps he didn't consider her capacity. The answer might be a B (No, he's not in the wrong) because it's a reasonable request, but communication could be better. The wife's reaction is valid if the prep is too much. The husband's intent is good, but maybe he needs to adjust his approach. So the AITA is No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
