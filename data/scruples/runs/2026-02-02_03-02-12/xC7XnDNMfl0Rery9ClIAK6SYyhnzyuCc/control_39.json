I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the author wants her to meal prep for the kids during that time. The wife gets upset because she thinks it's too much work, and the author feels it's reasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their household. The author mentions that cooking is usually the wife's responsibility because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. The author isn't against cooking but is concerned about handling both work and the kids' meals without the wife's help. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so the author is stepping into a role they aren't used to. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author is asking the wife to do something (meal prep) before her trip to make it easier for him. 2) The wife feels it's too much work. 3) The author doesn't see it as unfair since the wife is going away, while the wife is upset about the request.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're trying to prepare to manage without the wife, and meal prepping would reduce stress. From the wife's perspective, she might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip preparation, especially since she's already going away and might be stressed about that. Also, maybe she feels that the author should take on the responsibility since she's not there. \n\nI need to consider if the author is overstepping by expecting the wife to do this. Is it reasonable to ask someone preparing for a trip to take on extra work? Alternatively, maybe the author should have taken responsibility himself, even if it's more challenging. \n\nThe wife's response of suggesting sandwiches seems dismissive and possibly not considering the author's concerns. The author is trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids over unfamiliar food, which is a valid concern if the kids are picky. However, the wife might feel that the author is not being supportive by making this a burden on her before her trip.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to plan ahead, but maybe he could have discussed it more to find a compromise. However, the wife's refusal and the author's frustration are both points to consider. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because he's trying to manage the situation practically. The wife's reaction might be more about the stress of the trip and the added responsibility. The author could have been more empathetic, but the request itself seems reasonable. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
