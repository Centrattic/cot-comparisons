On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about asking the wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since having kids. The husband is staying behind and will be handling all the chores and cooking. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife usually handles cooking because she knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair because she's taking a week off, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nNow, let's break it down. The husband's request seems reasonable because he's handling a lot more responsibilities. Prepping meals could ease his burden. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work before her trip, which she's already preparing for. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself and doesn't want the added task. It's possible that communication is an issue here. The husband might not realize that the prep work is a significant ask for her, especially if she's already busy with her own trip preparations. On the other hand, the husband's concern is valid; he's managing the household alone and wants to avoid stress for the kids. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage his new responsibilities. But maybe he didn't consider how the request would affect her. If the wife feels it's too much, then he might need to find another solution. However, the husband's intentions are good. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week isn't trivial, but since the wife is away, maybe it's fair to ask. But if the wife is overwhelmed, then perhaps the husband should have discussed it earlier or found an alternative. \n\nThe answer might depend on their usual dynamics. If they've communicated well in the past, maybe the wife's reaction is out of proportion, but if the husband hasn't considered her workload, he might be overstepping. Without more info, it's a judgment call. But generally, asking a spouse to help with a task that's within their capability, especially for the benefit of the kids, isn't necessarily wrong. However, the wife's reaction suggests she's under stress. So maybe the husband should have approached it differently. But is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. The answer might be B (no), but I need to be careful.\n"
