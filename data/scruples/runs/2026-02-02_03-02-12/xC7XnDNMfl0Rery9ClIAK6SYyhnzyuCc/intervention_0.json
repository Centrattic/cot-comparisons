It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the week. The main points are that the wife usually handles cooking, the kids are picky, and he's worried about dealing with that alone. He asks her to prep meals, but she gets upset and says it's too much work. He argues it's fair since she's taking time off, and he's not in the wrong.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is the primary cook, right? She knows the kids' preferences better. The husband is concerned about handling it alone, especially since it's the first time the kids are away from her for a week. He's also dealing with work and other chores. So his request is practical, aiming to reduce stress and ensure the kids have familiar meals.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is an added burden. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip or feels that meal prepping a week's worth of meals is a lot of extra work. She might also see it as an unfair expectation, especially if they usually split chores a certain way. The husband is asking her to do something before she leaves, which could be seen as reasonable, but she's pushing back. \n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or social norm here? In many relationships, when someone is going away and the other is taking over responsibilities, it's common to prepare in advance. But maybe the wife is overburdened, or maybe the husband isn't considering her perspective. If meal prepping is a significant task, maybe the husband should have offered to help or split the prep work. However, he does mention that he can do it but it's harder for him because he's less familiar with the kids' preferences.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's reaction. She getting upset might indicate that the request is a problem. But the husband's intention is to make things easier for himself. So, whose responsibility is it? If they haven't discussed this before, maybe there's a communication issue. The husband could have asked more kindly or offered to help with the prep. Alternatively, he might be reasonable in expecting her to prepare since she's the one who's going away and the kids are used to her cooking.\n\nBut is it fair to ask her to do all the meal prepping? If she's already doing her part by cooking normally, and now he's adding a week's worth of prep, that might be too much. However, since she's going on the trip, maybe it's a fair trade-off. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. The husband is trying to manage his workload, and the wife is feeling overburdened. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's making a practical request to ease his own burden during a time when he's taking on more responsibilities. But maybe he could have approached it differently, like offering to help with the prep or compromising. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether he could improve. Since his request is based on a real need and he's not being unreasonable, the answer is B.\n"
