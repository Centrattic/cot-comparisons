      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The husband asked her to prep dinners for the week to make it easier on him. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work and suggested he could just make sandwiches if it gets too hard. The husband is worried about the kids' meltdowns without their usual food and doesn't think it's unfair since she's going away.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about expectations and fairness. The husband is trying to prepare because he's not as confident in his ability to cook for picky kids. He's asking the wife to help by prepping, but she's resistant. The wife might feel that since she's the one who usually cooks, she's already doing a lot, and this extra task is too much, especially before her trip. Or maybe she feels it's unreasonable to expect her to work that hard before leaving.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to set himself up for success and avoid stress. He's asking for something that's within his wife's usual responsibilities. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the husband isn't acknowledging her own workload or that he's not stepping up to handle the cooking himself.\n\nI think it's about communication. The husband's request is reasonable, but maybe he didn't consider how the wife feels about it. If the wife is already stressed about her trip or has her own preparations, asking her to do extra meal prep could be adding to her burden. Alternatively, the husband could have considered another solution, like prepping simpler meals or getting help elsewhere. But the wife's response seems dismissive, suggesting that making sandwiches is an option, which might not be ideal for the kids.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to prepare and asking for support. But maybe he should have had a more collaborative approach, discussing options rather than making a direct request. However, given that cooking is her usual responsibility, the request isn't inherently unfair. The wife's reaction might be about feeling overwhelmed or not wanting to take on extra work before her trip. It's possible both sides have valid points. But since the question is whether the husband is in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because his request is reasonable given the circumstances, even if the wife's reaction is valid too.\n"
