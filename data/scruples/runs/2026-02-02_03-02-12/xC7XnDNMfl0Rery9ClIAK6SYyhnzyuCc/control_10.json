She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids. The husband will have to handle all the chores and cooking. Normally, the wife does the cooking, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's worried about the kids being picky and not handling the meltdowns. He thinks he's not in the wrong because she's the one going away, so he's asking her to do something to help him out.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband has a valid concern: he's taking on extra responsibilities during her absence. Meal prepping would make things easier for him. But why did the wife get upset? Maybe because she's already stressed about the trip, or she feels it's unfair to ask her to do more work right before leaving. She might also feel that he's not being supportive or that he's not willing to step up. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband's request is reasonable, but the wife perceives it as an extra burden. It's possible that he didn't consider her perspective\u2014she might already be doing a lot and now adding meal prep could be overwhelming. Alternatively, he might be right in expecting her to help since she's the one who's more familiar with the kids' meals. \n\nIn relationships, understanding each other's stress points is crucial. The husband is trying to mitigate his own stress by asking her to prep, but she's probably stressed about the trip and the added task. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping for a few days instead of the whole week. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe wife's reaction is a red flag. If she got really upset, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there's a pattern of her feeling overburdened, or he's not sharing chores fairly. If he's usually not doing his share, then asking her to prep might be unfair. But if he's willing to take on most of the chores except cooking, and she's the expert there, then his request isn't unreasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have offered to find a compromise, like her prepping some meals and him handling others, or maybe she's not comfortable with the idea because she's worried about the time or effort. The answer hinges on whether the request is fair given their usual responsibilities and communication.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's request seems reasonable, but the wife's reaction might indicate deeper issues. However, since he's asking her to do something that's part of her usual role and it's to make things easier, he's probably not in the wrong. The problem might lie in how the request was made or the wife's stress levels. So the answer is B (No).\n"
