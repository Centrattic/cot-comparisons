It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the author is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually the wife's job, and the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work.\n\nHmm, so the author's request is based on practicality. He's concerned about managing the kids' meals without the wife there, who knows their preferences better. The wife's reaction seems to be that the request is too burdensome. The key points here are about shared responsibilities and expectations.\n\nI need to consider if the author's request is reasonable. Since the wife is going on her first trip away from the kids, maybe she's already stressed about leaving. The author wants to prepare for the week he's taking over. Meal prepping could reduce stress for both, but the wife might feel it's unfair or too much added work before her trip. However, the author is not asking her to do everything, just to prep meals to make his week easier. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered other solutions, like involving the kids in meal choices or adjusting the meal plan. But he's asking for help from the person who knows the kids best. The wife's refusal might stem from feeling that the request is adding to her pre-trip stress. But is the author wrong for expecting her to help, given that she's more experienced with the kids' meals? \n\nIt's a balance between mutual support and realistic expectations. The author isn't forcing her to do something impossible; he's asking for a practical solution. The wife's reaction suggests she feels it's too much, but the author's intention is to avoid meltdowns from the kids. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not, because his request is reasonable and aimed at making the transition smoother. The wife's refusal might be due to her own stress, but the author's intention is valid. So answer B.\n"
