It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since their birth. The husband is handling all the chores and cooking alone for the first time. Since cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky eaters, he asked her to prep dinners for the week so he can manage better. She got upset and refused, suggesting he could just make sandwiches if it gets too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is taking on a significant new responsibility (all the chores and cooking alone) because the wife is away. He's asking for help to make this manageable, specifically by having prepped meals. The wife is upset, saying it's too much work. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation here? In many relationships, partners share responsibilities. If cooking is her usual role, maybe he's not wrong to expect her to do some prep before leaving. But maybe the wife feels overburdened, especially if the trip planning adds extra work on top of her usual duties. The key points are that it's her first time away, he's new to handling everything alone, and the kids are picky.\n\nHe's not making her go on the trip; he's just asking for help to make his week easier. The wife's response is dismissive (\"just make sandwiches\"), which might downplay his concerns. If the kids are used to her cooking and he's worried about meltdowns from different meals, it's reasonable to want consistency. \n\nBut maybe the wife feels that prep work is too much, especially if she's already stressed about being away. The husband's request is practical, but the wife's refusal could be due to stress or feeling that her own needs aren't considered. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's setting up a practical solution to manage the challenges he'll face. However, communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed it more or offered alternatives. But based on the info given, he's not wrong to ask for help. The wife's reaction is more concerning. So answer B.\n"
