It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids. The husband is worried about handling everything alone, especially cooking. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He feels it's reasonable because she's away, and he's not as good at cooking the kids' meals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's taking on a lot of extra responsibilities with the kids and work. Cooking is the wife's main role, and the kids are picky. He's asking for help to make it manageable. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is a time for rest or work, and he's asking her to do extra prep work right before leaving. She might feel it's too much, especially if she's already busy with packing or other tasks related to her trip.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? Well, it's a common practice for people to prepare meals before a trip to save time later. But if she's not up for it, maybe there's a middle ground. The husband could acknowledge her workload and offer alternatives. The wife's reaction might be due to stress about the trip or feeling overwhelmed. The husband's request is understandable, but he should consider her feelings and maybe find a compromise.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and understanding. The husband isn't wrong for wanting to make things easier, but he should check in with his wife and see if there's another way. The wife's refusal might be valid if she's already stressed. So, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong, but he could handle the situation better. The answer probably leans towards B (No) because the request is reasonable, but there's room for compromise.\n"
