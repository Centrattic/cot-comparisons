It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife usually handles cooking because she knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week so he doesn't have to deal with the kids' meltdowns over unfamiliar food. She got upset, saying it's too much work and told him to just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility distribution, expectations during the wife's absence, and whether the request is reasonable. The husband is asking for help to manage the situation, but the wife feels the request is excessive. \n\nThe husband's argument is practical. He's asking for something that would make his week easier, especially since he's not used to handling the cooking alone. The wife's response suggests she might feel overwhelmed or perhaps that the request isn't fair given it's her trip. But considering that she's going away and he's taking over her responsibilities, it's reasonable to expect some preparation to make the transition smoother. \n\nThe wife's alternative of making sandwiches might be easier for her, but the husband is concerned about the kids' reactions. Since the wife is more familiar with their preferences, having her prep meals would logically reduce stress for both the husband and kids. \n\nIs the request unfair? The husband isn't asking her to do more than she's already responsible for; he's just shifting the timing. Meal prepping is a time management strategy, which is common when someone is away. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling that the request is adding extra work, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable ask. \n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting her to prep meals. The issue here is about balancing responsibilities and understanding each other's perspectives. The wife could also be more accommodating by prepping, but the husband's request is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
