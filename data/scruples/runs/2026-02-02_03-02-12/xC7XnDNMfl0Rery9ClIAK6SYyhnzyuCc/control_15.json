Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation involves the wife going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is concerned about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The husband is asking the wife to prepare meals for the week so he can manage without her. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggests making sandwiches instead. The husband argues it's fair to ask since she's going away, but the wife feels it's an unfair burden.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Factors to consider: Is meal prepping a normal part of their routine? The wife is responsible for cooking, but this is a temporary arrangement during her absence. The husband is taking over her responsibilities, so it's logical to want her to help set things up. However, the wife might feel that since she's going away, it's the husband's responsibility now. There's also the emotional aspect of her being upset by the request, which might indicate that the husband didn't consider her feelings or workload before asking.\n\nBut wait, the husband's reasoning is practical: the kids are picky, and he wants to avoid meltdowns. Meal prepping could save time and reduce stress. However, if the wife is already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be too much. The husband's request is about delegation, but maybe he should have discussed alternatives first, like partial prepping or adjusting the meal plan. \n\nIs the husband wrong for making the request? It's a matter of perspective. He's trying to manage his own stress and responsibilities, which is understandable. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the request might be unreasonable. If meal prepping for a week is a significant amount of work, and she's already preparing for her trip, adding this task could be seen as unfair. The husband could be assuming she has the time and capacity, which might not be the case. \n\nAlso, the wife's suggestion to make sandwiches implies she doesn't think prep is necessary. The husband might be overestimating the need for prepped meals. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. The husband didn't consider that the wife might have other things to do before her trip, so his request could be seen as not considering her perspective. \n\nIn summary, the husband's intentions are practical, but the way he made the request might have been heavy-handed. He might not be in the wrong entirely, but the wife's reaction indicates that the request could be unreasonable given her current workload. The key is whether the request is fair considering the circumstances. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his request is based on practical needs, but some might argue it's A (in the wrong) because he didn't consider her situation. However, the community often leans towards practicality in such cases. So, likely answer is B.\n"
