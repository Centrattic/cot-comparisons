It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about managing the household and cooking for the kids, who are picky. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he make sandwiches instead. The husband thinks it's fair because she's the one going away.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The husband is taking over her chores, which includes cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband is trying to make it easier by having her preprep meals. The wife feels it's too much work. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for making that request.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, when someone is going to be away and their responsibilities are shifted to another person, it's reasonable to ask them to prepare as much as possible to ease the transition. Meal prepping could help maintain consistency for the kids and reduce the husband's stress. On the other hand, the wife might feel that since she's working hard to get ready for her trip, adding meal prep is an extra burden she hadn't anticipated, especially if she's already preparing for her own trip. \n\nBut the husband's request is specific to meals, which are part of her regular responsibilities. If the wife normally handles cooking, it's logical that she would know the kids' preferences better. By asking her to preprep, the husband is trying to maintain the kids' routine and reduce his workload. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed or not wanting to take on extra work before her trip. However, the husband is not asking her to do something unreasonable in terms of the task itself; meal prepping is a common practice for many people. \n\nThe wife's suggestion to just make sandwiches might not be feasible if the kids are very picky and used to certain meals. The husband is trying to prevent meltdowns from the kids, which is a valid concern. It's about balancing the need for support with the understanding of each other's workloads. If the wife is in a position where she can't prepare meals, that's one thing, but if she's able and the husband is asking for a reasonable amount of prep, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nPotential issues could be if the request is excessive or if there's a lack of communication. But in this case, the husband is asking for a week's worth of dinners, which is a specific and limited request. The wife's refusal might be more about her own stress related to the trip rather than the request itself. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's request seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
