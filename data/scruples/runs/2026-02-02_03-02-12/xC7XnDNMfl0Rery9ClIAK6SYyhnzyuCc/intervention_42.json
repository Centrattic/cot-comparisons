She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the kids while she's away on a week-long trip. The wife got upset and refused, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is asking his wife to prepare meals for the week before her trip. He explains that cooking is usually her responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he's not as confident in his ability to replicate her cooking. He's worried about the kids' meltdowns if they don't get their usual food. The wife is upset that he's asking her to do this, considering it too much work. The husband's reasoning is that it's fair because she's taking the week off, and he's left managing everything alone.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's trying to make sure things run smoothly while she's away. He's taking on her chores and managing the kids, which is a lot. Meal prepping would help him avoid daily stress. It's reasonable for him to ask for help, especially since she's the one who usually handles this.\n\nBut from the wife's side, being asked to prep meals for a week before a trip might be seen as an extra burden. She might feel that she's already preparing for her trip and doesn't want to add meal prep on top of that. Maybe she feels it's too time-consuming or that it's not her responsibility to solve his problem while she's away. Also, the husband's tone could be an issue. If he phrased it as a request and she still refused, maybe he needs to compromise, but maybe his request was reasonable.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal expectation here? In many relationships, partners share responsibilities. If cooking is her usual role, expecting her to help in preparation might be normal. However, if she's already under stress with her own trip, maybe he should have offered to take on more rather than expecting her to do extra work right before leaving.\n\nAnother angle: The wife's response was to say it's too much work, and suggests sandwiches. That's a valid point. Maybe he should have considered that she's stressed about her trip and not want to add to her workload. Alternatively, he could have offered to take over more at home instead of asking her to prep.\n\nIs the husband's request unfair? Meal prepping for a week is a significant task. If the wife agreed to do it in the past, maybe not. But if this is the first time, maybe he's placing an unfair expectation on her. Also, the fact that she's the one who usually does the cooking doesn't automatically mean she should be responsible for prepping before her trip. Perhaps the husband should have taken initiative, even if it's harder for him.\n\nSo, the husband's motivations are practical, but the wife's reaction is also valid. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. Since she's going away, she might not be available to help, but she's being asked to do something before she leaves. The husband might not be wrong in his reasoning, but maybe he didn't consider her workload or feelings. The wife's refusal could be because she feels it's too much, and if the husband is taking over her usual duties, maybe he should handle the meal prep himself, even if it's challenging.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's request is understandable, but the wife's reaction is also valid. However, since he's the one making the request and she's the one who's supposed to do the prep, maybe he's in the wrong for not considering her workload or not offering alternative solutions. But if it's fair to ask for help from the spouse before they leave, then he's not. It's a bit of a grey area, but since the wife is upset, maybe the husband should have found another way to handle the meals without making it her responsibility while she's preparing for her trip.\n"
