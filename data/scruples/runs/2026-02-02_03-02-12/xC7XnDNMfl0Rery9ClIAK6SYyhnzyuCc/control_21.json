It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. He's worried about handling the kids' picky eating and taking over her chores. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, and since they're picky, he wants consistency. The wife is going on a trip, so she's not around to help. The author is asking her to prepare meals in advance, which makes sense for his situation. But the wife is stressed about the extra work, maybe feeling it's too much on top of her trip prep.\n\nIs the author being reasonable? Meal prepping isn't uncommon when someone is away. It's a way to plan ahead. The wife's response, suggesting sandwiches, might be a way to minimize her effort, but sandwiches might not be what the kids usually eat. The author wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids if their usual meals aren't there. \n\nBut is it fair to ask her to do that? Since she's going away, maybe she has her own things to prepare. However, the trip is her first time away from the kids, so maybe she's already stressed. The author is trying to manage his responsibilities. \n\nPossible angles: The author is trying to be proactive. The wife feels overwhelmed. It's a communication issue. The author could have discussed it earlier, but the wife might feel the request is excessive. \n\nI think the key is whether the request was reasonable. Meal prepping isn't unreasonable, but if the wife is already busy, maybe the author should have considered that. However, the author's perspective is valid because he's handling more responsibilities. It's a balancing act. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities during her absence. The wife's reaction might be about her stress, but the request itself is reasonable. So answer B.\n"
