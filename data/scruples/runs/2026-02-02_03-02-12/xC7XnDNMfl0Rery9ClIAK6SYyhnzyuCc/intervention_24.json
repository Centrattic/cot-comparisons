It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the wife is going away for a week, and the author wants her to prepare dinners because he's concerned about handling the kids' picky eating and the chores. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he can just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is that since he's not used to cooking and the kids are picky, meal prepping would make it easier. He's taking on the responsibility of the chores and the kids alone, so asking for help here seems reasonable. On the other hand, the wife might feel that meal prepping for a week is an extra workload, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself or feels that the request is unfair given the circumstances.\n\nI should consider if the request is reasonable. Meal prepping can be time-consuming, but if it's something manageable within her schedule before the trip, then it's a valid request. However, the wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed. The author's intention is to reduce his own stress, which is understandable. But does that make the request fair? It depends on their usual responsibilities and communication. If cooking is her role in the household, asking her to prepare meals before leaving might be reasonable. However, if she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be too much. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author could have discussed this earlier to avoid last-minute stress. But given the situation, the request isn't unreasonable. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
