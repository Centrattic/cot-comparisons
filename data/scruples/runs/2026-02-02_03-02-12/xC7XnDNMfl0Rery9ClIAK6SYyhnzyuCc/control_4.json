It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores alone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is taking on a big responsibility with the kids and chores for a week. He's not a cook, and the kids are picky. His wife usually handles cooking and knows their preferences better. He wants her to prep meals to make his week easier. The wife, however, gets upset and says it's too much work, offering sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, he's asking for help from his spouse before she goes away. It's reasonable to expect some support when someone is taking a break. But maybe the wife is overburdened? But she's the one going on a trip, so she has time before leaving to prepare. The key point is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking for something unreasonable; he's trying to set himself up for success. The wife's response might be dismissive, but the husband's request is practical. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he's asking for something that's within her capacity and would help him. Alternatively, maybe the wife is right if she's already stressed, but the question is about the husband's actions. The answer here is likely B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
