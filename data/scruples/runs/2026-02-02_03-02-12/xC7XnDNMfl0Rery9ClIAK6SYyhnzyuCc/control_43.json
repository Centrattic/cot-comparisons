On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband's wife is going on a week-long trip, and he asked her to meal prep for the week so he can handle the kids and chores. She got upset and refused, saying it's too much work. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid reason: the kids are picky, and the wife usually handles cooking. He's worried about not being able to manage alone, especially with the kids' preferences. Meal prepping would save him time and stress. On the other hand, the wife is taking a trip for the first time, which might be stressful enough. She might feel that being asked to prep meals adds extra pressure on top of her trip preparations. Her response about just making sandwiches if needed could imply she feels it's not necessary or that she's being overburdened.\n\nIs the husband being reasonable? He's asking for a favor to help manage responsibilities. But maybe he didn't consider her workload or how she's feeling about the trip. The wife might need time to prepare for her trip without extra tasks. The key here is communication. Did the husband consider how she might be feeling about the trip and her own responsibilities? If he just asked without considering her stress, maybe that's where he's wrong.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. If she's upset, it's possible she feels taken advantage of or that her needs aren't being considered. But the husband's concern about the kids is valid too. The question is whether his request was unreasonable. Since she's going away, maybe it's fair to ask for some help in advance, but maybe he should have offered to contribute or found another solution.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband considered her feelings and workload. If he didn't, he might be in the wrong. But if he did ask respectfully and she still refused, maybe not. The problem is the wife's reaction suggests the request was a burden. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's asking for help, but he could have approached it differently. But the answer depends on the context. Since the wife is going away and it's her first time, perhaps the husband's request is reasonable. Alternatively, maybe he should have been more flexible. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage responsibilities, but maybe A if he didn't consider her feelings. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer might be B because he's making a practical request, but some might say A because he's adding to her trip prep. I think B is more likely correct.\n"
