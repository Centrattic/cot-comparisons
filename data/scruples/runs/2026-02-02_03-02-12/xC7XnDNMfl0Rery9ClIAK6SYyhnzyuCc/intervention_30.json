It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep for the kids because he's not as experienced with their picky eating habits. The wife gets upset and says it's too much work for her, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is asking his wife to preplan meals because he's concerned about handling the kids' picky eating alone. His reasoning is that since she knows their food preferences better, and he's already taking on her chores during her absence, meal prepping would make things easier. The wife feels it's too much to ask, maybe overwhelmed by the additional work or perhaps feeling that he should handle it himself.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate both sides. The husband's request is practical and aimed at reducing his workload. He's not asking for something unreasonable; he's asking for prepped meals to avoid stress and potential meltdowns from the kids. However, the wife's reaction suggests she might feel that the request is excessive, possibly because she's already dealing with her own travel preparations or feels that the request is unfair given that she's going away. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's reasonable for the husband to seek support in managing the household during her absence. Since meal prep is part of her usual responsibilities, asking her to do it before she leaves could be seen as a logical way to share the load. On the other hand, if the wife is already stressed about the trip or has other commitments, adding meal prep might be a fair point of contention. However, the husband's intention is to make the transition smoother for everyone, especially the kids, so it's not an unreasonable request. \n\nThe wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might indicate a lack of support or understanding of his situation. The husband isn't asking for her to do something she can't handle; he's trying to avoid a problem. If the wife is truly overwhelmed, maybe they need to find a middle ground, like prepping a few key meals instead of all of them. But the core of the issue is whether the request itself is inconsiderate. \n\nConsidering that the husband is stepping into a role he's less familiar with, seeking some assistance from his wife, who has more experience, isn't unreasonable. The wife's refusal could stem from her own stress or feeling that the request is too much, but the husband's concern for the kids' well-being and his own ability to manage is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. His request is practical and aimed at reducing stress during a challenging time.\n"
