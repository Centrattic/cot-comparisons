It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife is going on a week-long trip, and he asked her to meal prep for the kids during her absence. She got upset and refused, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's too hard. The author feels it's reasonable to ask her since she's going away and she's the one who usually cooks.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking over her chores, and since the kids are picky, meal prep would help avoid meltdowns. He's not expecting her to cook during her trip, just to prepare the meals beforehand. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is burdensome, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or has other responsibilities. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual understanding. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable\u2014he's trying to make the week manageable. However, his wife's refusal might stem from feeling overwhelmed. The author might not realize that meal prepping could be as time-consuming as she's indicating. But the author's intent is practical, to avoid stress during her absence. \n\nI should consider common household responsibilities. If they usually share chores, then the author taking over her share during her trip makes sense. Meal prepping could be a way to split the work. However, if the wife feels that the request is too much, there's a communication issue. The author might not have considered her perspective, assuming she can handle it. But he's also trying to prevent problems with the kids.\n\nIs there any cultural or situational nuance I'm missing? If the wife has already been prepping for her trip (packing, etc.), adding meal prep might be an extra burden. The author might not have considered her workload. But he's also in a difficult position with the kids. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. The author's request is understandable, but the wife's reaction suggests she feels it's unfair. However, the author isn't in the wrong if his intention is to manage the household during her absence. The problem might be in the communication\u2014maybe he should have asked more gently or considered alternative solutions. But given the facts, the author's request is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
