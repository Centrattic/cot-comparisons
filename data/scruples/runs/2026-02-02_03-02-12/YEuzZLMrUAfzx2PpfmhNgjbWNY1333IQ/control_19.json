Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award by making her cry. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on this girl, Beck, who accepted their invitation. Then they found out Beck had manipulated her friends to tolerate the author for a week to win an award. The author felt betrayed and decided to report her, which led to her nomination being withdrawn. Now, people are saying the author is wrong, and they're getting ostracized, but the author feels satisfied.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the actions taken. The author discovered the manipulation and took steps to stop the award. But was it right to do so? On one hand, Beck used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is unethical. On the other hand, the author's response was to sabotage her, which might be considered revenge. \n\nThe author's actions involved researching the award, checking the list, and possibly submitting false information to get the nomination withdrawn. That could be seen as interfering with a legitimate process. Even if Beck was being deceptive, the author's method of stopping her might not be the right approach. Instead of confronting Beck or the authorities properly, the author took a more underhanded approach, leading to negative consequences for both parties.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. They were hurt and felt manipulated, but exacting revenge by undermining Beck's award might not be justified. The outcome was that Beck cried and her nomination was withdrawn, but the author is now ostracized. The author might feel justified, but the method used is questionable. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while Beck's actions were deceitful, the author's response of purposefully sabotaging her award is likely the wrong approach. The correct course would be to address the situation through appropriate channels, not personal retaliation. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
