Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who has been bullied and has facial scars, had a crush on a girl named Beck. They went on a date, and then found out Beck was using her for a \"positive role model\" award by pretending to be kind and then distancing after. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, leading to Beck crying and the author facing more ostracism.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. Beck manipulated the author for an award, using her kindness. The author discovered this through a friend and decided to sabotage Beck's nomination, leading to Beck's emotional distress and the award being withdrawn. The author now feels justified but is facing backlash.\n\nLegally, if the author lied or provided false information to revoke Beck's nomination, that could be problematic. But if they simply informed the committee of the truth (that Beck was using someone for the award), then it's a different scenario. Ethically, it's a tough call. Beck was deceitful and used someone's feelings for her own benefit, which is morally wrong. However, the author's retaliation involved making Beck cry and possibly damaging her chances at the award, which could be seen as revenge rather than a justified response.\n\nThe author's actions might have been a form of self-preservation after being manipulated. Beck's actions were exploitative, which is inconsiderate and harmful. The author's response, while emotionally driven, could be seen as a way to expose Beck's dishonesty. However, whether it's the right way to handle it is debatable. Using underhanded methods to stop someone else, even if they are guilty, might not be the best approach. But considering the author's history of being bullied and the betrayal, their actions might be understood as a reaction to being used and hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If Beck's actions were indeed unethical, then the author's exposure of her might be justified. However, the method used\u2014possibly without due process or evidence\u2014could still be problematic. It's a gray area. The author might not be entirely wrong given Beck's manipulation, but their method of retaliation might have crossed a line. But based on the information given, the primary wrongdoer here is Beck. The author's actions were a response to being wronged, which complicates the moral judgment. So, the answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as Beck's actions were the root of the problem, and the author was reacting to that.\n"
