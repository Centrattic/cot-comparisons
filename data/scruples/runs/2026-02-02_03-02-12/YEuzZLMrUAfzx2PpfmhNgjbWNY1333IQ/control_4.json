Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, leading her to cry. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck and went through a lot of effort to ask her out. Beck accepted, but then the author found out that Beck was using the relationship to boost her own college applications by getting the \"positive role model\" award. Beck's friends told the author that she was only being kind temporarily to get the nomination, then planned to distance herself after March.\n\nThe author then researched the award, confirmed her nomination, and took steps to have her name withdrawn, with the help of friends and family as alibis. The result was that Beck's nomination was withdrawn, and she's now crying, while the author feels no remorse and is now ostracized.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were emotionally manipulated. Beck used them for personal gain, pretending to care to get an award. The author felt betrayed and decided to retaliate by sabotaging Beck's nomination. They might argue that they were protecting themselves from further emotional harm and exposing Beck's deceit.\n\nOn the other hand, Beck's actions were unethical\u2014using another person's feelings for her own benefit. But does that justify the author's response? The author went to authorities or manipulated the system to have Beck's nomination removed. This could be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a legitimate complaint. The method might involve unethical actions, like lying or spreading false information, which could be considered wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The author's actions may have violated the rules of the award process. If they provided false information or interfered improperly, that's a problem. However, if they reported the truth (that Beck was inauthentic in her actions), maybe they did the right thing. But the way they approached it might be questionable. Instead of confronting Beck directly or letting the award committee handle it, the author took the matter into their own hands, which could be seen as revenge.\n\nEmotionally, the author was hurt and acted out of anger and betrayal. But retaliation can lead to a cycle of harm. The author now faces more ostracization, which might be a consequence of their actions.\n\nLegally and ethically, if Beck's nomination was based on false pretenses, the committee might have grounds to retract it if informed properly. However, the author's approach might not have been the correct channel. The right way would be to report the issue through official means, not to actively sabotage.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a response to emotional betrayal. But intentionally sabotaging someone's nomination, even if they were acting in bad faith, could be seen as wrong because it's a form of revenge that causes harm. However, if the author provided truthful information to the committee, maybe it's justified. The key is how the author went about it. If they lied or used underhanded tactics, that's wrong. If they told the truth, maybe it's a different story. The original post says the author \"went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list\" and then had friends as alibis. It's unclear if they provided false info or just informed the committee of the truth. If they reported the truth, maybe it's justified. However, if they fabricated evidence, it's not.\n\nBut the post says the author \"researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online. I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friends at work and family as alibi.\" It sounds like they confirmed the nomination and possibly used their contacts to provide alibis, which might not be necessary unless they were planning to report something. The exact method isn't clear, but the outcome was the withdrawal of Beck's nomination. If the author told the committee the truth about Beck's manipulation, then it's a valid action. But if they lied or used deceit, it's wrong.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the author's intent was to expose a fraudulent nomination, it might be seen as a justified action. However, the emotional component and the method of doing it without proper channels could still make the author in the wrong. The main question is whether the ends justify the means. If the author acted within ethical and legal boundaries to report the truth, it's okay. If not, it's wrong.\n\nGiven that the author's actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, and assuming they used legitimate means to inform the committee, it might be seen as right. But the way they went about it\u2014without confronting Beck first or using proper channels\u2014could be considered wrong. Also, the emotional reaction and seeking revenge might cloud their judgment, making their actions impulsive rather than measured.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's manipulation is clearly wrong, the author's response might cross the line into unethical retaliation. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they took matters into their own hands instead of reporting through proper channels or addressing the issue directly with Beck. Their actions caused harm (Beck crying, author being ostracized) and might not have followed the correct procedures.\n"
