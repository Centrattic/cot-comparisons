Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for what they did.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, who has been bullied and has scars, had a crush on a girl named Beck. He went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. They had a good time together, but then he found out she was using him for her social media image to win an award. She planned to interact with him for a few weeks and then distance herself. The author, feeling hurt and angry, stopped her from winning the award, which led her to cry. Now he's getting backlash from peers and is confused about whether he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and manipulation. Beck used the author's feelings for her own benefit. She manipulated people around him to act kind so her nomination for the award could look good. The author found out and took action to prevent her from winning. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, intentionally sabotaging someone's award might be unethical or even against the rules of the award itself. If the award is based on being a positive role model, then Beck's actions were insincere, but the author's response was to interfere with the process. Even if Beck was manipulative, the author's actions might have violated the award's procedures. So, while Beck's behavior was clearly wrong, the author's method of retaliation could be seen as taking justice into his own hands, which isn't appropriate. \n\nThere might be better ways to handle the situation, like reporting her actions to the award committee or confronting her directly. By taking matters into his own hands, the author might have crossed a line, even if he felt justified. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he intentionally stopped someone from winning an award, which is a form of sabotage and not addressing the issue through proper channels.\n"
