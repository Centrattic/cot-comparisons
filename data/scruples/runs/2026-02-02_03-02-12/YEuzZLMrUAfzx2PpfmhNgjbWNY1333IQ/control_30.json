Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate, Beck, from winning an award and making her cry. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a crush on Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out that Beck was using them for her own social media image to win a \"positive role model\" award. She planned to be nice to the author for a few weeks and then distance herself. The author got angry, checked the award details, and somehow got her nomination withdrawn, leading Beck to cry and the author being ostracized.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception by Beck and the author's response. Beck manipulated the author's feelings for her own benefit. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the author did something unethical or illegal to remove Beck's nomination, that's a problem. But the author didn't say they did something illegal, just that they informed the committee. Maybe they provided information or proof that Beck was being inauthentic. \n\nEthically, Beck used someone's emotions for her own gain, which is definitely wrong. The author felt betrayed and wanted to expose her. However, retaliating by sabotaging her award could be seen as harming someone else, even if they were wrong. The author might feel justified, but causing harm to another person, even in response to being harmed, can be considered wrong because it perpetuates a cycle of negativity.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's own experiences with bullying and low self-esteem. They were vulnerable and taken advantage of. Their actions might stem from a place of pain and a desire for revenge. However, making someone else cry and ruining their chances at an award could have consequences beyond just Beck\u2014like the author being ostracized further. \n\nThe community's reaction (\"Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong\") suggests that others see the author's actions as inappropriate. While Beck's actions were deceitful, the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. Maybe reporting the situation to authorities or seeking support would have been better than personal retaliation. \n\nIn summary, Beck's manipulation is the initial wrongdoing, but the author's retaliation could be seen as harmful and unethical. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to consider that the author was acting on being deceived and had a motive. However, the act of sabotaging the award, regardless of the reason, is generally considered wrong. The author's actions caused emotional harm to Beck and could have broader consequences. Therefore, even if Beck was at fault, the author's response is still considered wrong.\n"
