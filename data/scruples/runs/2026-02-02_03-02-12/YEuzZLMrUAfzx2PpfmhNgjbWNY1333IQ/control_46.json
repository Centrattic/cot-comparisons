Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author, who has facial scars from a past accident and has faced bullying, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. He went to a lot of effort to ask her out, and they had a date. Then he found out that Beck had been using their relationship for a 'positive role model' award by pretending to be kind to him to boost her college application. He got angry and took action to stop her from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the author now facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Beck's actions seem manipulative. Using someone's feelings for a personal gain is definitely unethical. She made posts that were degrading to the author, which is really hurtful. The author discovered this through a friend and then took steps to inform the committee, possibly by providing evidence. The key points here are: Beck's manipulation, the author's reaction to being used, and the consequences of the author's actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck's actions were wrong, but does that justify the author's response? The author intentionally sabotaged her award nomination. While Beck's behavior was malicious, the author's retaliation might have been public and caused Beck emotional distress. However, the author's motivation was to stop a lie and prevent someone from benefiting from deceit, which could be seen as a form of justice.\n\nBut, in terms of ethics and social norms, taking matters into one's own hands to expose someone else's wrongdoing, especially in a public way, might not be the right approach. The author could have reported it to the committee through official channels instead of directly causing the withdrawal. By doing so, the author might have breached privacy or acted without following proper procedures, even if the intention was good.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Beck is significant. She was crying after the nomination was withdrawn, which shows the author's actions had real consequences. However, considering the author's past trauma and the fact that Beck's actions were exploitative, there's a strong argument that Beck's behavior was worse.\n\nBut the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's method of response might be questionable. Exposing someone's nomination fraudulently could involve unethical behavior, like providing false information or leaking private details. The author might have done something that's against school policies or the award's rules. Therefore, while Beck's actions are deplorable, the author's retaliation might not be the correct way to handle it, leading to the conclusion that the author is in the wrong.\n"
