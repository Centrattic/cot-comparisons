Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped a classmate (Back) from winning an award by causing her nomination to be withdrawn. The author was heartbroken after discovering that Back was only being nice to him for a short period to boost her college application, and then planned to distance herself.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a relationship that turned out to be fake, leading to emotional pain. The author then took action to prevent Back from winning an award. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, intentionally harming someone's chances, even if they wronged you, can be seen as problematic. The author's actions led to Back crying and being ostracized, which might be considered a harsh consequence. However, the author's motivation was revenge for being manipulated, which can be understood but doesn't necessarily justify the action.\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit typically looks at both the actions and the context. While the author's actions were vindictive, the context of emotional betrayal and manipulation adds complexity. However, retaliating by sabotaging someone's award nominations is generally considered unethical, regardless of the reasons. The author's actions caused further harm, and even if Back was in the wrong, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's emotional state and history of bullying could provide some context, but it doesn't excuse unethical behavior. The key issue here is whether sabotaging someone's award nomination is an acceptable response to being manipulated. In most ethical frameworks, this would be considered wrong because it's a form of revenge that causes additional harm.\n\nSo, even though Back's actions were deceitful, the author's retaliation is not justified. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
