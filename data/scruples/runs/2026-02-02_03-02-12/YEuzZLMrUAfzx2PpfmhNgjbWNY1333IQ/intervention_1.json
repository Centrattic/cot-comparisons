Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped their classmate from winning an award by sabotaging her nomination. The classmate, Beck, apparently used the author's feelings for social media clout and college applications.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. The author discovered that Beck was pretending to be kind to them for personal gain. They then took steps to have her nomination withdrawn, leading Beck to cry. The author feels they were justified because they were manipulated and wanted to stop her from winning. \n\nOn one hand, the author was a victim of emotional manipulation. Beck used their insecurities and genuine feelings to boost her own image. The author might feel wronged and wanted to take action against someone who misled them. But on the other hand, sabotaging someone's award nomination is unethical and could be considered a form of revenge. It's not a legal or socially acceptable way to handle the situation. \n\nThe author's actions might have been driven by hurt and betrayal, but the method of confronting the issue was harmful. Instead of addressing it through proper channels, like confronting Beck directly or informing the authorities about her manipulation, the author chose to interfere with her award. This could be seen as crossing a line, even if their intentions were to protect themselves from further manipulation.\n\nAlso, the author's history of bullying and trauma adds complexity. They might have acted out of pain and a desire for self-respect. However, the consequences of their actions, like Beck's distress and their own increased ostracization, suggest that the method was counterproductive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while Beck's behavior was clearly manipulative and wrong, the author's response was also unethical. The appropriate action would have been to address the manipulation through open communication or seeking support, not to retaliate with sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions, though understandable in context, were harmful and not justified.\n"
