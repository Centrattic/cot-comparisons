Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by stopping their classmate from winning an award, which led to her crying. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they had a crush on Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and their relationship seemed to improve. Then they find out Beck was using them for social media clout to win an award. The author feels betrayed and decides to take action by contacting the authorities, which results in the award nomination being withdrawn. Now, Beck is upset and the author is facing backlash.\n\nSo, the key points here are: deception by Beck, emotional harm caused to the author, and the author's retaliation. Legally, if Beck was using false information or manipulating the award process, maybe the author's action is justified. But ethically, is it right to retaliate in such a way? The author's actions led to Beck being ostracized and crying. Even if Beck was in the wrong, did the author have the right to take matters into their own hands? Also, the author's emotional state is important\u2014feeling used and bullied before this incident. However, intentionally harming someone else's chances, even if they were deceptive, might still be considered wrong. The line between justice and revenge can be thin here. The author might have felt justified, but the method of confronting the issue directly with the committee could be seen as crossing a line. So, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. The correct answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they took personal revenge rather than addressing it through appropriate channels.\n"
