Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author wrote a song, got a gift, and asked a girl named Beck out, which she accepted. They had a date and the author felt happy. Then, the author found out that Beck was using him for a social media image to win an award, and that she had her friends act kind just for a week. The author got angry, checked the award's Facebook page, confirmed her nomination, and then somehow got her nomination withdrawn. The girl is now crying and the author feels satisfied with no remorse.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author wrong for stopping Beck from winning the award and making her cry?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's actions might be seen as retaliatory. Even if Beck was using him, the author took active steps to sabotage her. While Beck's actions were deceitful and harmful, intentionally causing harm in return (like ruining someone's award chances) might not be justified. The author's methods involved checking the nominations, possibly lying or interfering with the committee. That's a violation of trust and possibly ethical guidelines. The author might have valid reasons for feeling hurt, but the response was to harm Beck's opportunity, which could be considered the wrong approach. \n\nOn the other hand, Beck's behavior was manipulative and exploitative, which is definitely wrong. The author might feel justified in their retaliation. However, revenge doesn't make the action right. The author should have addressed the betrayal through communication or reporting, not by sabotaging the award. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions, while understandable in terms of emotional response, are ethically questionable. Sabotaging someone's legitimate opportunity, even if that person wronged you, is typically considered the wrong thing to do. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
