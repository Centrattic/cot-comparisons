Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 17-year-old who's been through bullying because of their scars, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went out on a date, and everything seemed great. But then, the author found out that Beck was using the author to boost her college application by pretending to be kind and then planning to distance herself. The author decided to sabotage Beck's nomination for a 'positive role model' award by getting her name removed, leading Beck to cry and the author now being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Beck intentionally manipulated the author's feelings for personal gain, which is definitely wrong. She used the author for her own benefit, which is unethical and possibly emotionally harmful. The author was in a vulnerable position, having been bullied and likely feeling insecure, and Beck took advantage of that. That's a serious issue, and Beck's actions were deceitful.\n\nNow, the author's response: they went to the authorities to get Beck's nomination withdrawn. The author had alibis and research to back this up. But is stopping someone from winning an award justified? Even if Beck deserved it for her actions, the author's method might be problematic. They might have broken rules or lied to the committee, which could be considered unethical or even a violation of school policies. The author's actions did cause Beck emotional distress, which is a consequence they might have to deal with.\n\nBut then again, Beck's actions were harmful. The author was manipulated, and their retaliation was a direct response to being used. The author might feel justified in exposing Beck's deceit. However, the act of sabotaging someone's nomination, even if they're at fault, is not the right way to handle it. The proper approach would be to report the manipulation through appropriate channels, not to take matters into one's own hands. The author's actions could lead to more harm, like the committee questioning the validity of their own processes or other students being discouraged from genuine kindness.\n\nAlso, the author is now facing backlash for their actions. While Beck's actions were worse, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally harmful because it's not addressing the root issue (Beck's manipulation) but instead causing personal harm. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck did something wrong, the author's actions might still be wrong because they took it upon themselves to punish Beck, which could be considered vigilantism.\n\nSo, considering both sides, Beck is clearly in the wrong for manipulating the author. However, the author's response, while understandable given their emotional state, might not be the right approach. The author's actions could be seen as a form of revenge rather than a constructive resolution. Therefore, even though Beck's actions were worse, the author is also in the wrong for their method of retaliation.\n"
