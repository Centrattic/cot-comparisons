Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author stopping their classmate from winning an award by getting her nomination withdrawn because they felt she used them for social media clout and college applications. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author was in a relationship with this girl, Beck, who they had a crush on. Beck's actions, according to her friend, were part of a plan to boost her own image for an award. The author found out, felt betrayed, and then took action to have her nomination withdrawn. The result was Beck crying and the author facing more ostracization.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the ethical aspects. The author discovered that Beck was using them for her own benefit, which is manipulative and harmful. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award. This action could be seen as unethical because it's retaliatory and possibly unfair. Even if Beck's actions were wrong, the author's method of stopping her might be considered harmful and possibly unjust. \n\nThe author mentions that they had their friend and family as alibis, which suggests they were careful in their approach. But the means of getting the nomination withdrawn\u2014like contacting the committee\u2014could be seen as underhanded. Even if the author felt wronged, taking matters into their own hands might not be the right approach. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Beck is significant; she's crying, and the author might be compounding the harm. While the author might feel justified, their actions could be considered wrong because they're causing direct harm, even if in response to perceived harm. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, people usually aren't supposed to take justice into their own hands. The proper course would be to address the issue through appropriate channels, like reporting the manipulation to the school or authorities, not sabotaging someone's opportunities. \n\nBut then again, Beck's actions were manipulative and exploitative. The author might feel that the system (the award committee) didn't account for this, leading them to act. However, the author's action of directly causing the nomination to be withdrawn without the committee's knowledge might be considered unethical, regardless of Beck's behavior. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a form of revenge. Even if Beck was wrong, the author's retaliation is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they resorted to sabotage instead of addressing the issue through proper means. The answer would be A.\n"
