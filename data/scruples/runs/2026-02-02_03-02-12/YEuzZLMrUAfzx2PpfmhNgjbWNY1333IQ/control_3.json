Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sabotaging a classmate (Back) from winning an award, which led to her crying. The author felt betrayed after realizing that Back was using their relationship for college applications.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a crush on Back, who accepted their advances. However, it turned out that Back was only being nice to them to boost her own social media presence and college application. The author found out through a friend and then took action by reporting her to the award committee, causing her nomination to be withdrawn. Now, the author feels justified but is facing backlash from others.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Back's behavior was manipulative and deceitful, which is clearly unethical. She used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is hurtful. On the other hand, the author's response was to sabotage her award nomination, which is a deliberate act of revenge. Even if Back was wrong, retaliating by undermining her award could be considered unethical or harmful.\n\nThe author might argue that they were defending themselves from further emotional harm and exposing a lie. However, the method of retaliation\u2014intentionally causing someone else's nomination to be withdrawn\u2014could be seen as crossing a line. It's possible that the author's actions were a form of justified self-defense against manipulation, but it's also possible that they took it too far by directly interfering with Back's personal goals.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author's own life. They mention being ostracized more, but they feel satisfied with their actions. This suggests that their emotional state was a significant factor. However, others might argue that the author should have addressed the situation in a more constructive way, such as confronting Back directly or seeking support without sabotaging her.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author might feel wronged, the act of actively preventing someone else's success\u2014especially for a personal reason\u2014can be seen as harmful. It's important to consider the balance between self-respect and the consequences of one's actions on others. Even if Back was manipulative, the author's response might not be the appropriate way to handle it. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and seeking revenge.\n\nAdditionally, the author's history of bullying and feeling ostracized might influence their actions, but that doesn't necessarily make their retaliation acceptable. It's a complex situation where both parties acted in ways that could be criticized. The author's actions, while understandable given the betrayal, might still be considered wrong because they involved deliberate sabotage rather than addressing the issue through proper channels.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings of betrayal are valid, their method of responding by sabotaging the award nomination is likely the wrong approach. It's important to handle such situations with integrity, even when dealing with personal pain. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
