Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation involves the author being manipulated by someone they had a crush on, who was using them for social media clout to win a college application award. The author discovered this manipulation, confronted it by having the nomination withdrawn, leading to the girl crying and the author facing more ostracization.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The girl, Beck, used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is manipulation. The author, after being hurt, took action to expose this. But actions have consequences. The author's method involved actively stopping Beck from winning the award, which might be seen as retaliation. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, Beck's actions were unethical. However, the author's response could be considered wrong because they took matters into their own hands instead of reporting the manipulation through proper channels. The author's actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, which might have affected her college applications. The author might feel justified due to the betrayal, but retaliating by undermining someone's achievements could be seen as unethical. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they are now more ostracized, but they have no remorse. This could indicate a sense of justice, but it's important to consider if their actions were proportionate. Destroying someone's nomination as revenge might not be the right approach. The author could have reported the manipulation to authorities or confronted Beck directly without sabotaging her award. \n\nSo, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. The moral of the story is that even if someone wrongs you, taking unethical actions in return can lead to negative consequences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their retaliatory actions, even if the initial betrayal was unjust.\n"
