Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old who had a crush on a girl named Back. They went through a lot to ask her out, made a song, got her favorite chocolate, etc. They thought they were finally accepted and had a good time together. But then they found out that Back was using them for a social media image to win an award. She made posts that were supposed to make her look kind, even though she was leading the author on. The author then went to the authorities, got her nomination withdrawn, and she ended up crying. Now the author is being criticized for doing that.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for stopping her from winning the award?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. The author discovered that their friend was using them for an award, which is a betrayal. The author felt manipulated and hurt. Their reaction was to take action by informing the committee, which led to the nomination being withdrawn. \n\nOn one hand, the author was protecting themselves from being used and exposing the truth. They were victims of emotional manipulation. But on the other hand, did they go too far? Did they have the right to interfere with the award process? \n\nBut wait, if the award was based on false or unethical behavior, then exposing that might be justified. The committee probably has rules against using others for such purposes. The author might have done the right thing by reporting the nomination. However, the method they used\u2014intentionally stopping someone from winning\u2014could be seen as retaliatory. Even if the other person was wrong, the author's actions might have been vindictive, especially since it led to the girl crying and more ostracization for the author.\n\nBut the author felt they were being used and manipulated. Their actions were a response to being lied to and used. The award was part of the girl's college application, which adds a layer of personal gain. The author might have felt that the girl was taking advantage of their situation for her own benefit.\n\nSo, is it right to expose the truth to prevent someone from getting an award based on a lie? Or is it wrong because the author took matters into their own hands instead of letting the committee handle it?\n\nAlso, the emotional impact: the girl cried, and the author felt satisfaction. That might indicate a lack of remorse, but the author might feel justified because they were the victim. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the girl was in the wrong for using the author. The author's action was a form of justice in their eyes. However, the method of intervention could be questionable. Instead of directly confronting the committee, maybe the author should have dealt with the emotional betrayal first. But the author's main goal was to stop the award, which was based on deception.\n\nI think the key points are: the girl was manipulative and deceitful, the author discovered the truth and took action to correct it, which might be justified. However, the author's satisfaction in making her lose the award could be seen as revenge. But if the award was based on false pretenses, then reporting it is the right thing. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girl was the one who started the manipulation. But the author's method might have been harsh. However, considering the context, maybe it's a gray area.\n\nBut according to the question, I have to choose A or B. The user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). Based on my analysis, the girl was in the wrong for using the author. The author's actions were a response to being manipulated. So the author is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
