Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award, leading her to cry. The situation involves the author feeling used after a friend of their crush told them that the crush was using them for a college application award.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck, who was being nice to them as part of a plan to win an award. When the author found out, they took action to stop Beck from getting the award. The author now feels ostracized but has no remorse.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author act wrongfully? Let's consider intent and actions. Beck's actions were manipulative and hurtful, using the author's feelings for personal gain. The author discovered this and took steps to expose or prevent Beck from winning the award, which led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Beck's behavior was clearly inconsiderate and exploitative. The author, after being hurt, decided to retaliate. But is retaliation justified? The author's actions involved researching the award, contacting authorities, and using alibis. This might be seen as sabotage, which is generally frowned upon, even if the motive is revenge for being used.\n\nHowever, the author was a victim of emotional manipulation. The question is whether the ends justify the means. While Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as taking it too far. The award might be based on genuine community service, and if Beck's actions were part of a genuine effort to be a role model (even if insincere), the author's interference could be seen as undermining a legitimate process.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to Beck crying and the author being ostracized. While the author might feel justified, the emotional impact on Beck is significant. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of feeling used, but using underhanded methods to stop someone from an award could be seen as unethical, regardless of the reason.\n\nAnother angle: The award might rely on nominations and perceived character. If Beck's actions were insincere, then the award committee might have been misled. The author's intervention could be seen as exposing the truth, which might be a positive action. But the method of doing so\u2014without confronting Beck first or reporting through proper channels\u2014could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, Beck's actions were wrong, and the author has been hurt. However, the author's response involved sabotage and potentially spreading information to the committee without giving Beck a chance to explain. That could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the right approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they resorted to retaliatory actions instead of addressing the issue directly or through appropriate channels.\n"
