Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, leading her to cry. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a crush on Beck, who they thought was genuine. Beck, however, was using the author to boost her social media presence for a \"positive role model\" award. The author found out and took action to have Beck's nomination withdrawn. \n\nNow, considering the actions. The author did some research, confirmed the nomination, and then took steps to get it removed. The result was Beck losing the award and crying, while the author feels no remorse. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, Beck was manipulating the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely unethical. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award. Even though Beck's actions were wrong, does that justify the author's retaliation? \n\nEthically, revenge isn't typically considered acceptable. The author didn't go through proper channels to address the manipulation. Instead, they took it upon themselves to ruin Beck's chances. This could be seen as a violation of the award's process and possibly unethical as well. \n\nBut the author's perspective is important too. They were emotionally hurt and felt betrayed. Their actions were a reaction to being used. However, even if someone wrongs you, retaliating in a harmful way can make you equally at fault. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. While Beck's behavior was clearly in the wrong, the author's method of stopping her might not be the right approach. The correct thing would be to report the manipulation to authorities or confront Beck, not sabotage her award. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions, while understandable given the betrayal, are still wrong because they resorted to sabotage instead of addressing the issue properly. So, the answer is A.\n"
