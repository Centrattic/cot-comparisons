Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck and put a lot of effort into asking her out, which she accepted. They had a good time together, and the author felt accepted by Beck's friends. But then the author found out that Beck was using the author for her college application by pretending to be nice and then planning to distance herself. The author then stopped Beck from winning an award, leading her to cry and be ostracized.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions. Beck used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely wrong. But when the author retaliated by interfering with the award, that's where the problem is. The question is whether that retaliation was justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions involved deception and possibly unethical behavior to stop Beck from receiving the award. The author might have hacked or provided false information, which is problematic. Also, the consequences of the author's actions caused Beck to cry and the author to become more ostracized. \n\nWhile Beck's actions were hurtful, the author took it upon themselves to take matters into their own hands instead of reporting the situation to authorities or addressing it through proper channels. This could be seen as vigilantism. Even if the author felt wronged, sabotaging someone else's opportunity isn't acceptable. The author's decision to involve friends and family as alibis might also be part of a plan to cover their tracks or manipulate the situation further.\n\nOn the other hand, Beck's manipulation is inexcusable, and the author was a victim. But the question is about the author's actions. In most ethical frameworks, retaliating with harmful actions isn't considered the right approach, even if the initial wrongdoing was severe. The author might feel justified, but from an objective standpoint, they crossed a line by intentionally harming Beck's chances and causing emotional distress.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because their response was not appropriate and caused harm. The correct answer is A.\n"
