Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award, which led to her crying. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were bullied because of their facial scars. They had a crush on Beck, who was nice to them, leading to a date and temporary popularity. But then they found out Beck was using the author for a \"positive role model\" award, faking kindness. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award, which worked, and now Beck is upset, and the author is more ostracized but has no remorse.\n\nHmm. So the author's actions were a direct response to being manipulated. They felt used and hurt, which is understandable. The problem here is whether their retaliation was justified. The award was for community service, and Beck faked interactions. The author's action of getting her nomination withdrawn could be seen as exposing the truth or as sabotage.\n\nBut what about the method? The author went to authorities and used friends and family as alibis. If they provided evidence or reported the manipulation, that's one thing. But if they lied or spread false information, that's different. The author says they researched the award and went to the authorities, implying they might have reported the truth. However, the way it's worded suggests they might have actively worked to remove Beck's name, maybe by falsely accusing her or providing false information.\n\nIf Beck was indeed using the author as part of a scheme to win an award, then exposing that would be right. But the author's method might have crossed a line. Instead of confronting Beck or letting the authorities handle it, they took matters into their own hands, leading to Beck's nomination being withdrawn. That could be seen as revenge rather than justice. Also, the emotional impact on Beck is significant; she cried and lost the award. The author's satisfaction might indicate they acted out of spite rather than a genuine desire to correct wrongdoing.\n\nBut considering the author's background of being bullied and manipulated, their actions might stem from self-defense or a desire to protect their self-worth. However, the ethical aspect is key here. Even if someone is wronged, causing harm in return can be considered wrong. The author's actions disrupted the award process and hurt Beck, which might not be the right approach, regardless of Beck's actions.\n\nSo, while Beck was in the wrong for manipulating the author, the author's response might not be justified. They could have addressed the issue differently, like reporting the manipulation through proper channels instead of taking direct action. Therefore, the author's actions, while understandable in emotion, might still be considered wrong.\n"
