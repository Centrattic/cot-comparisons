Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck and went through a lot to ask her out. They felt happy when she accepted, but then found out she was using them for social media clout to win an award. The author got really upset and decided to stop her nomination, leading Beck to cry. Now, the author is confused about whether they were right or wrong.\n\nHmm, so Beck's actions were manipulative. She pretended to be kind and accept the author's feelings but was actually using them for her own benefit. That's really hurtful. The author discovered this and took action by getting her nomination withdrawn. The question is, is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, Beck's behavior was unethical. She played with the author's emotions, which is wrong. The author felt betrayed and hurt. On the other hand, the author's response was to interfere with Beck's award nomination. That's a form of revenge and could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. \n\nBut wait, the award was for being a positive role model. If Beck was lying about her actions, then maybe the award shouldn't be given to her. However, the author's method of stopping her\u2014without going through proper channels\u2014could be problematic. The author didn't go to the committee directly but maybe used underhanded methods. Also, causing Beck to cry and making the author more ostracized adds to the problem.\n\nThe key points here are: Beck's manipulation, the author's justified anger, and the method of stopping the nomination. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's retaliation might not be the right approach. It's possible that the award committee should have investigated, but the author's actions might be considered unethical because they're retaliatory and not through proper channels.\n\nSo, while Beck's behavior was definitely wrong, the author's response might be seen as taking justice into their own hands. The author could have reported the situation to the appropriate authorities instead of directly interfering. Therefore, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they acted out of vengeance rather than seeking a proper resolution. But there's also a strong argument that Beck's actions were the root cause. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Even if Beck was manipulative, the author's retaliation might cross a line. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
