Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who has been bullied due to facial scars, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. He went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and they had a nice time. But then he found out that Beck was using their relationship for an award, pretending to be kind to him to boost her college application. The author then actively tried to stop her from winning the award, which led to Beck crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Beck manipulated the author by creating a fake relationship to gain social media clout and an award. That's definitely unethical and possibly exploitative. The author was genuinely trying to form a real connection, which was broken when he discovered the deception. The emotional pain of being used like that is significant, especially for someone who's already been bullied and struggled with self-esteem.\n\nNow, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's nomination. Legally, interfering with an award nomination might be tricky, but the bigger question is morality. The author felt betrayed and hurt, so his actions were a reaction to being manipulated. However, even if someone is wronged, does that justify retaliating in a way that harms the other person? \n\nThe author's actions had consequences: Beck was disqualified and cried, while the author became more ostracized. But the author claims no remorse, feeling satisfied because he stopped her from exploiting him. From a moral standpoint, revenge can be seen as a cycle that perpetuates harm. Even if Beck's actions were wrong, the author's retaliation might not be the right approach. However, the context of the author's history of bullying and being used could add nuance. \n\nBut ethical considerations often involve the intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to stop Beck from benefiting from a lie, which could be seen as justified. However, the method involved actively undermining her, which can be seen as revenge. The question is whether stopping her from an award is a fair response. \n\nIn summary, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's retaliation might be considered equally problematic. The author's feelings of betrayal and the desire for justice are understandable, but taking matters into one's own hands to sabotage someone else can lead to a cycle of harm. So, even if Beck deserved it, the author's actions could be ethically questionable. But given the context, it's a complex situation. I'm torn between the two perspectives, but morally, the author's action might be seen as wrong because it's a form of retaliation, even if the motivation was justified.\n"
