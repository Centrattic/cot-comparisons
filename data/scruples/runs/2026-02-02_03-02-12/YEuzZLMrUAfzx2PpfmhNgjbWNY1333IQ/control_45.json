Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's been through a lot with bullying due to facial scars, had a crush on a girl named Beck. He went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and they had a good time. But then he found out that Beck was using their relationship for a \"positive role model\" award. She made posts that were supposedly kind but were actually part of a plan to win the award, and then she and her friends were going to distance themselves after March.\n\nThe author then decided to stop her from winning the award by getting her nomination withdrawn. Now, Beck is crying, and the author feels no remorse, but others are saying he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Beck's actions were clearly manipulative and deceitful. She used the author's feelings to boost her own college application, which is pretty selfish and hurtful. That's definitely wrong on her part. The author was genuinely hurt and felt betrayed, which is understandable given his history of being bullied.\n\nBut the question is whether the author's retaliation makes him wrong. He took an active step to sabotage her award nomination. Even if she deserved it, is it right for him to take matters into his own hands? The author might have felt justified because Beck used him, but does that make his actions okay?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, revenge can be problematic. Even if someone wrongs you, retaliating can cause further harm. The author's actions led to Beck crying and facing consequences, which might be seen as harsh. However, Beck's actions were also harmful, so there's a balance here.\n\nLegally, maybe there's no issue, but morally, the author could be seen as wrong because he intentionally caused harm to someone else, even if that person was at fault. It's about whether the ends justify the means. The author wanted to stop Beck from lying about being a positive role model, but his method involved undermining her, which might not be the right approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was emotionally manipulated and might not have felt like he had support. His actions were a reaction to being used, which could be seen as self-defense in a way. But still, hurting someone else, even if they hurt you first, is usually considered wrong in ethical terms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were probably wrong. Even though Beck was in the wrong, the author's retaliation might not be justified. The right approach would have been to address the betrayal without causing further harm. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong)."
