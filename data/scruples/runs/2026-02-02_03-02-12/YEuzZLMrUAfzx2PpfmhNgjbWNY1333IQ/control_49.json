Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck, who they thought was kind. They went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. Then they found out that Beck had been faking kindness for social media to win an award. The author was hurt, did some research, and then somehow got her nomination withdrawn. Now Beck is crying, and the author has no remorse.\n\nSo the key points are: the author took action based on finding out Beck's deception. They used their friend and family as alibis, which might be part of their method. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, Beck used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely unethical. The author felt betrayed and hurt. But on the other hand, retaliating by sabotaging her award nomination could be seen as going too far. Even if Beck did something wrong, the author's method of response might involve unethical actions, like contacting the committee and getting her nomination withdrawn without proper channels. That could be considered an act of revenge rather than a just response.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're now ostracized, but they don't feel remorse. The situation is complicated by the author's own history of being bullied, which might influence their actions. But regardless of that, sabotaging someone else's award nomination is likely not the right way to handle betrayal.\n\nThe award committee might have their own processes for handling such issues. The author didn't go through the proper channels, which could be a problem. Even if Beck's actions were deceitful, the author's retaliation might have caused harm beyond just addressing the initial wrong. Beck was harmed emotionally, and the author is now facing social consequences too.\n\nSo, considering both sides, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response was also unethical and harmful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for their actions.\n"
