Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who stopped their classmate from winning an award because they felt manipulated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a crush on this girl named Beck, who they thought was genuine. They went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. Then, the author found out that Beck was being kind to him as part of a scheme to get an award, which made him feel used. In response, the author took actions that led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, causing her to cry.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Beck's actions were clearly manipulative and deceitful. She was using the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is wrong. The author discovered this and took steps to stop her from getting the award. The question is, was the author justified in doing so?\n\nOn one hand, Beck's behavior was unethical. But the author's retaliation involved intentionally undermining her, which could be seen as revenge. Even if the author felt wronged, taking actions that harm someone else might not be justified, regardless of the circumstances. It's important to consider whether there were other ways to address the situation without causing direct harm. \n\nThe author mentions feeling ostracized, but they also state they have no remorse. That suggests they might believe their actions were justified. However, the method of stopping Beck by making her cry and withdrawing her award nomination could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The proper course of action might have been to report the manipulation to authorities, but instead, the author took personal action, which might be considered wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions may have caused more harm than good. While Beck was deceitful, the author's response could be seen as an overreaction. The key here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck deserved to lose the award, the author's method of doing so might not be acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while Beck was in the wrong for manipulating the author, the author's actions in retaliation might still be considered wrong because they directly interfered with Beck's award and caused her emotional distress. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
