Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who has been bullied for his facial scars, had a crush on a girl named Beck. She accepted his advances and they had a good time, but then he found out she was using him for her own social media image to win an award. So he sabotaged her nomination, causing her to cry and lose the award.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Beck used the author for her own benefit, making posts that were degrading, knowing he was self-conscious about his appearance. That's pretty harsh and morally wrong. She manipulated both the author and her friends, which is a betrayal of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author decided to retaliate by getting her nomination revoked. Even though she was being manipulative, the author's method involved deliberate sabotage. Whether that's justified depends on the context. The author was hurt and felt betrayed, which is understandable. However, intentionally ruining someone's chances at an award, even if they deserved it, might be considered a harsh response.\n\nBut wait, the award was supposed to be for being a \"positive role model.\" If Beck was using people and manipulating situations for her own gain, then maybe she wasn't a good role model to begin with. The author's action could be seen as exposing her, but doing it by contacting the committee directly might be seen as undermining the process. However, given Beck's deceit, the author might feel justified in protecting himself and exposing her.\n\nThe key points here are Beck's manipulation and the author's response. While Beck's actions were definitely in the wrong, the author's retaliation could be seen as taking matters into his own hands. But considering the emotional harm Beck caused, some might argue that the author was defending himself from further exploitation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because Beck's behavior was unethical. However, the author's method of stopping her could have consequences, like creating a cycle of retaliation. But given the context of the abuse Beck subjected him to, the author's actions might be seen as a justified response for self-respect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because sabotaging someone's award, even if they're manipulative, is not the right approach. But others might say B (not in the wrong) because Beck was the initial wrongdoer. It's a tough call. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Since the author had the right to feel wronged and took action against someone who was exploiting him, maybe the answer is B. But traditionally, taking revenge is often seen as morally wrong. Hmm.\n"
