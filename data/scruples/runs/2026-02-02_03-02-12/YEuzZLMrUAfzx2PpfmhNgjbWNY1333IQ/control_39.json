Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 17 and has facial scars from an accident, was really into this girl named Beck. He went through a lot of trouble to ask her out, got a song written, bought her favorite chocolate, and they actually had a nice time. But then he found out that Beck had been using him for her social media image to win an award. She made posts that looked like they were about him to seem like a positive role model, but it was all fake. Her friend told the author the truth, and he got really upset.\n\nThe author then went to the authorities to check if Beck was nominated for the award, found a Facebook page about it, and somehow got her nomination withdrawn. Now Beck is crying and the author is getting more ostracized at school, but he feels no remorse.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, Beck used the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely manipulative and inconsiderate. That's on her. But when the author discovered this, he took action to stop her from winning the award. That's the key point here. The author's action led to Beck being withdrawn from the award and her crying. \n\nNow, is the author justified in ruining her chances for the award? Well, Beck's actions were unethical, but when the author decided to retaliate, he might have crossed a line. Using the information he had to interfere with her nomination could be considered an act of revenge, even if it was in response to being manipulated. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone wrongs you, retaliating in a way that harms them could be seen as wrong because it's not addressing the issue constructively. The author could have confronted Beck directly, perhaps ended the relationship, reported her actions to the appropriate authorities without taking matters into his own hands, or sought support from someone else. Instead, he chose to sabotage her nomination, which affected her chances for the award. \n\nAlso, the author's intent was to stop her from winning by using the information he had. Whether he had the right to do that is questionable. If the award committee had the mechanisms to check for fraudulent nominations, maybe they would have found out on their own. But the author's involvement might have been unnecessary and could be seen as an overreaction.\n\nMoreover, the author is now facing more ostracization at school, but he has no remorse. This suggests that he believes his actions were justified. However, the emotional impact on Beck and the potential damage to her application might not be balanced by his own feelings of satisfaction. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while Beck's actions were definitely wrong, the author's response might not be the right approach. The question is whether retaliation is justified. In many ethical frameworks, revenge is not considered a morally acceptable response. Instead, addressing the issue through appropriate channels (like talking to Beck, or reporting to the award committee if there was a proper process) would be better. \n\nSo even though Beck used him, the author's decision to sabotage her nomination could be seen as wrong because it perpetuates a cycle of harm and doesn't resolve the issue constructively. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
