Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is pretty intense. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with Beck, who was using the author for social media clout to win an award. Beck's friend told the author that Beck had planned to distance herself after a certain date. The author, feeling betrayed, decided to investigate and found out that Beck was nominated for the award. They then went to the authorities to withdraw her nomination, which worked, and Beck cried. The author feels justified but is facing backlash.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck did manipulate the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely unethical and hurtful. The author was vulnerable because of their past trauma (the accident and bullying). On the other hand, the author's response was to interfere with Beck's award nomination. Even if Beck was being manipulative, did the author have the right to take that action?\n\nLegally, maybe not. Destroying someone's nomination could be seen as a form of sabotage. Emotionally, Beck might have been in the wrong, but the author's actions could be considered retaliatory. The author's friend and family helped confirm the nomination, so there's a group involved here. Also, the author is now being ostracized, which adds to the conflict.\n\nBut the author's motivation was revenge for being used. They were hurt and felt deceived. However, the method they chose to respond might not be the best. Instead of confronting Beck directly or reporting the manipulation through appropriate channels, they chose to undermine Beck's award. That could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. However, given Beck's manipulation, maybe the author's actions were a result of the emotional damage they suffered.\n\nThe key points are intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to retaliate against someone who used them. But the action of stopping someone from winning an award is a significant step. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions could harm Beck's opportunities. But Beck's actions were also harmful to the author's emotional well-being.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, people might differ. Some might say the author was justified because Beck was manipulative, while others might say the author's actions were wrong because they took revenge. The author's actions led to Beck crying, which is a negative outcome, but Beck's actions led to the author's emotional distress first.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. Since Beck's actions were unethical and hurtful, but the author's response was also harmful, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's action of sabotaging the award might not be the right way to handle it. It's more about the method rather than the intent. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even if Beck was at fault, sabotaging her award is not an appropriate response. Alternatively, if we consider the context of the emotional trauma, some might see it as justified. But generally, taking revenge in this way is usually seen as wrong.\n"
