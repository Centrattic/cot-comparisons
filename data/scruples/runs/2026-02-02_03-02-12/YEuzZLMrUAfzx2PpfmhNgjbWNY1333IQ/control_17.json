Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on Beck, who was nice to him initially. Then Beck's friend told the author that Beck was using their kindness for a social media image and a college award. The author then intentionally tried to stop Beck from winning the award, leading to her crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken by the author. Beck supposedly manipulated the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong. But then the author took it upon themselves to sabotage Beck's award nomination. The question is whether that response was justified.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were selfish and hurtful. She used the author's feelings to boost her own image, which is manipulative. The author felt betrayed and hurt, which is understandable. But on the other hand, the author's retaliation involved going to the authorities and getting Beck's nomination withdrawn. This is a pretty serious action. Even if Beck did something wrong, the author didn't go through the proper channels to address the issue. Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which could be seen as vigilantism. \n\nAlso, the author's actions led to Beck crying and the author becoming more ostracized. The author claims they have no remorse, but their actions have consequences for others. While Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. The correct approach would be to talk to Beck directly or seek help through proper channels, not to sabotage someone's award. \n\nIn terms of ethics, taking revenge often isn't considered the right thing to do, even if the person was wronged. So even though Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions might still be considered wrong because of the method used. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. They should have addressed the issue differently rather than retaliating in a harmful way.\n"
