Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award, leading her to cry. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on a girl named Beck. They went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then the author found out that Beck was using the relationship for a \"positive role model\" award. The author felt manipulated and decided to stop her nomination, which led to her crying and being ostracized.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Beck's actions were deceitful. She made the author feel accepted but was only using them for her own benefit. That's really hurtful and unethical. The author was vulnerable and had a history of bullying, which makes exploitation even worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to interfere with Beck's award nomination. The method they used\u2014checking the nomination list and having friends withdraw support\u2014might be seen as underhanded. While Beck's actions were wrong, the author's retaliation could be considered a form of revenge. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, the author might not have done anything illegal, but ethically, it's tricky. The author was hurt and angry, and the response was to take away Beck's award. However, the author's actions might have been a way to reclaim power after being manipulated. Beck was using the author for her own gain, and the author's actions, while harsh, could be seen as a reaction to being used.\n\nBut the author's method of stopping the nomination could be problematic. Instead of confronting Beck directly or reporting the situation through proper channels, they chose to sabotage her award. That could be seen as crossing a line, even if Beck was in the wrong. The author might have had valid reasons for feeling betrayed, but the response could be considered vindictive.\n\nHowever, considering the emotional distress the author experienced and the fact that Beck was exploiting a vulnerable person, some might argue that the author's actions were justified. It's a complex situation where both parties acted immorally, but the author's retaliation might be seen as a consequence of being manipulated.\n\nIn the end, while Beck's actions were clearly unethical, the author's decision to interfere with the award nomination might still be considered wrong because it's a form of retaliation that could harm Beck's opportunities. However, given the context of manipulation and exploitation, there's a strong argument that the author was acting in self-defense or to prevent further exploitation. The answer might depend on whether the means justify the ends. But typically, sabotaging someone's achievements, even if they were wrong, is not considered the right approach. So, leaning towards yes, the author is in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
