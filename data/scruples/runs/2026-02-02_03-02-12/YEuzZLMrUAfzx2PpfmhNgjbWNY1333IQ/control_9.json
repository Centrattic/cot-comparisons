Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a crush on Beck, who they thought was kind. Beck accepted their efforts, but then the author found out that Beck was using the author for her own benefit to win an award. Beck's friend told the author that Beck was being nice as part of a strategy to get more community service hours for her college application. The author then took action to have Beck's nomination withdrawn, leading Beck to cry and the author now being ostracized.\n\nSo, the author's actions were based on feeling betrayed. They discovered that Beck was manipulating them for her own gain. The author's motivations were hurt and anger from being used. But does that justify their actions?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, sabotaging someone's award nomination, even if the person was being deceptive, is generally considered wrong. It's a form of retaliation that harms the other person. The author might feel justified because Beck was deceitful, but that doesn't make the retaliation right. \n\nOn the other hand, Beck was indeed using the author's feelings for personal gain, which is unethical. However, the author's response of ruining Beck's chances at an award and causing her emotional distress is also harmful. Both parties made mistakes, but the author's action was intentional sabotage, which is a serious offense.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author took it upon themselves to punish her, which isn't typically accepted in society. Authorities or institutions are supposed to handle such things, not individuals taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they engaged in unethical behavior to retaliate against Beck. Even if Beck was manipulative, the author's choice to interfere with her award nomination is not acceptable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
