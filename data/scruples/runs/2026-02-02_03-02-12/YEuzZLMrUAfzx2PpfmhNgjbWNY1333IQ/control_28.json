Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the author had a crush on a girl named Beck, asked her out, and they had a good time. But then the author found out that Beck was using their relationship to boost her social media presence and win an award. In response, the author intentionally stopped her from winning the award, leading her to cry. Now the author is being criticized, and they're confused about whether they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Beck's actions involved manipulating the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely unethical and hurtful. The author discovered this betrayal and took action to prevent her from getting the award. The question is whether the author's retaliation was justified.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's behavior was deceitful and used the author's emotions, which is a serious issue. The author was hurt and felt betrayed, which is understandable. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's nomination, which could be seen as taking revenge. Even if Beck was in the wrong, intentionally harming someone else's opportunities, especially in a way that causes emotional distress, isn't typically considered acceptable. The author's actions led to Beck crying and the author becoming more ostracized, which complicates things.\n\nBut there's also the context of the author's past trauma\u2014facial scars, bullying, and being mistreated. That might explain why the betrayal hit so hard. However, while empathy is important, that doesn't excuse retaliatory actions. The author's family and others might have supported them, but using that as a justification for sabotage isn't valid. The award was likely meant to recognize genuine positive contributions, and if Beck was faking kindness, then maybe the award shouldn't have been given to her. However, the author's method of stopping her was to interfere with the process, which might be unethical.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if Beck was being manipulative, the author's actions of withdrawing her nomination could be seen as a form of revenge or vigilantism. The proper response would be to report the manipulation to the authorities or let the award committee handle it. The author's actions caused Beck emotional pain and possibly damaged her chances, which could be considered wrong regardless of the circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while Beck's actions were definitely wrong, the author's retaliation might be in the wrong as well because they took matters into their own hands instead of addressing it through appropriate channels. The author's actions, though perhaps driven by hurt and betrayal, still caused harm and could be seen as unethical. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
