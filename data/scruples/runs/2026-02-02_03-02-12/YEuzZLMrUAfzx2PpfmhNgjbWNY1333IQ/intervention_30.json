Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is complicated.\n\nThe main points are that the author had a crush on a girl named Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and they had a good time. But then Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the author for her own benefit, wanting to win an award by pretending to be kind. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, leading to Beck crying and the author facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Beck's actions were clearly manipulative and deceitful. She used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is wrong. The author discovered this betrayal and took steps to expose it, leading to the award being withdrawn. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for stopping Beck. The author's actions were a response to being manipulated. However, intentionally interfering with someone else's award and causing them emotional distress might be considered unethical, even if the original actions were wrong. \n\nBut the context is important. The author was a victim of manipulation and emotional abuse. They were used as a prop for Beck's college application. The author's actions could be seen as a form of self-defense or retaliation. However, is it right to sabotage someone's award, even if they deserve it? \n\nIn some cases, retaliatory actions can be justified if they prevent further harm, but this is a gray area. The author's actions might be seen as revenge, which isn't always justifiable. But given Beck's deceit and the emotional impact on the author, it's understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's method of stopping Beck involved contacting the authorities and providing evidence. If the author had legitimate proof that Beck's actions were unethical, then reporting it might be the right course of action. But if the author fabricated evidence or lied, that's different. The post says they found the Facebook page and had alibis, so if that's true, they were exposing the truth.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were a response to being wronged. While the method might be questionable, the motive was to correct a wrong. However, the emotional impact on Beck is significant. Still, Beck's initial betrayal was more harmful. \n\nBut the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions were to uncover the truth and prevent the award from going to someone who didn't deserve it, then maybe not in the wrong. However, if the author acted out of spite without proper evidence, then yes. The post suggests the author did their homework, so maybe it's justified.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often take sides based on the moral of the story. The author was the victim, and stopping the award could be seen as a justified action. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
