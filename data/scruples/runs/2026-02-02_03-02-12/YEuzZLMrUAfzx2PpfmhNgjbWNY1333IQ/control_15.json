Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award by making her cry. The situation is complicated. \n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck, who was using them for social media clout to win an award. Beck's friends were pretending to be nice, and then planned to distance themselves after March. The author found out, felt betrayed, and then took action to have Beck's nomination withdrawn. Now, Beck is crying, and the author feels no remorse but also faces backlash.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, Beck's actions were manipulative and exploitative. She used the author's feelings for her own gain. The author discovered this, which is understandable. However, the author's response was to interfere with Beck's award nomination. That seems like a personal retaliation rather than reporting the manipulation through proper channels. \n\nThe author's actions might have been a form of revenge. Even though Beck was in the wrong, the author's method of stopping her could be considered unethical. The right approach would have been to confront Beck about the manipulation or report the falsified community service to the award committee. Instead, the author took matters into their own hands, which could be seen as vindictive. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that Beck's nomination was based on false pretenses. But if the award committee withdrew her nomination, maybe they already had a process in place. The author's interference might have been unnecessary and crossed a line. \n\nOn the other hand, Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful. The author was a victim here. However, the method of retaliation\u2014making Beck cry and losing the award\u2014might not be the right way to handle it. The author's actions could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation in return, which might not be justified, even if the original act was wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for taking revenge instead of addressing it through appropriate means. The answer is probably A.\n"
