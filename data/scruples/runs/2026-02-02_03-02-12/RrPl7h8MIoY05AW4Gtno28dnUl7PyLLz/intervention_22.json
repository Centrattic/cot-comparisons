I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The author is 21, and their family is having financial issues. They've agreed to pay $700 a month for rent and money they owe. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures to keep track, but they're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mom, and damage trust.\n\nHmm, the author is concerned about trust and honesty. But they're also trying to be responsible. So, is there a right or wrong here? Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author is an adult and in a financial agreement with their parents. It's reasonable for them to want documentation to avoid misunderstandings, especially if there's a history of financial issues. Keeping a log is a responsible financial practice. It's not like they're accusing their parents of being dishonest; they just want a record for themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is worried about how their parents might take it. Maybe they see it as a lack of trust. But the author's intention is to maintain accountability, not to imply dishonesty. If done respectfully, like explaining it's for their own records and not a distrust, it should be okay. \n\nThe key points here are the author's age (21, so an adult), the agreement being mutual, the financial situation of the family, and the author's desire to be responsible. There's no indication that the parents are trying to avoid the payments or that the author is being controlling. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a proactive step to manage their finances responsibly. The potential issue is more about communication. They need to approach it in a way that reassures their parents it's not about distrust but about keeping things clear for everyone. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
