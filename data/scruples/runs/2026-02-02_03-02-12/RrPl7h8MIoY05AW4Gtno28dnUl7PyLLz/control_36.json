I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and owed money. They want to keep a log with signatures but are worried about offending their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are offering the upstairs apartment but the person prefers the lower floor. The payment is part of a financial agreement. The key points are about trust, responsibility, and how to approach this without causing offense.\n\nThe person wants to document payments, which is a responsible action to ensure clarity and avoid disputes. However, they're concerned that asking for signatures might be seen as distrustful. The parents are described as honest, so maybe the concern is valid. But is the person in the wrong for wanting to document?\n\nLegally, documenting agreements is usually a good idea. It's not about not trusting the parents but about having a record for both parties. The person's intention is to be responsible, not to accuse. However, the way they approach it could affect how it's received. If done respectfully, it's about mutual understanding rather than distrust.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The person is trying to manage their finances responsibly. They aren't accusing their parents; they're setting up a system that benefits both sides. The parents might have their own reasons for not wanting a log, but the person isn't wrong for wanting to do this. The answer would likely be B (No), because seeking clarity and documentation isn't the fault of the person.\n"
