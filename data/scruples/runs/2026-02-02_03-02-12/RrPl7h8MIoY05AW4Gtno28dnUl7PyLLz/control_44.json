I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a log of payments to their parents and asking for signatures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to document the payments with a log and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and potentially damaging trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the intention to document financial transactions, ensuring clarity, maybe to protect themselves if there's a dispute later. But they're concerned about how their parents might react, thinking it could be seen as distrustful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of ethics or social norms, is keeping a record of payments wrong? If the parents are honest and the author is doing this for their own peace of mind, it's a precautionary measure. However, the way it's presented could affect perception. If the parents feel that the author doesn't trust them, that might be an issue. But the author's intention is to maintain responsibility and avoid misunderstandings, which is reasonable.\n\nFinancial transactions, even within families, can sometimes lead to conflicts if not documented. By creating a log, the author is protecting both parties in the long run. However, the method of presenting it is important. If the author approaches it in a way that's respectful and explains the reasoning, it's less likely to be offensive. The author is worried about being an \"asshole,\" so they are considering the parents' feelings, which is good.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting responsibly by documenting the payments. It's a practical step to ensure clarity. The mistake might be in how they present it, but the intention itself isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
