I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and owed money. They want to keep a log with signatures. The parent offered the upstairs apartment, but the person prefers the lower floor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by wanting to document payments.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to track payments. This could be out of a sense of responsibility or maybe a lack of trust. The parents are in a tough financial situation, so maybe there's pressure. The author is concerned about offending, especially the mother, and feels it might affect trust.\n\nIn many cultures, keeping a written record of financial transactions is a normal practice to avoid misunderstandings. Even with trust, documentation can prevent disputes. The author isn't trying to accuse the parents of anything, just ensuring clarity. Since the payments involve a specific amount each month, having a log makes sense. The parents offered the apartment, so maybe the arrangement is more formal than informal. \n\nHowever, the concern is about offending. The author should approach this respectfully. Maybe they can explain it's for their own clarity and accountability, not to imply distrust. If the parents agree to sign, it shows they're comfortable with the arrangement. The key is the intent: the author is being responsible, not being disrespectful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
