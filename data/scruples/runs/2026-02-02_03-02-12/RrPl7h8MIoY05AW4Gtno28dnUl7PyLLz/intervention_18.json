I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and has agreed to pay their parents $700 each month for rent and owed money. They want to keep a log with signatures from both sides. The parent offered the upstairs apartment, but the user prefers the lower floor room.\n\nFirst, the user is concerned about financial responsibility. They want a record to ensure transparency. The parents are described as honest, but the user has a gut feeling that documentation is necessary. The user is worried it might offend their mom, especially since it could affect the trust they have.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the user is trying to be responsible, wants a clear record, and is being cautious without assuming the worst. The parents are in a financial situation that's rough, so maybe the user is also trying to make sure that their contributions are properly acknowledged. The user is asking how to do this without being an asshole, which shows they're being considerate of their parents' feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical here. They're setting boundaries and ensuring accountability, which is a reasonable approach, especially when dealing with family. The author isn't accusing the parents of dishonesty but is taking proactive steps to protect themselves. The concern about offending the mother is valid, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. It's about how to approach the situation respectfully.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're being responsible and trying to maintain trust while ensuring their payments are properly tracked.\n"
