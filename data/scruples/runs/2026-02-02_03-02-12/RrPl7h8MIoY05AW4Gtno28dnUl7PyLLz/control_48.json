I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for their signatures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially their mom, and feel it might affect trust. The question is whether they're wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need for documentation. The parents offered the upstairs apartment, but the author prefers the lower floor. The author is concerned about trust and potential offense.\n\nNow, considering the options\u2014A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. Let's break it down. \n\nIn many cases, when there's a financial arrangement between family members, especially when one is an adult, documentation is a practical step to prevent misunderstandings. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They're trying to be responsible. The parents are aware of the payments since they agreed to the arrangement. \n\nHowever, the author is right to consider their parents' feelings. Family dynamics can be sensitive. Requiring a signature might feel like a lack of trust, but the author's intention is responsibility, not distrust. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong in wanting to document the payments. The issue is more about how to approach it without causing offense. The answer would likely be B\u2014author isn't in the wrong. They are taking a responsible step, even if it's a delicate situation. The problem isn't with the action itself but how to communicate it.\n"
