I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and ask for their signatures. The author is 21, contributing $700 a month to their parents, who are offering an apartment but the author prefers a lower floor room. They're concerned about financial responsibility and the potential for mistrust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between family members. The parents are being generous by allowing the author to stay and even offering the upstairs apartment. The author is trying to formalize the payments, which could be seen as necessary for accountability, especially if there are financial difficulties. However, family relationships can be sensitive when it comes to money. The author's desire for a written log isn't about distrust but about ensuring transparency and record-keeping. \n\nIn many situations, having a written agreement is responsible, especially when dealing with money. It prevents misunderstandings and serves as evidence if disputes arise. The parents are described as honest, but formalizing the arrangement doesn't necessarily imply distrust. However, the author is right to be cautious about how it might be perceived, particularly by the mother. The key is approaching it respectfully, explaining the reason for the log (like for their own records or for the family's business records), and ensuring both parties are comfortable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document the payments. They're taking a proactive step to protect themselves and maintain clarity. The potential issue is more about how it's communicated rather than the action itself. Therefore, the correct answer is B (No).\n"
