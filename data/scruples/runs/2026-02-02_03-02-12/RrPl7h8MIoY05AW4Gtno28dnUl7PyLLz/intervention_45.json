I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents.\n\nSo the author is 21, paying $700 a month to their parents as rent and for other money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures from both sides. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need for documentation, possibly due to financial difficulties in the family.\n\nThe main concern here is about trust. The author is worried that creating a log might offend their mother or seem like they don't trust their parents. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for wanting a log. The author mentions a \"gut feeling\" that they should record payments. This could be a precaution to avoid misunderstandings, especially if there's a possibility of disputes later. Even if the parents are honest, having a written record can prevent issues, especially when money is involved. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about offending their parents or damaging the trust. But is asking for a signed log inherently wrong? If the author approaches it respectfully and explains the reason, maybe to protect everyone's interests, it might be seen as responsible rather than distrustful. \n\nFinancial agreements, even within families, can sometimes lead to conflicts. Having a documented agreement is a common practice to avoid such issues. The author isn't refusing to pay or being disrespectful; they're just seeking clarity and accountability. \n\nThe parents have offered the upstairs apartment but the author prefers the lower room. That might affect the perception of the payments\u2014maybe the parents are allowing them to stay in a specific room for a reason, and the payment is more about the money owed rather than actual rent. But the author's intention is to formalize the payments, which is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are about responsibility and ensuring that both parties have a clear record. It's not about accusing the parents of dishonesty but about protecting all parties involved. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a proactive step to manage a financial arrangement properly.\n"
