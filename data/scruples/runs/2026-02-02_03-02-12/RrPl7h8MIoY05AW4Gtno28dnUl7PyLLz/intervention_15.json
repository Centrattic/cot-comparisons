I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 each month for rent and owed money. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially the mother, and question if it's an issue of trust.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and family dynamics. The author is trying to be responsible by documenting payments, which is a common practice in financial transactions to avoid misunderstandings. However, since this is within a family, there's a potential for it to be perceived as distrust, even if that's not the intention.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some families, formalizing payments like this might be normal, while in others, it could be seen as unnecessary or even distrustful. The parents are described as honest, so maybe the author is just being cautious. But the author's motivation is to protect themselves, which is valid. \n\nIs keeping a log inherently wrong? Probably not. It's a way to ensure clarity and prevent future disputes. The issue might be how it's approached. If the author explains the reason calmly and respectfully, it's less likely to offend. The problem is more about communication than the act itself.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document payments. The answer should be B (No).\n"
