I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, living with their parents, and paying them $700 a month. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures to track payments. They're worried about offending their parents, especially their mom, and whether it's a responsible move or if it's undermining trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are: family dynamics, financial responsibility, and trust. The person is concerned about their parents' financial situation and wants to ensure payments are properly recorded. But there's a concern about how this might be perceived. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. In these kinds of situations, the main factors are whether the action is reasonable and respectful. The author's intention is to be responsible, not to distrust their parents. Creating a log could prevent misunderstandings or disputes in the future, especially if there's a financial strain. However, it's important to approach this sensitively to avoid hurting feelings, especially in a family context.\n\nIn many cases, documentation can be a good practice, even within families. It's about setting clear boundaries and expectations. The author is not being confrontational but is seeking a way to manage their finances responsibly. However, the way they present it might affect how their parents receive it. The author's concern about offending their mother is valid, so they need to communicate this carefully.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family trust. The answer would likely be B (No), as their actions are well-intentioned and responsible, even if there's a need to handle the communication thoughtfully.\n"
