I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do\" question is in the wrong by wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and having them sign it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and owed money. They want to keep a record with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mother, and question if it's undermining trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to document financial transactions isn't inherently wrong. It's a way to ensure both parties have a clear record, which can prevent misunderstandings. The parents are described as honest, but there's a financial arrangement here. The author feels a \"gut feeling\" to record the payments, which suggests they might be anxious about potential issues, even if their parents are trustworthy.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intent is responsible, to maintain records. The concern is about offending the parents by implying distrust. However, the author is trying to be responsible and might be proactive in maintaining transparency. \n\nIn many situations, documenting such agreements is a standard practice, especially when money is involved. The author isn't accusing the parents of anything, just creating a log. The act of asking for a signature could be seen as a formality rather than a lack of trust. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. Parents might feel that their honesty is being questioned. The author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family trust. \n\nSo, is it wrong? Probably not. The author is taking a responsible step to manage their finances. The parents' reaction might be more about sensitivity than the author being in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author's actions are about responsibility and documentation, not distrust.\n"
