I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The author is 21, and they've agreed to pay $700 a month to their parents for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures, but they're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mother. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, 21, and financially responsible. They're making payments to their parents, which is a transactional agreement. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need for a record. That's probably because they want to avoid misunderstandings or disputes, which is a common reason to document financial transactions. \n\nNow, whether it's wrong to ask for a signature. In financial matters between adults, even family, documentation is a standard practice. It's about accountability and clarity. The author isn't accusing the parents of anything; they just want a record. The parents might feel it's unnecessary because they trust each other, but the author's request is about their own peace of mind. \n\nPossible concerns: The parents might perceive it as distrust. The author is aware of that and is seeking advice on how to do it without being offensive. The key here is how the author approaches the situation. If they explain it as a personal responsibility measure rather than a lack of trust, it might be received better. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're acting out of responsibility and not suspicion, then probably not. They're not assuming dishonesty, just wanting a record. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The action is about being proactive in financial management, which is reasonable, especially when dealing with money between family members.\n"
