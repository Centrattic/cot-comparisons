I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the original post (OP) is in the wrong for wanting to log their rent payments to their parents and get their signatures.\n\nFirst, the OP is 21 and has a financial agreement with their parents. They're paying $700 a month for rent and money owed. The parents offered the upstairs apartment, but the OP prefers the lower floor. The main issue is whether keeping a log and asking for signatures is wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility versus trust. The OP feels it's responsible to document the payments, maybe to avoid misunderstandings if there's a financial issue later. But they're worried about offending their parents, especially their mother, which makes sense because families can take such things personally. \n\nThe parents are described as honest, so the OP might feel that this log isn't about distrust but about accountability. However, in family dynamics, even if it's well-intentioned, it might come off as a lack of trust. The OP is trying to balance being responsible without hurting family relations.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? Well, wanting to have a record isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical step to ensure clarity. However, the way they approach it matters. If they handle it with care, explaining that it's for everyone's benefit and not a reflection of distrust, it could be okay. The intention here is responsible, so the answer would likely be B (they're not in the wrong). But the execution needs to be sensitive to avoid offending the parents.\n"
