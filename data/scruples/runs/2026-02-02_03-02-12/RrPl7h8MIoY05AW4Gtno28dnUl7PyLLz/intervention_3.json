I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original situation is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking them to sign. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to keep a log with dates, amounts paid, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and about trust.\n\nSo, why might they be right or wrong? Well, on one hand, the parents are described as \"great, honest people,\" but the person feels the need for a log. This could be about maintaining trust or ensuring accountability. The person is being responsible by documenting the payments. However, in a family context, asking parents to sign a log might come across as not trusting them, which could strain the relationship.\n\nThe key points are responsibility vs. trust. The person is trying to be responsible, which is understandable, especially if there's financial strain. But family dynamics can be complex. The parents might feel that the child doesn't trust them, even if the child's intention is good.\n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong because they're trying to manage their finances responsibly. However, the way they approach it might matter. Maybe having an open conversation first would help avoid offending. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong for the intention, not the method, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). They're taking a responsible step, even if it's done carefully to maintain family relations.\n"
