I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and feel it might affect trust.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, trust, and financial responsibility. The person is trying to be responsible by documenting the payments. But they're concerned about how their parents, who they consider honest, might react. They don't want to come off as distrustful.\n\nI should consider if documenting payments is reasonable. In many cases, when people have financial agreements within families, especially when money is involved, having a written record can prevent misunderstandings. It's a common practice even among friends or family to avoid disputes later.\n\nHowever, the concern is about the perception. The parents might see it as a lack of trust. The author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family harmony. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting this documentation.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting responsibly. Financial matters can be sensitive, but setting clear boundaries isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's about protecting both parties. The way they approach it matters\u2014maybe starting with a conversation about why they feel the need for the log and assuring their parents it's to avoid confusion, not distrust.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step that's common in financial agreements, and their approach to not offend is commendable.\n"
