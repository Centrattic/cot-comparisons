I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month as rent and for other money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mother, and feel it might undermine trust.\n\nSo the main question is whether keeping such a log is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the intent here. The person is trying to be responsible and ensure that payments are properly documented, especially since the family is going through financial difficulties. There's a concern about trust, but the person is also being cautious. \n\nIn many cases, when there's a financial arrangement between family members, documentation can prevent misunderstandings. It's not uncommon for people to create agreements or logs, even among family, to keep things clear. The parents are described as honest, so the log isn't about distrust but about accountability. \n\nHowever, the user is worried about offending the parents, which is a valid concern. The way they approach it might matter. If they explain it as a responsible step and not a sign of mistrust, it could be accepted. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not how to approach it.\n\nSince the author's intention is to maintain responsibility and clarity, and given that financial arrangements can be tricky even in trusting relationships, it's reasonable for them to want documentation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking a precautionary measure which is prudent, especially in a financially strained family situation.\n"
