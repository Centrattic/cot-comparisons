I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month.

I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original situation is wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The person is 21, and they've agreed to pay $700 monthly to their parents for rent and owed money. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially their mom, and feel it might affect their trust.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the intent behind the action and the context. The person is trying to be responsible and ensure that all payments are recorded. But they're concerned about how their parents might perceive it. The parents are described as honest, but financial stress can cause issues. The question is whether keeping a log is wrong.\n\nFinancial transparency is generally a good practice, especially in any agreement involving money. Even within families, having a written record can prevent misunderstandings. However, the way it's approached matters. If the person is approaching it with good intentions and not as an accusation, then it's reasonable. They mentioned wanting to avoid being an asshole, so they're aware of the sensitivity.\n\nBut the parents might see it as a lack of trust. The user's gut feeling is that there's a reason to record payments, which could indicate that there's some prior issue or fear of miscommunication. The parents offering the upstairs apartment but the user preferring the lower floor might be a red herring, but it shows that the arrangement isn't fully settled yet.\n\nSo, the person isn't wrong for wanting to document the payments. It's a proactive step to maintain clarity. The problem would arise if the approach is confrontational or if there's an underlying distrust without cause. Since the user is trying to handle it respectfully, they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
