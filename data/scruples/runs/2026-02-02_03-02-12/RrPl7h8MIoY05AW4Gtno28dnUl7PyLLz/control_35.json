I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The person is 21 and has agreed to pay $700 monthly. They want to document each payment with a dated log and get both their and their parents' signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and possibly damaging trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person's parents are going through financial difficulties, and there's a financial agreement in place. The person is being responsible by setting up a structured payment system. The key here is whether keeping a log and requiring a signature is an overstep or a reasonable measure.\n\nOn one hand, the parents are described as honest and trustworthy, so the person might be overcompensating by adding documentation. But on the other hand, the person is young, and establishing clear records for financial transactions is a good practice, especially when money is involved between family members. It can prevent misunderstandings and provide a reference if disputes arise.\n\nThe person is concerned about offending their parents, which is valid. Family dynamics can be sensitive, so the approach matters. The question is whether the act of creating a log and asking for signatures is inherently wrong. Since it's a mutual agreement, documenting it might actually reinforce trust by making both parties accountable.\n\nThe answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because keeping a record of financial transactions is prudent and responsible. The motivation here is to maintain clarity and avoid future conflicts, which is a legitimate reason. The key is how it's presented. If done respectfully, it shouldn't be seen as a lack of trust but as a way to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n"
