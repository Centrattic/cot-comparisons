I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is 21 and wants to keep a log of payments to their parents, including their signatures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is paying their parents $700 a month for rent and debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents and damaging trust. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the author is paying money to their parents, there's no obligation to have a written agreement unless the parents expect it. But the author is concerned about trust. The parents are described as honest, but the author has a gut feeling something might go wrong. Maybe there's been past issues with money, or they're worried about clarity in case of disputes.\n\nThe author is being cautious, which is understandable. But in a family context, adding formal documentation might feel like a breach of trust. However, the author isn't doing this out of distrust but as a responsible step. They want to avoid being an asshole, so their intention is to be fair and clear, not to accuse.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, having a written record can prevent misunderstandings. But emotionally, it could be seen as mistrust. So the author is walking a line between responsibility and family dynamics. Since the author is trying to maintain honesty and ensure clarity, I don't think they're in the wrong. They're taking a proactive step to manage a financial agreement, which is reasonable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
