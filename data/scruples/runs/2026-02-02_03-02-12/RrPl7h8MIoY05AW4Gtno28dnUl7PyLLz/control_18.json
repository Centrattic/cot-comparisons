I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether keeping a log of payments to parents and asking them to sign it is acceptable.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents are described as honest, but the person feels the need to document to avoid issues. The concern is that this might offend the parents, especially the mother, and could affect trust.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The parents offered the apartment, but the person chose a different room. The payment is for rent and owed money. The person isn't doing anything illegal by keeping a record. In fact, documenting financial transactions is a responsible action, especially when money is involved between family members. It can prevent misunderstandings and provide evidence if disputes arise.\n\nHowever, the concern is about trust and potential offense. The parents are described as honest, so maybe the author is overcautious. But it's also common in financial agreements, even within families, to have some form of documentation. The key here is the approach. If the author is upfront about it and explains that it's for everyone's clarity and to avoid future conflicts, it might not be seen as a lack of trust. The way it's presented matters. The author isn't implying the parents are dishonest; they're just being responsible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a proactive step to ensure clarity, which is a good practice. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
