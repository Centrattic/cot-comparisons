I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and ask for their signature.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and about undermining trust. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust, family dynamics, and financial responsibility. The user is trying to document transactions, which is a common practice in financial agreements, even within families. On one hand, it's responsible and can prevent misunderstandings. On the other hand, it might be seen as distrustful, especially if the parents value a more informal, trust-based approach.\n\nI should consider cultural context. In some cultures, documentation is expected even for family transactions. In others, it might be seen as unnecessary or even disrespectful. The parents are described as honest and trustworthy, so the person might be overcompensating for their own anxiety about finances.\n\nThe user's concern about offending their mother is valid. Parents might feel that their trust is being questioned. However, the person's intent is to be responsible, not to accuse. The question is whether the action is inherently wrong or if the approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nMaybe the answer is that the person isn't in the wrong because they're acting responsibly, but they should communicate their reasons clearly to their parents to avoid misunderstandings. So the answer would be B (No), but there's a need for tactful communication.\n"
