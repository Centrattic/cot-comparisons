I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to create a log of these payments with signatures to keep track. They're worried about offending their parents, especially since the parents are described as honest but the user feels the need for documentation.\n\nFirst, is there a right or wrong here? Well, the parents offered the apartment, but the user chose a different room. The payments are agreed upon, but the user is seeking a way to document them. The parents are honest, but the user's gut feeling is that they should record the payments. \n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong for wanting this log. Legally, having a written record of payments is a good practice, especially if there's any ambiguity or if disputes might arise later. It's a way to ensure both parties are on the same page. The user is being proactive about responsibility, which is positive. \n\nBut the user is also concerned about offending the parents, which shows they care about their relationship. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. Since the parents are honest and the user is an adult, creating a simple log isn't about distrust but about clarity. \n\nThe user isn't being confrontational; they're trying to be careful and respectful. There's no indication that the parents are upset about the payments themselves, just the documentation. The user's intention is to maintain trust and honesty, not undermine it. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step that's in line with maintaining both the relationship and financial accountability.\n"
