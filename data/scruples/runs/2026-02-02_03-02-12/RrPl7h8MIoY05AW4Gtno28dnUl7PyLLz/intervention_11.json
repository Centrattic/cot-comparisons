I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and having them sign it. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. The parents offered the upstairs apartment, but the author prefers the lower floor.\n\nThe author feels the need to document the payments because of a gut feeling, maybe to ensure transparency or protect themselves financially. They\u2019re worried this might offend the parents, especially the mother, and question if it's chipping away at trust. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is an adult, and there's a financial arrangement in place. While it's a family matter, the author is trying to formalize something that might otherwise be informal. The parents are described as honest, but the author is being cautious. \n\nIn some cases, documenting financial transactions between family members can prevent misunderstandings. It's a responsible step, especially if there's a possibility of disputes later. However, the way it's approached could affect how it's received. If done respectfully and with clear communication, it might not be an issue. \n\nThe author is concerned about offending their parents. That shows they care about maintaining family harmony. The key is whether the action is reasonable and respectful. Since the author is taking steps to maintain trust and transparency, not to imply distrust, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents feel the need for documentation is a sign of distrust, that could be a point of contention. But the author isn't accusing them of anything; they're just wanting a record. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting responsibly to protect both parties.\n"
