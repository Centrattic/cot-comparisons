I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for their signatures. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person is 21, living at home, and has agreed to pay their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mom, and feel it might undermine trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the appropriateness of documenting financial transactions within a family. Family dynamics can be delicate, and while the person's intention is to be responsible, there's a concern about how it might be perceived.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, keeping records is smart. It ensures clarity and provides a paper trail in case of disputes. However, in a family setting, this can be seen as a lack of trust, which might strain relationships. The parents might feel that the child is treating them like a landlord rather than family, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family trust. They're not being malicious, just cautious. The question is whether they're wrong for doing this. \n\nLegally, if there's a written agreement, it's better, but emotionally and socially, it's a grey area. The parents might not take offense if the approach is respectful and explained properly. The author is trying to be careful, so maybe they're not wrong, but they need to handle it sensitively.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting responsibly by documenting the payments, which is a practical step, especially given their family's financial situation. The key is how they present it. If they explain it as a way to ensure everyone's on the same page rather than distrust, it's a reasonable action. There's no inherent wrongdoing in being proactive about financial accountability, even within a family.\n"
