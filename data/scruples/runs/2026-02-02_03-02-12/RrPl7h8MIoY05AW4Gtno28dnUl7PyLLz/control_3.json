I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month, and wants to create a signed log to track payments. They're worried it might offend their parents or undermine trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents offered the upstairs apartment but the person chose the lower floor. They're paying rent and other debts. The parents are described as honest, but the person feels the need for documentation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate if keeping a log and asking for signatures is a reasonable action or if it's crossing a line. \n\nOn one hand, documenting financial transactions is a responsible step, especially when dealing with family. It can prevent misunderstandings and serve as a record if disputes arise. The person is being proactive about accountability, which can be seen as a positive trait. \n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of family dynamics. Parents might feel that such formality is unnecessary and could take it personally, interpreting it as a lack of trust. The key here is how to approach it without causing offense. The author is aware of this potential issue and is seeking advice on how to do it respectfully, which suggests they're not being inconsiderate. \n\nSince the author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family harmony, it's more about finding a respectful way to implement the log rather than being inherently wrong. The intention is to maintain trust, not to question it. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
