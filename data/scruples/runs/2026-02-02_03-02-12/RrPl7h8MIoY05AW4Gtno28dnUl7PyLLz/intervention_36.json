I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The author is 21, and there's a financial agreement where they pay $700 monthly. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to track payments with a log and signatures to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The author wants to maintain trust but also ensure accountability. Their parents might see the log as a breach of trust since they\u2019re offering the apartment, which is a family matter. However, the author's intention is to be responsible, not to accuse. \n\nFinancial transactions between family members can get complicated. Even if the parents are honest, having a written record can prevent future disputes. The author is proactive in avoiding potential issues, which is a responsible approach. \n\nThe parents might feel offended because it could seem like they're not trusted. But the author's approach is to ask for signatures, which is a mutual agreement. It's not about distrust but about clarity. The key here is communication. If the author explains it as a way to keep everyone on the same page, it might ease their concerns. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're trying to handle a financial arrangement responsibly, which is understandable. The answer should be B (No). They're not wrong for wanting to document the payments to protect both sides.\n"
