I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and has agreed to pay their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and both parties' signatures. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest, but the user feels the need for a written record. That suggests there might be a lack of trust or a desire for accountability. The user is concerned about offending their parents, especially the mother, and possibly undermining trust.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the parents are honest, having a written agreement can be a responsible move. It's not necessarily about distrust but about clarity. Financial arrangements, even within families, can lead to misunderstandings if not documented. The user is trying to be responsible, not to accuse the parents of dishonesty. \n\nHowever, the way it's approached matters. If the user presents it as a mutual agreement and a way to keep things transparent, it might be seen as reasonable. On the other hand, if it's done in a way that implies the parents are untrustworthy, that could cause offense. \n\nThe key is the intention. The user's intention seems to be about responsibility and ensuring that both sides have a clear record. That's not inherently wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) if the approach is respectful and consensual. But if there's an underlying mistrust not based on evidence, that's different. However, the user is being cautious, not accusatory. \n\nSo, the answer is B.\n"
