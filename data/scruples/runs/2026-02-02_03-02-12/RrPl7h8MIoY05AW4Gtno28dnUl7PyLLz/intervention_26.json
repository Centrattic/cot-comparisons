I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and asking them to sign it. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and feel it might affect trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate that. \n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and trust. The author is trying to be responsible by documenting payments. Since the parents have offered the upstairs apartment but the author prefers the lower floor, maybe there's some arrangement about space that's part of the payment. \n\nThe concern is whether this log is a breach of trust. But in many cases, especially when dealing with money between family members, it's common to have some form of record. It's a way to prevent misunderstandings. The author isn't being greedy or exploitative; they're just ensuring that both parties agree on what's been paid. \n\nThe parents are described as honest, but even honest people might have differing memories. A written log can protect both sides. The author is being proactive, not assuming the parents are dishonest, but just covering their bases. \n\nThe worry about offending the mother is valid, but the approach could be handled sensitively. Maybe presenting it as a way to keep things clear and avoid future conflicts rather than implying distrust. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step. The answer should be B.\n"
