My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thought. The situation is in a high school debate team where the author is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm, so the author's motivation was to help them realize their incompatibility, but James blamed them. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to do a favor, as others agreed they were incompatible. But relationships are sensitive. Even if the couple wasn't happy, the author didn't have the right to meddle in their personal lives. The information was obtained through casual talks, which might not be accurate. The author assumed they knew both parties' thoughts, but maybe they misinterpreted or misunderstood. \n\nAlso, relationships often have complexities that outsiders don't see. Even if James and Mary were unhappy, breaking them up could have consequences beyond just debate, like emotional distress. The author might have crossed a boundary by using their position or influence to disrupt a partnership, especially in a competitive setting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions led to the couple being honest with each other. But was it necessary for the author to intervene? Could they have approached it differently, like encouraging the couple to talk to each other instead of revealing the thoughts directly? \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author thought they were helping, but their actions caused immediate harm (James crying, public breakup). In a high school setting, such actions can be seen as overstepping, even if the outcome seemed beneficial. \n\nSo, while the author's intention might have been good, the method of intervention was invasive and potentially harmful. The author didn't respect the couple's privacy and autonomy to address their issues themselves. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal matter without consent, even if the result was a breakup that others approved of. \n\nThe answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because the action of revealing private thoughts without the couple's consent is a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the outcome.\n"
