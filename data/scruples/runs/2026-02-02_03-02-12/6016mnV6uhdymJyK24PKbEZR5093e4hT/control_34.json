My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that the couple isn't actually happy with each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the author's intention and the consequences. The author believed that the couple was incompatible and that the breakup would help them be happier. However, they directly revealed each other's negative opinions, which caused immediate conflict and emotional distress (James was crying). \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by ending a harmful situation. But on the other hand, the couple had a reason to stay together (their debate partnership), and the author's interference might have disrupted that without considering the full context. Even if the couple had issues, it's their relationship to manage. The author might have acted without consent, leading to public embarrassment and emotional harm to James. \n\nThe debate team's reaction (others agreeing it was a favor) is a point, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. Privacy and consent are important factors. The author didn't ask if they wanted to know each other's thoughts, nor did they consider the potential fallout beyond the immediate situation. \n\nIn relationships, even if there are problems, the decision to end it should come from the individuals involved. The author's role was to facilitate their debate partnership, not meddle in their personal lives. The fact that James blamed the author and was emotionally affected shows that the action had negative consequences, regardless of the intention. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by revealing private thoughts without consent, leading to unintended harm, even if the outcome seemed beneficial to some.\n"
