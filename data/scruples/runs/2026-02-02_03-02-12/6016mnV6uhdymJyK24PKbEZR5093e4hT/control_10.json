My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is wrong for breaking up the couple. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is part of a debate team, and their partner Tim is running for co-captains. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The user found out that James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The user then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics here. Was it right for the user to interfere? They had information that each partner thought negatively of the other. Maybe the user thought they were helping by ending an unhappy relationship that was only sustained for strategic reasons. But did they have the right to share that information?\n\nOn one hand, the user might believe they were doing a favor, as others agreed. But on the other hand, relationships are personal, and sharing such information without consent can be seen as a betrayal. Even if the couple was unhappy, the user wasn't in a position to act as a mediator. James was upset and blamed the user, which suggests that the user overstepped.\n\nAlso, the user's motivation might be to eliminate competition for the co-captaincy. There's a potential conflict of interest here. Even if the user's intent was to help, the method was questionable. They didn't try to talk to the couple themselves but instead spread the information, leading to an argument in public. That could be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user caused a public breakup that affected James emotionally. Even if the relationship was doomed, the way it was handled was harsh. The user might have crossed a line by not having the couple confront each other directly instead of inserting themselves into the middle.\n\nSo, considering the ethical implications and the potential for manipulation, even with good intentions, the user probably acted inappropriately. They didn't respect the couple's privacy and decision-making process. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
