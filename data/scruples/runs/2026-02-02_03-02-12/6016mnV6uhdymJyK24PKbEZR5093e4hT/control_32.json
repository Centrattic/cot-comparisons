My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. They're worried about a competing couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other very much but are in the relationship because they need each other for debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's intention and the consequences. The author's reasoning is that James and Mary are incompatible and their relationship is affecting their partnership. They believed that telling them the truth would help them realize they shouldn't be together. But James was upset and blamed the author, while others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, meddling in someone else's relationship can be problematic. Even if the author thought they had good intentions, they didn't have the right to reveal James and Mary's private thoughts without their consent. Relationships are personal, and people usually expect a certain level of privacy. The author might have thought they were helping, but the method of intervention was direct and led to public embarrassment for James. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions did result in the couple breaking up, which some might see as a positive outcome since they were unhappy. However, the author might have overstepped by not seeking a more private or indirect way to address the situation. Maybe they could have talked to each of them separately to let the other person know their thoughts, but that's speculation. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had the right to intervene. Relationships are complex, and even if there's a perceived problem, it's generally up to the people involved to handle their own issues. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust and privacy, which is why James is upset. Even if others agree the breakup was inevitable, the method of intervention was questionable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did the wrong thing by revealing the private thoughts of James and Mary without their consent, leading to a public breakup. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
