My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument. James is upset, but others think the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's action. Was it their place to intervene? They aren't close friends with either James or Mary, just casual conversation partners. By revealing each other's negative opinions, they caused a breakup. Even if the couple was unhappy, is it right to act as a mediator from afar?\n\nThen there's the intent. The author's goal was to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. It seems like their motivation might be self-serving. They might have thought that breaking up the couple would weaken their competition, making it easier for them and their partner to win. Even if the author claims it was to help the couple, the underlying motivation could be manipulative.\n\nAlso, relationships are complex. Just because both partners have issues doesn't mean the author's intervention was the best solution. They could have approached the situation differently, maybe by suggesting the couple talk to each other instead of directly revealing the criticisms. The immediate consequence was a public argument and emotional distress, which raises questions about the method's appropriateness.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author did the right thing by helping the couple realize their incompatibility. If the couple was truly unhappy and staying together for practical reasons, the author might have helped them end a harmful relationship. But the key here is whether the author had the right to meddle in their personal lives without being a close confidant.\n\nThe debate team context adds another layer. Using personal relationships as a strategy in a competition could be seen as underhanded. Even if the author believes they acted in the couple's best interest, the method of using their position to influence the outcome for their own benefit complicates the moral justification.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome might have been positive for the couple in the long run, the author's actions were driven by self-interest and involved meddling in others' private matters without their consent. This makes me think the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own goals over respecting the couple's privacy and autonomy.\n"
