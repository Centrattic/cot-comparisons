My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by telling each other what the other thought. The author is on the debate team and considering running for co-captains with their partner Tim. The competition is this couple, who are from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was crying and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The key points here are the author's intent, the consequences, and the ethical implications of their actions. \n\nFirst, the author's motivation: they were anticipating competition from the couple and thought breaking them up would help their own chances. But they also mention that the couple was unhappy and staying together for the sake of debate. The author's action was to reveal each other's negative opinions, leading to a breakup. \n\nNow, the ethical angle. Was it right to intervene? The author might have thought they were helping by ending a bad relationship. However, the act of spying on their thoughts and then revealing them could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author didn't ask for permission to spread that information. It's like a betrayal of confidentiality. \n\nAlso, the author's own motives might be questionable. If their main goal was to eliminate competition, that adds a self-serving aspect. But they also mention that others on the team agreed it was a favor. So there's a conflicting perspectives here. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple was using the relationship to maintain a partnership in debate, not because they were truly compatible. The author might have thought they were doing a good deed by ending a forced relationship. But does that justify the means? \n\nIn terms of consequences, James was upset and blamed the author. Even if others saw it as a favor, the immediate emotional impact was negative. The author might not have considered the emotional toll on James and Mary. \n\nSo, considering all angles: intent (helpful vs. self-serving), breach of trust, and the consequences. The author's actions might not be the right way to handle the situation. Instead of intervening, maybe they should have advised the couple to communicate themselves. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated privacy and acted as a third party without the couple's consent, even if the outcome seemed positive.\n"
