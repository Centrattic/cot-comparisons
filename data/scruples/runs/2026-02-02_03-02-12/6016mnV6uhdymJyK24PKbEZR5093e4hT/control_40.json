My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by breaking up the couple, James and Mary. The author is part of a debate team and their main competition is this couple. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't really happy with each other but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting, and James was upset, blaming the author. Others, though, think the author did a favor because they were incompatible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Was the author justified in interfering? Well, the author's motivation was to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple. But is that a valid reason? It seems manipulative. The author might be using personal information to gain an advantage, which isn't fair. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's intent was strategic, not purely to help them. \n\nThen there's the issue of privacy. The author overheard or found out something personal and then used that information to disrupt the relationship. That's a breach of trust, even if others agreed with the outcome. Relationships are personal, and unless you're in a position to mediate, interfering can be wrong. \n\nAlso, the author might have exaggerated or misinterpreted what each person thought of the other. If the author took things out of context, that's another problem. Even if the info was accurate, sharing it without consent can cause harm.\n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a debate team where strategy is key. But using interpersonal manipulation instead of focusing on their own strengths (like being a better writer and in politics) might be a shortcut. It's possible that the author could have focused on improving their own campaign rather than undermining others.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the couple was only together for convenience, and the author did them a favor by ending a harmful situation. But the method of ending it is questionable. The right way would be to let them sort out their issues themselves or seek mediation, not to play the role of a matchmaker.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might seem beneficial, the method involved manipulation and breach of trust. The author's actions were ethically wrong because they used personal information to gain an advantage, even if it had positive side effects. So the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
