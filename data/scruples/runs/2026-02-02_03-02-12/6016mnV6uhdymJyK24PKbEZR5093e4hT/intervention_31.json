My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is on the debate team and considering AITA for breaking up a couple by telling them their true thoughts. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help the couple by revealing their incompatibility. They observed that James and Mary had mutual negative perceptions but stayed together because of their debate partnership. By telling them the truth, the author caused an argument and a breakup. The author argues that the couple was unhappy but stayed together for the wrong reasons, and others on the team agreed they were doing a favor.\n\nBut wait, is it right to meddle in someone else's relationship? Even if the author thought they were helping, did they have the right to share personal opinions that weren't directly asked for? Relationships are complex, and people might handle conflicts differently. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's action led to a public breakup and emotional distress (James crying). Could there have been a better way to approach this, like suggesting they talk to each other instead of acting as a messenger?\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be part of the issue. They want to win the captain position, so maybe there's an ulterior motive. Even if they didn't intend to sabotage, the context of competition could color their actions. Others might see it as helpful, but the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is a privacy breach. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respecting others' autonomy. The couple might not want their partner's opinions relayed by a third party. The author didn't ask for permission or give them a chance to address the issues themselves. While the outcome might have been positive (breaking up an unhappy relationship), the means could be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. If the author's action led to a better outcome, some might say they're not in the wrong. However, the method of intervention without consent and the potential for harm (public breakup, emotional distress) might mean the author is in the wrong. Different perspectives here: some might see it as meddling, others as a kind of honesty. But in AITA terms, often the person who meddles without being asked is in the wrong. So, maybe A (author is in the wrong) is the answer here.\n"
