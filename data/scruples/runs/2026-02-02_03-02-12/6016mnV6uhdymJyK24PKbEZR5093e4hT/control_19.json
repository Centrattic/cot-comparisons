My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that they're part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't really get along in their relationship\u2014they have mutual criticisms but stayed together because of the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author was doing them a favor by ending the unhappy relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's action. Telling someone what their partner thinks can be seen as interfering in a personal relationship. Even if the author had good intentions, like helping them realize the incompatibility, it's a sensitive issue. Relationships are personal, and bringing in third parties to end them can be problematic. The author might have crossed a line by revealing private thoughts, even if those thoughts were negative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to help James and Mary by making them aware of each other's real feelings, which they were hiding to maintain their partnership. If the relationship was indeed unhappy and the breakup was inevitable, maybe the author did a favor by accelerating a necessary separation. However, the method used\u2014spreading the negative perceptions without the consent of either party\u2014could be seen as harmful. It's possible that the breakup caused emotional distress, as James was crying, which indicates some level of harm.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the debate team. The author and Tim are competing against James and Mary for co-captains. The competition might have influenced the author's decision, as a breakup could weaken the competitors' chances. This could suggest a conflict of interest or ulterior motives, which might make the action more questionable. The author might be using personal information strategically to gain an advantage in the election, which is ethically dubious.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of privacy comes into play. James and Mary might not have wanted their private relationship issues to be shared. Even if the author had a good reason, the act of revealing such information without consent breaches trust. People might not appreciate their partner's thoughts being disclosed, regardless of the content.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the author is trying to help them be honest with themselves. If both parties were unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons, the author's intervention might have been necessary. However, the right approach would have been to talk to them individually and let them decide, rather than directly revealing each other's criticisms. The author's method was direct and public, leading to an argument in front of others, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but they didn't consider the consequences or seek permission. The breakup caused emotional pain, which is a negative outcome. While the author's intention was to help, the method and context (competition for co-captains) might taint the action's legitimacy.\n\nSo weighing all these factors: the invasion of privacy, the public nature of the breakup, the potential for causing emotional harm, and the possible conflict of interest due to competition, it seems like the author is in the wrong. Even if the outcome was positive (ending an unhappy relationship), the means used were inappropriate and lacked the necessary consideration and consent.\n"
