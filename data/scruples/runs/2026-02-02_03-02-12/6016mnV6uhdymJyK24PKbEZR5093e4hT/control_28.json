My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a debate team where the author's partner, Tim, is running for co-captain with them. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because they need to be a team for debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup in the middle of a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of this. The author didn't just overhear or passively know; they actively told each person what the other thought. That seems like a breach of trust or privacy. Even if the information was true, revealing someone else's private thoughts without permission can be harmful. People might have their reasons for staying in a relationship, even if it's not ideal. The author's motivation was to help them break up because they were incompatible, but that's a big decision for someone else to make. \n\nBut then again, the author argues that by breaking up, James and Mary might be happier. The other team members agreed it was a favor. However, causing a public breakup where James was crying seems like it could have been avoided. The method of revealing the thoughts was in a way that caused immediate conflict. Maybe the author could have approached it more discreetly or not at all. \n\nAlso, the author is in a competitive position against James and Mary. There's a potential conflict of interest here. The author might have wanted to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple, which could taint their intentions. Even if that's not the case, the action still led to significant emotional distress. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. On one hand, the author did a mean thing that led to public embarrassment and emotional pain. On the other, the outcome might have been for the better. But generally, meddling in others' relationships without their consent is considered wrong. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But some might argue B because the intention was good. However, the method was harmful and invasive. So leaning towards A.\n"
