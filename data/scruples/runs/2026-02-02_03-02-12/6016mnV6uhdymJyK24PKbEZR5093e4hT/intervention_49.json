My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The situation is that the author is part of a debate team and their partner is running for co-captain. They're competing against a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that they don't actually like each other much but are staying together because of their debate partnership. So the author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author didn't have a direct relationship with James and Mary. They overheard or found out through casual conversations that the couple wasn't compatible. The author's intention was probably to help by revealing the truth, thinking it would resolve their incompatibility. But by doing so, they caused immediate conflict and emotional distress, especially since James was crying.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were doing the right thing by helping the couple end a harmful relationship. The others on the team agreed with this view. But on the other hand, the author didn't have the right to meddle in someone else's personal relationship. They acted as a third party, spreading information that wasn't theirs to share, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. Even if the information was true, the way it was handled caused public humiliation and emotional harm.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't ask for permission from either party to share their opinions. Relationships are complex, and even if two people are unhappy, it's up to them to decide how to handle it. The author's interference, regardless of intent, crossed a line. They might have thought they were helping, but their actions led to a public breakup, which can have lasting negative effects on both individuals involved.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the debate team dynamics. The breakup might affect the team's performance, but the question here is about moral wrongdoing. The author's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, were intrusive and disrespectful of the couple's privacy. It's important to consider that even if the outcome (the breakup) was positive, the means by which it was achieved were harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might believe they were acting in the couple's best interest, their actions were inappropriate. They didn't have the right to interfere in James and Mary's relationship, and revealing private thoughts without consent is a violation of trust. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
