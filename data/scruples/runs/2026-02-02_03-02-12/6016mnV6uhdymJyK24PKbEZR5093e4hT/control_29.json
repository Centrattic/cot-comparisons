My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a high school debate team where the author is part of a co-captain running. The main conflict is that the author told each member of a competing couple what the other thought, which led to them breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author says they told Mary what James thought of her and vice versa. The couple was unhappy but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author's intention was to help them by revealing the truth, but it caused an argument and breakup. \n\nIs it right to intervene in someone else's relationship, even if they seem unhappy? Relationships are personal, and while the couple might have been incompatible, the author wasn't their friend. They might have overstepped by sharing private thoughts. However, the author argues that the couple was in a harmful situation and that breaking up would help them. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation: they wanted to eliminate competition by causing the breakup. Maybe there's an ulterior motive here, like wanting to win the co-captain position. If the author's main goal was to take down the competition rather than genuinely help the couple, that could be manipulation. \n\nThe response from others was that the author did a favor, but James was upset and blamed them. It's a mix of intentions and consequences. Even if the outcome was positive, the method might be questionable. Trust and honesty in relationships are important, but so is respecting privacy. The author didn't ask for permission to share these thoughts, which could be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might have been well-intentioned, but they crossed a line by revealing private opinions without consent. Even if the result was a breakup they didn't want, the means used could be considered wrong. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted because the outcome was positive. However, the method was manipulative and breached confidentiality.\n"
