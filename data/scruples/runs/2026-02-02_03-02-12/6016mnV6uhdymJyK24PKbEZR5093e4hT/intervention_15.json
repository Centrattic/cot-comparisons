My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The scenario is a high school debate team where the author, part of a partnership, is competing against another couple (James and Mary). The author found out that both James and Mary had negative opinions about each other but didn't want to break up because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author didn't have a direct relationship with James and Mary, just casual talks. By revealing their partners' true feelings, the author played a role in ending the relationship. But the reason they stayed together was because of their debate partnership, not genuine compatibility. \n\nWas the author justified? On one hand, the author might have thought they were helping them realize they were incompatible. On the other hand, the author wasn't in a position to meddle in their relationship. They might have crossed a line by using information from casual conversations to intentionally cause a breakup. Plus, James was upset and blamed the author, which shows the emotional impact. \n\nBut others agreed it was a favor, so maybe the outcome was positive. However, the method of intervention is questionable. Telling someone how their partner feels without their consent could be seen as a violation of trust. The author might have acted out of self-interest to eliminate competition as well. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. While the intentions might have been good, the method and the lack of consent make it ethically questionable. People generally have the right to privacy in their relationships, even if the relationship isn't healthy. The author might be in the wrong because they took it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they meddled without justification, even if the outcome seemed better. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) since they helped end an unhappy situation. However, the act of revealing private information without consent tends to lean towards A.\n"
