My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation involves them breaking up a couple by telling each what the other thought. The author is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't really get along but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them the negative things the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by ending their unhappy relationship, which others agreed was a favor. But did the author have the right to intervene? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author might have overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked.\n\nOn one hand, the author's action led to a breakup that made both parties unhappy. James was crying and blamed the author, which shows emotional harm. However, the couple's friends thought the author did the right thing because the relationship was harmful due to incompatibility and the partnership. \n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. They wanted to eliminate competition for the captain positions. Maybe the breakup was strategic, which complicates the moral justification. Even if the couple was unhappy, the timing and context (mid-meeting) might be inconsiderate. \n\nBut the couple was already in a fragile situation, relying on their partnership for debate, not just the relationship. The author might have thought that breaking them up would improve the debate team's dynamics. However, relationships are complex, and external interference can have unintended consequences. \n\nThe key points are: the author's role in causing the breakup, the justification for doing so, and the consequences. While the outcome was a breakup that others supported, the act of revealing personal thoughts without consent could be seen as a violation of trust. However, the couple wasn't truthful with each other, so the author's action might have been a necessary intervention. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because their intention was to help and the relationship was already toxic. But there's a line between helping and meddling. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the outcome was positive, even if the method was harsh. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because they meddled without consent. \n\nConsidering the debate team context and the strategic angle, the author's actions might be seen as a calculated move rather than purely altruistic. That could tip the balance to A. But the story says others agreed it was a favor. Hmm. I think B is more likely the answer here.\n"
