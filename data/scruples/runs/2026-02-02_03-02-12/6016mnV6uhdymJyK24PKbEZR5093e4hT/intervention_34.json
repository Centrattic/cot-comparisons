My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by revealing to James and Mary what they thought of each other, leading to their breakup. The author's perspective is that they're not in the wrong because it was a favor, even though it caused immediate pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is part of a debate team and sees the competition as the couple, James and Mary. They overheard that both aren't happy in the relationship but stay together for debate. The author decides to tell each of them the other's negative thoughts, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset, blaming the author, but others agree it was a favor since they were incompatible.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intent, consequences, and the moral duty of the author. The author's intent was to help them realize their incompatibility. However, the method involved deception or at least sharing private thoughts without consent. Did the author have the right to intervene? \n\nIn relationships, third parties often meddle, but the line between helping and interfering can be thin. The author might have thought they were doing a good deed, but was it their place to act as a matchmaker? Also, the author's motivation could be to weaken the competition, which introduces a potential conflict of interest. Maybe the author's actions were not entirely selfless.\n\nConsequences-wise, the couple broke up, which resolved their mutual unhappiness. But breaking up in a public setting during a meeting might have been harsh. The emotional impact on James, who was crying, is significant. But others on the team seem to support the action, seeing it as a favor.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but ethically, the question is about crossing boundaries. The author didn't have permission to share personal opinions. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role as a third party is questionable. The debate team context adds that the author is in a competitive environment, which might influence their judgment. Could there be ulterior motives here besides helping the couple?\n\nIn relationships, sometimes people stay together for external reasons (like work partnerships), and third-party intervention can be tricky. The author might have acted without understanding the full context. For example, maybe the couple had reasons to stay together despite their issues, or they might have worked through their differences if given time. The author's action was abrupt and public, which isn't the best way to handle sensitive situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple might not have addressed their issues otherwise, and the breakup was inevitable. By revealing their true feelings, the author might have accelerated a necessary separation. However, that doesn't necessarily make it right. The method of disclosure is important. A private conversation might be more appropriate than a public confrontation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was well-intentioned but possibly misguided. They overstepped by sharing private thoughts without consent, which led to emotional distress. Even if the outcome was positive, the means were questionable. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they meddled without permission and caused harm, even if the result was favorable.\n"
