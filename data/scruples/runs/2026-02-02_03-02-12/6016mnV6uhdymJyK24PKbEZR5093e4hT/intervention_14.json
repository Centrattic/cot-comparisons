My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by breaking up a couple, Tim and the author's partner, by telling them what they really thought of each other. The author is part of a debate team and they're running for co-captains against a competing couple, James and Mary. The author learned that James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author was doing them a favor.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. First, the author's intention: they wanted to help James and Mary by being honest about their mutual negative perceptions. The author's reasoning is that the couple was incompatible and staying together for debate was making them unhappy. The outcome was a breakup, which relieved the pressure of being forced to stay together, even though James was upset.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have acted out of concern for the couple's well-being. If the relationship was causing them unhappiness and the author's intervention led to a healthier separation, then it could be seen as a good deed. However, on the other hand, the author might have overstepped by revealing private thoughts without consent. Relationships are personal, and even if the author believed the information was accurate, spreading it without the couple's permission could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, there's the motive to consider. The author is competing against the couple for leadership positions. Could there be an element of self-interest here? The author might have wanted to eliminate a strong competitor by breaking up the couple, even if the intention was genuine. Even if the author didn't act with malice, the timing and context might suggest a conflict of interest.\n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a debate team where teamwork and alliances matter. By causing a breakup, the author could have disrupted the team's dynamic. However, the response from others was that they agreed the author did the right thing by helping the couple part ways. So maybe the community supports the action.\n\nBut then again, the ethical aspect is that people have the right to privacy and to decide their own relationships. The author assumed the role of a mediator without being asked and shared information that could be hurtful. Even if the outcome seemed positive, the method might be questionable. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests that the approach was harsh and maybe not the best way to handle the situation. Perhaps a more discreet approach, like talking to each person individually and letting them decide, would have been better.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome might have been beneficial in terms of ending an unhappy relationship, the author's actions involved revealing others' private thoughts without consent, which could be considered a violation of trust. The motive, even if altruistic, might have been influenced by competition, which complicates the ethics. Therefore, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they interfered in someone else's relationship without permission, regardless of the outcome.\n"
