My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, part of a debate team, breaks up a couple (James and Mary) by telling them what each other thinks negatively. The author's motive is that they're competing against this couple for co-captain positions and believes the couple's relationship is causing them to stay together despite being incompatible, which might affect the debate team's dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author isn't friends with either James or Mary but overheard or found out their mutual negative thoughts. By revealing these thoughts, the author caused a breakup during a debate meeting, which led to James crying and blaming the author. However, others on the team agreed that they were doing the couple a favor.\n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. Did the author have the right to meddle in their relationship? The author's intention was to help, thinking the couple was unhappy and staying together for the sake of debate. But relationships are personal, and breaking them up, even with good intentions, can be seen as crossing a line. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on James and Mary. Even if the couple was incompatible, the author's role as a competitor might have been a factor in their decision, possibly introducing bias.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action led to the couple being honest with each other, ending a potentially harmful situation. The team's support suggests that others saw the author's action as a positive intervention. However, relationships are complex, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role in actively causing the breakup could be seen as manipulative, especially since they're in a competitive position. There's also the question of whether the author accurately conveyed the partners' thoughts without misinterpretation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If someone is intentionally keeping a relationship together for strategic reasons (like a debate partnership) despite personal dissatisfaction, maybe an external person has a duty to intervene. But the author's position as a competitor might mean their motives aren't entirely neutral, which complicates things. The emotional harm caused to James, even if the outcome is seen as better, might make the author partially responsible. \n\nSo, considering the ethical implications, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they meddled in someone else's personal life without consent, even if the result was positive. Alternatively, if the couple was already in a harmful situation, the author might not be in the wrong (B) for helping them realize the truth. Given the context, I'm leaning towards A because the author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked, which can be seen as an overreach, regardless of the outcome.\n"
