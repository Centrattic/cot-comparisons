My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's part of a debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because they're debate partners. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's actions. Did they have the right to interfere in James and Mary's relationship? The author's motivation was to help them by revealing their incompatibility, which others agreed with. But maybe the author overstepped by not considering the potential fallout. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple wasn't happy, it's their choice to end it. The author's role in causing a public breakup might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author is using this information to gain a strategic advantage in the election. If James and Mary break up, they can't run together, which might help the author and Tim. That could be a conflict of interest. The author's actions might be self-serving, even if they believe they're helping.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they were doing a favor because the couple was unhappy. But relationships are complex, and even if there are issues, the decision to break up is up to the couple. The author's interference might have caused unnecessary pain, like James crying, which suggests emotional harm. \n\nSo, there's a balance between helping someone make a hard decision and respecting their autonomy. The author's information might have been truthful, but revealing it without consent crosses a boundary. The fact that the breakup happened publicly in a meeting adds to the drama and potential embarrassment for both parties. \n\nTherefore, while the author's intention might have been good, the method was intrusive and possibly self-motivated. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship for their own benefit, even if others agreed they were helping.\n"
