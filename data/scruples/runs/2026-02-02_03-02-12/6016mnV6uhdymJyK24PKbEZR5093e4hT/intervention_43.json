My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for causing a breakup between James and Mary by telling them what they thought of each other. The author is on the debate team and their partner, Tim, is running for co-captains. Their competition is the couple James and Mary from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together for their debate partnership. The author then told each of them the other's true opinions, leading to a breakup.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author did the right thing. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants another opinion. The possible answers are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Spreading someone's private thoughts without permission can be considered a breach of trust. But the author's intention was to help them realize the relationship isn't healthy. The result was the breakup, which some might see as a positive because they were incompatible. However, causing emotional distress, like James crying, is a negative consequence. \n\nOn the one hand, the author might argue it's for the greater good, preventing a harmful, forced relationship. On the other hand, the author didn't ask for permission to share their thoughts, which could be seen as crossing a boundary. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is inauthentic, it's not for others to interfere. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. That could introduce self-interest into the situation, which complicates things. If the author's main goal was to help the couple, it's one thing, but if it's to undermine their competition, that's manipulative. \n\nThe outcome had mixed results: some people agreed with the author, but it caused emotional pain. Ethically, is it justifiable to cause short-term pain for a long-term benefit? It's tricky. In some contexts, like a close friend helping a couple, it might be seen as well-meaning. But here, the author isn't a close friend. \n\nAlso, the author's role as a debater might value honesty and truth, but applying that to personal relationships isn't straightforward. Relationships require trust and communication, and the author's action bypassed that process. \n\nSo, the key factors are consent, intent, and consequences. Without consent, sharing private thoughts is problematic, even if the intent was good. The consequences were both positive (breaking up a harmful relationship) and negative (emotional harm). However, the intent might have been mixed (helping the couple vs. helping their own team's chances). \n\nIn conclusion, the author likely overstepped by revealing private opinions without considering the couple's autonomy to address their issues themselves. While the outcome might have been positive, the method was intrusive. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
