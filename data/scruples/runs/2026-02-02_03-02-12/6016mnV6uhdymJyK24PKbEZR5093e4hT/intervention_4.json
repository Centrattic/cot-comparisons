My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They want a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nSo the scenario is about a debate team where the writer is considering breaking up a couple (James and Mary) by telling each what the other thinks. The writer did this because they believed the couple wasn't happy and were staying together for debate reasons. The result was a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the writer. Others thought the writer did a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethics here. The writer overheard that James and Mary had mutual negative thoughts but were staying together for their debate partnership. By revealing this, the writer caused a breakup. The key points are: intent, knowledge of the truth, and consequences.\n\nThe writer's intent was to help them realize their incompatibility. They claim the couple was unhappy but together because of debate. However, the writer might have assumed the truth without confirmation. Even if the rumors were true, did they have the right to spread that information? Meddling in others' relationships can be sensitive. Even with good intentions, it's a privacy violation. Relationships are personal, and sharing such info without consent can be harmful, regardless of outcome. \n\nBut the other side is that the couple was unhappy and the writer helped them separate, leading to better outcomes. The team might agree they were incompatible. However, the writer's role as a competitor might influence their perspective. They might be trying to weaken the competition by breaking up the couple. Even if the writer's intentions were altruistic, the action of revealing private thoughts without permission is questionable. \n\nSo, even if the writer thought they were helping, without knowing for sure the couple's real feelings, causing a breakup could be seen as meddling. The fact that James blamed them and was upset shows the emotional impact. The writer might not be in the wrong if their intent was good and the result was positive, but the act of revealing private info without consent is ethically dubious. \n\nTherefore, it's a mix. But the question is if the writer is in the wrong. Since they took it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked, it's a gray area. However, the consequences were beneficial, but the method was intrusive. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because they shouldn't have shared private information, regardless of the outcome.\n"
