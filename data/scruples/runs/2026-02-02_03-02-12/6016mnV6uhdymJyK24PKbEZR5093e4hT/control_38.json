My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. They're worried about the competition from James and Mary, who are a couple but from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them the negative things the other thinks about them, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think the author did them a favor.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and consequences. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their true feelings towards each other, which they think is incompatible. But did they overstep? Spreading someone else's private thoughts without permission can be a breach of trust. Even if the intent was good, the method might be questionable. \n\nAlso, the author isn't friends with either James or Mary, so where did they get this information? If they heard these opinions from others or overheard conversations, sharing them could be gossiping. Even if it's true, sharing private information without consent can harm relationships, even if the outcome is positive. \n\nOn the other hand, the result was a breakup that both parties were unhappy with. The author's action led to them being honest with each other, which might have been necessary. But was it the author's place to intervene? Relationships are personal, and while the author is part of the debate team, mixing personal and professional isn't always appropriate. \n\nThe debate for co-captains means that the author's actions could affect team dynamics. Maybe the breakup will influence the election, which is a valid concern. However, manipulating relationships to win an election could be seen as underhanded. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They might have good intentions, but the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is problematic. Even if it led to a positive outcome, the method was intrusive. The author took it upon themselves to play a role in their relationships, which isn't their place. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
