My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing what each thought of the other. They're on the debate team and their partner is running for co-captains against another couple, James and Mary.\n\nFirst, the author knew that James and Mary were in a relationship but not happy because of their differences. Mary thought James was a \"big mouth, small brain,\" and James saw Mary as too idealistic and boring. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to an argument and breakup.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent and consequences. The author's intent was to help them be honest and maybe avoid a forced relationship. But the consequence was the breakup, which hurt James, who cried and blamed the author. Others on the team thought the author was doing a favor because the couple was incompatible.\n\nBut is it the author's place to meddle in their relationship? Even if the couple was unhappy, the author might have overstepped by revealing personal thoughts. Relationships are private, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author's action could be seen as a betrayal. However, the author's reasoning is that they were keeping the relationship together for debate, not their actual feelings. The team's support suggests others see it as a positive outcome.\n\nBut is it ethical to act as a go-between? Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent can be harmful. The author might not be in the wrong if the intention was good, but the action still caused direct harm. It's a gray area. Some might say it's meddling, others that it's helping them be honest. The answer depends on whether the ends justify the means here. Since the author's action led to a breakup, even if it was for a good reason, they might still be in the wrong because they took a direct role in ending the relationship without the couple's consent.\n"
