My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is part of a debate team and is running for co-captain with their partner Tim. Their main competitors are James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary didn't really get along but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a team meeting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, first, the author's intention was to help by revealing the truth. They thought the couple was incompatible and that breaking up would make them happier. But was it their place to do that? Relationships are personal, and even if the author had good intentions, intentionally causing a breakup by sharing private thoughts could be seen as meddling. However, the couple's friends agreed that the author was doing them a favor, which suggests that the outcome was positive. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of privacy. Did the author have the right to disclose what they overheard? If the author knew the couple's private opinions through casual conversations, sharing that information without consent could be a breach of trust. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method of revealing it in public during a meeting might have been harsh and led to embarrassment, especially with James crying. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might have prevented a longer, unhappy relationship. The couple's dynamic was affecting their partnership, and the author's interference led to a resolution that others supported. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but ethically, it's tricky. The author didn't have the couple's permission to share their private thoughts. Even if the outcome was positive, the means were questionable. However, the author might argue they were helping by ending a harmful situation. \n\nSo, considering the debate team's perspective where the author's goal was to outmaneuver competitors, there's a potential ulterior motive. The author might have wanted to weaken the competitors by breaking up their partnership, even if it wasn't the primary reason. That could add another layer of intent that's less about helping and more about strategic advantage. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been beneficial, the method involved without consent and caused public embarrassment. That makes the author's actions ethically questionable, leaning towards being in the wrong. But others might see it as a well-meaning intervention. So the answer could be either, but based on the information, the author's actions were intrusive and unkind, so they might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
