My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who's on the debate team, breaking up a couple (James and Mary) by revealing to each what the other thought about them. The context is that they're competing against each other for co-captain positions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by letting them know the truth about each other's thoughts, which they weren't happy with but stayed together for the sake of debate. The breakup happened in front of others, causing emotional distress to James. However, others on the team supported the author's action, seeing it as a favor because the couple was incompatible and unhappy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, meddling in others' relationships is generally frowned upon. Even if the intention was good, sharing private thoughts without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but relationships are complex, and forcing a breakup based on third-party opinions could be harmful. However, if the couple was already unhappy and the author's intervention allowed them to address their issues, maybe it's justified. But the emotional impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, suggests that there's a valid grievance here.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially and morally, it's a gray area. The author might not be wrong in the sense that they were trying to help, but they crossed a boundary by revealing private information. The couple's privacy was invaded, leading to public humiliation and a breakup that might have been avoided if they addressed their issues without outside interference.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer could go either way. But usually, in such scenarios, the person who interfered is seen as at fault because they didn't have the right to share others' private thoughts, even if their intention was good. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
