My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by telling each of them what the other really thought. The author is on a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is this couple, and the author thought that by causing them to break up, it would help their own chances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author didn't have permission to meddle in the relationship. They used their position and knowledge to interfere, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's intention was partly self-serving, to make their own team look better. That's a conflict of interest. \n\nThen there's the issue of honesty versus betrayal. While it's true that the couple wasn't happy, the author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked. Relationships are supposed to be between the two people involved, and third parties shouldn't step in unless there's a serious issue affecting others. In this case, the author's main motivation was their own benefit, not purely to help James and Mary. \n\nAlso, the consequences were significant\u2014James was crying, and there was a public argument. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the method was harsh. The author's actions might have crossed a line, using the couple's professional partnership as leverage or justification. \n\nOn the other hand, the user mentions that others on the debate team agreed the author was doing a favor. But that doesn't necessarily make it right. Group validation doesn't always equate to ethical correctness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were ethically questionable. They meddled in a personal matter for their own gain, leading to emotional harm. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
