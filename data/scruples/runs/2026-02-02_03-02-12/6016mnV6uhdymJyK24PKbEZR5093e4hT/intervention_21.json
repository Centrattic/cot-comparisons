My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was crying and blamed the author, but others thought the author was doing them a favor because the couple was incompatible.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nLet me break down the key points. The author's intention was to help by ending a harmful situation where the couple was staying together because of mutual benefit (debate partnership) even though they were unhappy. The author had information that the couple had negative opinions of each other. By revealing that info, the author caused a breakup, which the couple's peers supported as a favor.\n\nBut, there's an issue with privacy and trust here. The author didn't ask for permission to share their thoughts. Even if the couple was unhappy, it's not the author's place to act as a mediator without consent. The author might have crossed a boundary by sharing personal thoughts without knowing the full context. Even if the couple was incompatible, the decision to break up should be theirs, not forced by someone else's intervention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action led to a positive outcome: the couple was unhappy and the breakup might have been inevitable. The author might have prevented a continuing fake relationship that was harmful. But the method used (spreading the thoughts) is problematic. It's possible the author didn't consider how the information would be received or if it was accurate. Maybe the author misunderstood the couple's dynamic or took their comments out of context.\n\nAnother angle: relationships are private. Even if the couple's partnership was affecting the debate team, it's not the author's responsibility to interfere unless it's directly impacting them. The author's motivation was competitive (to get co-captain positions), so there might be ulterior motives. However, the author claims it was for the couple's well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. While the outcome might have been good, the means were invasive. Spreading others' private thoughts without consent is generally a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the action is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they overstepped and interfered in a personal matter without consent, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). The action of revealing private thoughts without permission is a violation, regardless of the intent.\n"
