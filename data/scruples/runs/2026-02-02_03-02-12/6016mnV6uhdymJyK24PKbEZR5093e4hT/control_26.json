My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's on the debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple but come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary actually don't like each other very much but are staying together because they're a debate team. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author's reason for doing this was strategic, maybe to eliminate competition by breaking up their partnership. But did they have the right to do that? Well, relationships are personal, and even though the couple was staying together for strategic reasons, the author's interference led to a public breakup and emotional distress. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were helping James and Mary realize they were incompatible and that the relationship was making them unhappy. The other debaters agreed with the author, so maybe they saw it as a positive outcome. But on the other hand, the author didn't have consent to spread that information. They acted as a mediator without being asked, which could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nIs it right to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if the intention is good? The author's motivation was partly self-serving (to win the election) and partly thinking they were helping. But the method involved revealing private thoughts that could damage the relationship. Even if the outcome was a breakup, the means of getting there might be unethical. \n\nJames blamed the author, which suggests that he felt betrayed. The emotional impact on James, who was crying, is significant. While Mary might have felt the same, the story is from James's perspective. The author's action could be seen as manipulation, using information to cause a split for personal gain. \n\nSo, even if the result was a healthier situation for James and Mary in the long run, the act of intentionally sabotaging their relationship by spreading each other's criticisms without their consent seems like a breach of ethics. The author's justification is that they were doing a favor, but relationships are complex, and the author might not have considered the emotional consequences. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's actions directly led to the breakup. Even if they had good intentions, intentionally causing a breakup by revealing private information is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
