My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by breaking up a couple (James and Mary) to help their own chances of becoming debate co-captains. The author is part of a debate team and is competing against this couple. The key points here are the context of the situation, the author's intentions, and the outcome.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that James and Mary are from different social groups and were in a relationship that wasn't healthy. They each had negative opinions about each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author decided to tell each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author did the right thing.\n\nNow, considering the ethics: was the author justified in interfering? The author's motive was to improve their own team's chances, which introduces a conflict of interest. However, the author's argument is that the couple was unhappy and only staying together for the partnership, not the relationship. The breakup might have been beneficial for both parties in the long run, as they were incompatible.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is using information to manipulate the situation for personal gain. Even if the couple wasn't happy, the author took a direct action that caused emotional distress (James was crying). The question is whether the author overstepped by acting as a mediator or instigator without being asked. In relationships, honesty is important, but the method of delivery can matter a lot. The author might have crossed a line by not giving the couple a chance to address their issues themselves or by not being a neutral party.\n\nAlso, the author is part of a competitive environment, so the action might be seen as a strategic move rather than an altruistic one. Even if the outcome was positive for James and Mary, the intent of the author could influence the judgment. If the main goal was self-interest (getting co-captain), then it's more questionable. The author might be in the wrong because they used personal information to disrupt a partnership for their own benefit, regardless of the outcome.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author did a favor by ending a harmful situation. The line here is thin. The author's knowledge about the couple's unhappiness is from casual conversations, so they might not have all the context. The act of revealing such personal thoughts could be seen as meddling, even if the result was positive.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome might have been beneficial, the method and intent could place the author in the wrong. The decision to interfere in a personal relationship for strategic reasons, even if well-intentioned, might not be ethically sound. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they used their position to manipulate the situation for personal gain, causing immediate emotional harm despite potential long-term benefits.\n"
