My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up James and Mary by telling each what the other thought. \n\nFirst, the situation: they're on a debate team and want to become co-captains. Their competition is a couple from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy but stay together for debate. The author tells each of them the bad things the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author did this out of a desire to help, thinking the couple was incompatible. They believed the partnership was keeping them in an unhappy relationship because of their debate goals. The result was an argument and breakup, with James blaming the author, but others agreeing it was a favor.\n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. Is it right to act as a mediator here? Well, the author wasn't a therapist or a mutual friend. They might not be in a position to mediate their relationship. But the author's intention was to help them realize they're unhappy. However, relationships are personal, and inserting yourself as a third party to break them up, even with good intentions, can be problematic. \n\nThe author might have crossed a line by revealing private thoughts without consent. Even if they thought it was for the best, it's not their place to play matchmaker or break up others. The couple might not have wanted to know each other's negative opinions. The fact that it led to a public breakup and emotional distress (James crying) suggests that the method was harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's action did stop an incompatibility that was affecting their debate team dynamics. If the couple's unhappiness was impacting their performance, maybe the team benefits from them being single. But that's a stretch. The author's personal gain in competition might be a factor too. Did they act out of self-interest? Maybe, which could taint the altruistic motive. \n\nIn terms of morality, intent matters, but actions also matter. The author's intent was to help, but the action of revealing private thoughts without consent led to negative consequences. So, the line between helping and interfering is thin here. \n\nIn many cultures, relationships are private, and outsiders shouldn't meddle. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role in breaking them up without their consent could be seen as wrong. However, others might argue that the author helped them face the truth. \n\nBut in this case, the author's role in the team and their own competition might have influenced their decision. It's possible that the author wanted to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple, even if they convinced themselves it was for their own good. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a private relationship without consent, leading to emotional harm. But some might argue the positive outcome justifies it. However, the method and the breach of trust are significant issues. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
