My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told two people in a relationship what the other person thought about them, which led to them breaking up. The author's reason for doing this was to prevent them from continuing an unhappy relationship just because they needed to stay a debate team partnership.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author claims that both James and Mary were unhappy with each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author thought that by revealing their true feelings, they were doing a favor. But was it right for them to interfere?\n\nOn one hand, people have a right to privacy in their relationships. The author didn't ask for permission to share what they overheard or knew about each person's thoughts. Even if the intention was good, did they have the right to act as a mediator or expose private feelings without consent?\n\nThen there's the impact. The breakup happened in public during a debate meeting, causing emotional distress, with James crying. The author's action directly led to this breakup. Even if others on the team agreed it was a good idea, the immediate consequences were negative. The author might have thought they were helping, but the method was intrusive.\n\nAlso, the author is part of the competition. Their motive could be to eliminate a rival by breaking up the couple-partner team. Even if the author's argument is that the couple was incompatible, the timing and context might suggest self-interest. That could affect the credibility of their actions being purely altruistic.\n\nBut the other side is that relationships should be based on mutual respect and honesty. If both parties were unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons, maybe the author did help them realize the truth. However, the method of intervention is still questionable. Shouldn't the couple have addressed the issues themselves, with maybe a third party mediating privately?\n\nSo considering both angles, the author's actions were well-intentioned but crossed a line by not getting consent and by acting in a way that publicly exposed private feelings. The intent might have been to help, but the execution was problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled without permission, even if the outcome was seen as beneficial by others.\n"
