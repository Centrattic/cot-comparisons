My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is part of a debate team and their partner Tim is running for co-captains. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because they needed to be a team for debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to an argument and breakup. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider ethics here. The author's actions were based on strategy for the debate team, but they intentionally caused a breakup. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author had no right to meddle. The author might argue that they were helping by ending a harmful situation, but it's not their place to intervene. Also, the author used their position to manipulate the team dynamics for their own benefit, which is underhanded. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple might have been unhappy, but the author's method was direct and harmful. Spreading that kind of information without consent is a violation of trust. Even if the outcome was a breakup, the means were questionable. The fact that James was crying shows the emotional impact. \n\nIn relationships, people should handle their own issues. The author's intention was to help their own team's chances, but using such tactics is manipulative and crosses ethical boundaries. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
