My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is that the person is part of a debate team and their partner is planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author overstepped. The key points here are the motivations and the consequences. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by ending their harmful relationship, even though it was driven by their desire to win the co-captain election. But was the method appropriate? Spreading someone else's private thoughts without their consent can be a breach of trust, even if the intention is good.\n\nOn one hand, James and Mary were keeping the relationship because of debate, not because they were happy. The author's action might have prevented them from staying in an unhappy relationship. Others on the team agreed that the author was doing a favor. But on the other hand, the author didn't have the right to meddle in their personal lives. Relationships are complex, and even if they were unhappy, it's not anyone else's place to intervene unless it's causing direct harm to others.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on James, who was crying, suggests that the breakup affected him deeply. The author might have caused unnecessary pain, even if the relationship wasn't healthy. The argument could be made that the author acted out of self-interest (to beat the competition) rather than genuine concern for James and Mary. Even if the outcome was positive, the means used were invasive and could be seen as manipulative.\n\nSo, weighing the intention versus the method: the intention was to end an unhappy relationship, but the method involved betraying confidences and causing public embarrassment. The author might have crossed a line by using private information to their advantage in a competitive situation, which could be seen as using underhanded tactics. Therefore, while the outcome might have been beneficial, the action itself could be considered wrong because it involved interfering in others' relationships for strategic reasons.\n"
