My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did something wrong by telling each person what the other thought of them. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is on a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple. The author knows that both James and Mary are unhappy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, which leads to them breaking up during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's intent. The author might have thought that breaking up the couple would weaken their competition and increase their own chances of becoming co-captains. But the author argues that the couple was incompatible and that their break-up allowed them to be happier. However, the author didn't ask for permission to meddle in their relationship. Spreading someone else's private thoughts without consent is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if the outcome was positive, the method used was interfering in their personal lives. The author's actions led to public embarrassment and emotional distress for James, which could be seen as harmful. On the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and staying together only for the partnership, maybe the author's intervention was well-intentioned. But the line between helping and interfering is thin here. The author's motivation might also be questionable if it's to undermine the competition rather than genuinely help the couple. So, even if the result was beneficial, the action itself is problematic because it involves deceit and manipulation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
