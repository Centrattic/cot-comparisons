My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each what the other thinks. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author noticed that neither James nor Mary were happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted out of a belief that the couple was incompatible and that their relationship was causing unhappiness, possibly because they were staying together for strategic reasons related to their debate goals. The outcome was a breakup, with James crying and blaming the author, but others thought the author was right to do it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. I need to consider intentions, actions, and consequences.\n\nThe author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing the truth about each other's negative perceptions. However, relationships are personal, and inserting oneself into someone else's relationship without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. Even if the author's motive was good, the act of spreading information that could cause harm might be considered meddling. \n\nBut another angle is that the author might have felt that the couple's unhappiness and incompatibility were affecting their debate performance or that the author and Tim were being unfairly disadvantaged because James and Mary were a strong competition due to their combined social influence. The author may have believed that breaking them up would benefit the team dynamics or their own chances of winning the co-captain position.\n\nHowever, the ethical issue here is whether it's right to interfere in a relationship, even if it's for what seems like a good cause. Relationships have their own complexities, and one person's perception of incompatibility doesn't necessarily justify another person acting on it. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust and a form of manipulation, especially if they used their position or influence within the debate team to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the author's intervention led to a breakup that resolved their unhappiness, some might argue it was a compassionate act. But the method of doing so\u2014telling each person what the other thinks without their consent\u2014could be problematic regardless of the outcome.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is part of a debate team where strategic alliances and partnerships are important adds another layer. The author might have felt competitive pressure, but that doesn't excuse interference in personal relationships.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a judgment call. However, generally, interfering in someone else's relationship, even with good intentions, is often considered meddling and can be seen as wrong. The author's actions might have short-term benefits for the team or their own goals but could have long-term negative effects on trust and team dynamics.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, involved meddling in a personal relationship without consent. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
