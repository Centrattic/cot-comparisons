My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a debate team member who broke up a couple by telling each what the other thought. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another team, which is a couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that the couple isn't really happy but stays together because of their debate partnership. The author decided to tell each of them the other's negative thoughts, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James cried and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted to disrupt a competitive couple's partnership by revealing their mutual disdain. The intention was to help them break up since they were incompatible but stayed together for debate reasons. The result was a public breakup, which caused emotional distress to James.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, there are a few angles. Intention matters. The author's intent was to help them by ending an unhappy relationship. However, the means involved revealing private thoughts without consent, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if the end result seemed positive (they were incompatible), the method of using the information shared in confidence might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author might have overstepped by acting as a \"matchmaker\" or \"problem solver\" without being asked. Relationships are personal, and while the couple's dynamic affected the debate team, it's debatable whether the author had the right to intervene. Even if others agreed it was a favor, causing emotional harm (James was crying) is a significant consequence. The author's actions led to a public breakup, which could be traumatic, regardless of the relationship's quality.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was unhappy and the author's action helped them realize their incompatibility, maybe it's seen as a good outcome. But the method of delivery was confrontational and public. Maybe a more discreet approach would have been better. The line between helping and interfering is thin here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author used information they had from casual conversations, which might not have been confidential. But even so, sharing such personal criticisms could be seen as spreading rumors or gossip. The debate team context might add pressure, but the author's decision to act on their own to sabotage the competition, even indirectly, could be considered underhanded.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were well-intentioned but crossed ethical boundaries. They shouldn't have shared private thoughts without consent, leading to emotional harm. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
