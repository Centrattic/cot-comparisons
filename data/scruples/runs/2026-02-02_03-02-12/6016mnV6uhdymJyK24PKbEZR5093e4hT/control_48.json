My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. Hmm. So the situation is that they're in debate, and they're planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to intervene. The author isn't friends with either James or Mary, just casual conversation. They overheard or found out that the two had negative opinions of each other. Then the author decided to act on that information, leading to a breakup. \n\nI think the key points here are: the author's intent, the method used, and the consequences. The author's intention was to help by ending an unhappy relationship, but did they have the right to do that? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple wasn't happy, it's their choice to end it. The author meddled without being asked, which is a form of betrayal of trust. Even if the outcome might have been better for both parties, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is problematic. \n\nAlso, considering the consequences: James was crying and blamed the author. The breakup happened in public, which could be embarrassing for all involved. Even though others agreed it was a favor, that doesn't make it right. The author took matters into their own hands without considering the emotional impact. \n\nSo, even if the result was positive (they were incompatible), the method was inappropriate. The author didn't have the right to play mediator or informer. Relationships are between two people, and third parties shouldn't interfere unless there's some form of consent or authority. The author's actions were a breach of privacy and could be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
