My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. They're up against another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intention was to stop the couple from being unhappy and to help their own team by eliminating competition. The problem is that they acted as a go-between for negative opinions, leading to a breakup. \n\nThe ethical angle here is about privacy and consent. Did the author have the right to share James and Mary's private thoughts without their permission? Even if the author thought it was for their own good, sharing such information can be seen as a violation of trust. Relationships are complex, and while James and Mary might have been unhappy, it's their decision to work through the issues or separate. The author's action directly caused the breakup, which could be seen as meddling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were helping James and Mary realize they're not compatible. But the method was to spread negative info without their knowledge. It's possible that James and Mary might have worked out their differences on their own, or at least have a different outcome if the truth wasn't forced upon them so harshly.\n\nAlso, the author's motive was partly self-serving, to reduce competition. That might color their judgment. Even if the result was positive (the couple breaking up), the means might be questionable. Intentions matter, but so does the action itself. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually respect others' privacy and relationships unless there's significant harm. The author's action led to public embarrassment and emotional distress (James crying). Even if others agreed it was a favor, the way it was handled might not be the right approach.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for meddling in someone else's relationship without their consent, regardless of the outcome.\n"
