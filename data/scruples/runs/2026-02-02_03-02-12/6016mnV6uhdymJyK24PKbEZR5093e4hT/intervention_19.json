My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did the right thing by breaking up James and Mary. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of revealing private thoughts. Usually, people keep such things to themselves unless it's a breach of confidentiality. The author might have overheard or guessed their feelings, but sharing that without permission could be seen as crossing a line. However, if the author was a friend, maybe the situation is different. Here, the author isn't friends with either, just casually talks. So maybe they shouldn't have shared that info.\n\nThen, the motive: the author wanted to remove competition. That seems self-serving. Even if the couple was unhappy, using that to their advantage might not be ethical. But the author's reasoning is that they were doing a favor by ending an unhappy relationship. The outcome was both sides agreeing they were incompatible, so maybe the author helped them in the long run.\n\nBut is it right to interfere in someone else's relationship? People can handle their own issues. The author might have thought they were helping, but relationships are complex. Even if the couple had issues, the author isn't in a position to judge or act. The breakup led to immediate conflict, with James crying, which shows emotional impact.\n\nOthers on the team supported the action, thinking it was a favor. But that doesn't mean it's right. Group consensus doesn't validate the act if it's a breach of trust. Also, James blamed the author, so there's a personal fallout.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions versus the consequences. The author might have good intentions but interfered inappropriately. The information shared could have been private, and the method of sharing it during a meeting seems harsh. Even if the result was a breakup, the means might be unethical.\n\nBut maybe the author believed they were helping, and the team's support reinforces that. However, the act of revealing such personal thoughts without consent is generally considered a mistake. People should handle their own relationship issues. The author's self-serving motive (to reduce competition) complicates the ethics here. It's possible they used the \"helping\" angle as a cover for their own goals.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might have intended to help but crossed an ethical line by interfering in someone else's relationship based on their own interests. Even if the outcome was positive, the method was wrong. So answer A (wrong) or B (not wrong)? It's a tough call. But since the action involved revealing private thoughts and self-interest, the author is likely in the wrong. So A.\n"
