My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking whether they're at fault for breaking up a couple by telling them what they each thought of the other. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is part of a debate team and plans to run for co-captain with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another team, James and Mary, who are a couple but from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy with each other. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. Did the author have the right to intervene in their relationship? Well, they weren't close to James or Mary, just had casual talks. By revealing each other's negative thoughts, the author caused a public breakup. But the couple was already unhappy and stayed together because of the debate partnership. The author's intention was likely to help them realize the incompatibility. However, relationships are private, and even if there's unhappiness, it's not up to others to interfere unless there's harm. \n\nBut in this case, the couple's continued relationship might be affecting their performance in debate, which is a shared activity. The author was competing, so maybe they felt it was in their interest to prevent the competition from being a united front. But that's a conflict of interest. The author might have acted out of self-interest rather than genuine concern. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was genuinely unhappy and the author's action led to a breakup that they both needed, maybe it's a positive outcome. However, the method was problematic. The author didn't consult with them, just shared the opinions, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intentions were good, the action was invasive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't have the right to meddle in the couple's private matters. Even if the outcome was good, the act of revealing such personal thoughts without permission is a violation of privacy and trust. Relationships are complex, and others shouldn't act as arbiters. The author's actions were meddling and could be seen as manipulative, especially given the competitive context. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
