My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The user's partner is running for co-captain with them, and their main competition is a couple who are from different social groups. The author thought the couple was unhappy but didn't want to break up because of their debate partnership. So the author told each of them what the other thought, leading to an argument and a breakup.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the ethics of interfering in someone else's relationship. The author's reasoning was that the couple was incompatible and that being together was making them unhappy. But James was upset and blamed the author. The rest of the team agreed it was a favor. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by ending a toxic situation. On the other hand, they didn't ask if the couple wanted to know each other's thoughts, and they took it upon themselves to act, which could be seen as invasive. Trust and consent are important in relationships. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role in revealing private thoughts without permission could be problematic. \n\nBut maybe the author had good intentions. However, relationships are complex, and one person's perspective might not capture the whole picture. The author might have overstepped by not considering the couple's autonomy. Even if the outcome was positive, the method might be questionable. \n\nSo, the answer could go either way. But considering that the author meddled without being asked and caused public embarrassment (James crying in a meeting), it might be seen as the author is in the wrong. Even if the result was good, the means weren't appropriate. So I think the answer is A.\n"
