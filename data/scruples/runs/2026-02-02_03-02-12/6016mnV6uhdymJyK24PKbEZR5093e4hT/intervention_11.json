My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought of them. I need to decide between answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the situation. The author is on a debate team and their partner Tim is running for co-captains with them. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple but from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't really happy in their relationship but stay together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was doing them a favor.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author had information that the couple wasn't happy, their incompatibility was affecting their relationship, and the author's intervention caused the breakup. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, this is a tricky situation. On one hand, the author might have genuinely believed that breaking the couple up would allow James and Mary to be happier, not having to stay together for a partnership reason. They might have thought they were helping by revealing the truth. On the other hand, the author didn't have the right to meddle in their private relationship. Relationships are personal, and even if the author thought they were helping, they didn't have permission to act as a mediator. Also, causing a public breakup could be seen as invasive and harmful, especially if it was done without considering the emotional impact.\n\nBut there's also the context of the competition. The author is trying to position themselves and their partner for co-captain roles. There's a potential conflict of interest here. Did the author act out of genuine concern for James and Mary, or was there an ulterior motive to eliminate the competition? The post mentions that the author anticipates James and Mary being a strong competition because they can get votes from both social groups. If the author's primary motive was to weaken the competition rather than genuinely helping the couple, that could be seen as manipulative and inconsiderate.\n\nThe response from others in the debate team supports the author, saying they were doing a favor. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. The author's actions could have violated trust and privacy. Even if the result was a breakup that some saw as positive, the method was questionable. People can have good intentions but still be wrong in their methods.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the author in the first place. As a teammate, the author might not be in a position to act as a relationship counselor. Relationships are complex, and even if there are issues, it's up to the individuals involved to address them. The author's intervention might have been overstepping their boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might have been to help, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent and causing a public breakup is likely inconsiderate and possibly in the wrong. The potential motive of competition might also taint the action, making it more about self-interest than genuine concern. Therefore, the author is probably at fault here.\n"
