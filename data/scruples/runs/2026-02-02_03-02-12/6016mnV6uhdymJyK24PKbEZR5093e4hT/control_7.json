My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing by breaking up James and Mary. First, the situation is that the author is part of a debate team and their partner is running for co-captains with them. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author learned that James and Mary aren't happy with each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told them what the other thought, which led to an argument and a breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to help James and Mary by ending their unhappy relationship. The result was that they broke up, and while James was upset, others thought the author did the right thing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have thought they were doing a favor by revealing the truth, leading to the couple's breakup. If the relationship was already strained and the couple wasn't happy, maybe ending it was the right move. The fact that others agreed with the author suggests that the team saw the relationship as harmful to their dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by meddling in James and Mary's personal lives. Relationships are complex, and even if there are incompatibilities, it's up to the individuals to decide their future. Telling them what the author overheard could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Also, causing a public argument in the debate meeting might have been unkind to James, especially if he was emotionally affected.\n\nBut wait, the author's motivation was to help them realize their incompatibility. If they were staying together solely for debate politics, maybe the author felt it was necessary to break that up to let them form genuine partnerships. The outcome was that the team might be better off with more compatible leaders, and the breakup was a result of honest information.\n\nHowever, there's a line between giving advice and causing harm. The author might not have considered how the information was delivered or the emotional impact. Even if the intentions were good, the method could be problematic. Relationships are personal, and the author might not have the right to act as a mediator here.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to intervene. Since the author is part of the competition, there might be a conflict of interest. They might have acted out of self-interest to eliminate competition, but presented it as helping the team. If the breakup was genuinely for the couple's well-being, then maybe it's justified. But if the author's primary motive was to weaken their competition, then it's manipulative.\n\nThe story says that the author thought the joint ticket of James and Mary could get more votes, so breaking them up could reduce their competition. However, the author's own team might benefit from this. So, there's a possible ulterior motive here. Even if the author believed they were helping, the action might have been self-serving, which complicates their position.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple in the long run, the author's intervention was unauthorized and potentially harmful. The personal nature of the information and the public breakup could have caused unnecessary emotional distress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for meddling in a personal relationship for strategic reasons.\n"
