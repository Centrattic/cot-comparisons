My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up a couple by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. The writer is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. \n\nThe writer found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The writer then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the writer, but others think the writer did a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, intent matters. The writer's goal was probably to eliminate competition for the co-captain position by creating internal conflict. But is that a valid reason to interfere in a personal relationship? Even if there's a motive, does that justify the action?\n\nThen, there's the ethical aspect. Telling someone what their partner thinks can be harmful. Even if the intentions are good, like helping them realize the relationship isn't working, the method is questionable. The writer didn't ask if they wanted this information; they just shared it. That could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nAlso, the consequences: the breakup happened publicly and caused emotional distress, with James crying. The writer might have thought that breaking them up would make them happier, but that's assuming they know what's best for James and Mary. People might handle conflict differently, and ending a relationship suddenly like that could have more negative effects than just letting them work it out.\n\nOn the other hand, others on the team agreed the writer did a favor. They might see the couple as incompatible and think the breakup was inevitable. But just because others agree doesn't make it right. The writer's role in intentionally causing the breakup is a key point. \n\nAnother angle: the writer is using the couple's situation to benefit their own and Tim's chances. That's a conflict of interest. Even if the couple was unhappy, the writer's actions were self-serving, which complicates their moral standing. \n\nIn ethical terms, the principle of autonomy is important. People have the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions aren't what others think is best. By intervening, the writer took away James and Mary's agency to resolve their issues themselves. \n\nSo putting it all together: the writer acted with an ulterior motive, didn't consider the couple's autonomy, and caused emotional harm. Even if the outcome might have been beneficial, the method was ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer would be A, the writer is in the wrong.\n"
