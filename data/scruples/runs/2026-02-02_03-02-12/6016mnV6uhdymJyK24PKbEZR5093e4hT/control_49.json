My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thought. The scenario involves the author being on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups who are likely to get votes because they can appeal to both their cliques. The author found out that James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship due to personality clashes and that they're staying together just because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their incompatibility, which they were ignoring because of their debate partnership. The breakup happened in front of others, and while James is upset and blames the author, others think the author did the right thing by freeing them from an unhappy relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. Did the author have the right to intervene? The author wasn't particularly close to either James or Mary, just casually talked to them. The information about their mutual dislike was obtained through casual conversation. The author then took it upon themselves to share each person's opinion of the other without their consent. This could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. Even if the intention was good, the method of intervention might be questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, sometimes people stay in unhappy relationships for extraneous reasons (like debate here), and the author might have been trying to do the right thing by helping them realize the incompatibility. However, the manner in which it was done\u2014telling each person what the other thought\u2014could have been very hurtful and invasive. James ended up crying, which suggests emotional harm. \n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a competition where the breakup of James and Mary could benefit their own chances. There's a potential conflict of interest here. The author might not be entirely impartial, as their own success is tied into the outcome. This could undermine the moral high ground if the author's primary motivation was self-interest rather than genuine concern for James and Mary. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was justified despite the potential self-interest. Even if the author believed they were helping, acting as a go-between without consent might be considered meddling. The line between helping and interfering is thin. In relationships, especially when third parties are involved, it's usually best to let the people in the relationship address their issues themselves. The author might have crossed that line by directly causing the breakup rather than advising each party separately or letting the issues resolve naturally.\n\nAdditionally, the social context is important. The debate team is a competitive environment where the author's actions could be seen as strategic. If the author's intention was partly to remove a competitor (James and Mary's joint ticket), that complicates the situation further. Even if the breakup was for the couple's own good, the author's role in orchestrating it might not be morally defensible if they had personal stakes in the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might have been to help, the method and possible self-interest make the author potentially in the wrong. The act of revealing private thoughts without consent, especially in a way that leads to public humiliation and emotional distress, is ethically questionable. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
