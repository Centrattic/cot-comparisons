My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up the couple by telling them what each other thought is in the wrong. The situation is about high school debate team co-captain elections.\n\nSo the main points here: The author is part of a debate team and their partner is their friend from before high school. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because they need each other for debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which caused a breakup. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention was likely to help them by ending a forced relationship. But was it their right to do so? Relationships are personal, and even if they're unhappy, others shouldn't meddle unless there's a good reason. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests that the action caused immediate harm. However, others on the team agreed it was a favor because the couple was incompatible but stayed together for strategic reasons.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, the author might have acted out of a desire to help them be honest and maybe form better partnerships. On the other hand, breaking up a relationship, even if it's unhappy, is a big decision and shouldn't be forced by others. The author didn't ask for permission to intervene, and their action led to public conflict and emotional distress. \n\nBut then again, if the couple was already considering breaking up but didn't want to because of debate, maybe the author just accelerated the inevitable. But was it right to do it in a public setting during a meeting? That could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong here, but morally, the author might have overstepped. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the method was intrusive. The author might have crossed a boundary by revealing private sentiments without consent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they meddled in others' private matters, even with good intentions. But others might argue that they did the right thing by ending a harmful situation. The key factors are consent and the method used. Since the author didn't get consent and acted in a public, confrontational way, it's more likely they are at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
