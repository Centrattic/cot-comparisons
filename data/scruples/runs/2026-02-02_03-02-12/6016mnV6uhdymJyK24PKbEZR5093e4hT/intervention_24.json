My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up a couple by revealing their true thoughts of each other. The author is on a debate team and trying to secure co-captain positions with their partner Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author noticed that neither James nor Mary are happy in the relationship but stay together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical implications here. The author's intention was to help them realize they're incompatible and not happy. But they crossed a line by disclosing private thoughts without consent. Even if the outcome was positive (breaking up because they were unhappy), the means were deceitful. Trust is a big factor here\u2014without the author's intervention, James and Mary might have stayed together, but maybe they would have realized their incompatibility on their own eventually.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions led to the breakup, which freed both parties from a harmful situation. The friends supported the author, thinking it was a favor. But on the other hand, the author meddled in their personal lives without their consent. Spreading someone's private thoughts about another person is a breach of trust, even if the author's motives were good. The fact that James was upset and blamed the author shows the emotional impact. The author might have wanted to help, but the method was inappropriate. \n\nI should consider if there were other ways to approach this. Maybe encouraging them to talk to each other rather than acting as a mediator. Meddling in relationships often leads to unintended consequences, and the author might not have considered the emotional toll. Even if the end result seems positive, the action was unethical because it involved sharing private information without consent. The author's role as a debater involves critical thinking and strategy, but not necessarily intervening in personal matters. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have benefited James and Mary, the method used by the author was wrong. The right thing to do would have been to let them work out their issues themselves or suggest a mediated conversation. The author overstepped their bounds, making them at fault despite the positive outcome.\n"
