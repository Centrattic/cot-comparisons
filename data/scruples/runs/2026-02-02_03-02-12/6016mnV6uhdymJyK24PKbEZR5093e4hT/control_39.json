My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. They have a rival team that's a couple, James and Mary. The author overheard that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument during a meeting.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects. The key points here are intent and consequences. The author's intention was to help them by revealing the mutual negative thoughts, which others thought was a favor. The consequence was the breakup, hurting James, but others agreed it was for the best since the relationship was incompatible.\n\nBut did the author have the right to interfere? Relationships are private, and sharing someone's private thoughts without consent can be seen as a violation of trust. Even if the author thought it was for the best, they didn't ask for permission. The act of revealing such information can lead to emotional harm, as seen with James crying. However, the other side is that the couple was unhappy and the breakup might have been inevitable. The debate team also saw it as a favor, suggesting the community supported the action.\n\nHowever, the ethical dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the outcome was positive, was it right to use that method? People have a right to privacy, and the author's action crossed into that personal space. The author might not be malicious, but the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the outcome. So, even if the result was good, the method was unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
