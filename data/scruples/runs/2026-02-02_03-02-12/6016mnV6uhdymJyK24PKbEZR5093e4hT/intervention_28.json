My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. The scenario involves the author being on the debate team, trying to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author discovered that neither James nor Mary is happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their incompatibility, which others agreed was a favor. However, the method used was direct and led to public embarrassment and emotional distress, with James crying. The question is whether the ends justify the means.\n\nFrom a deontological standpoint, lying or manipulating others is wrong regardless of the outcome. But here, the author didn't lie; they conveyed truthful negative opinions. However, the author's role in the situation is important. They weren't close friends with either James or Mary, so maybe they overstepped by acting as a mediator. \n\nUtilitarian perspective: the action had a positive outcome (ending an unhappy relationship) with potential negative consequences (public breakup, emotional harm). But the author's motive was strategic to weaken the competition. That complicates things because the benefit might be self-serving rather than altruistic. \n\nAnother angle is consent. Neither James nor Mary asked for their partner's thoughts to be relayed. The author didn't have the right to share personal opinions, even if they were true. This could be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. \n\nAlso, the situation is a high school debate team, so the social dynamics and peer opinions play a role. The team's approval might not exonerate the author; groupthink can sometimes overlook individual ethics. \n\nThe key factors are the author's intent (helping vs. undermining competition) and the method (truth-telling without consent). Even if the result was good, the lack of consent and the emotional impact could make the author at fault. Alternatively, if the author genuinely believed they were helping, it might not be their fault. \n\nBut considering that the author is part of the debate team and possibly using this as a strategy to increase their chances of winning co-captain, the action might be seen as underhanded. The ethical dilemma here is whether the author's personal gain justifies the action, which it usually doesn't. \n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they meddled in others' relationships without consent, even if the outcome was positive. But some might argue they weren't in the wrong (B) since they exposed an unhappy relationship. However, the lack of consent and the strategic motive could tip the scales towards A.\n"
