My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The situation involves a debate team where the author is considering running for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author knows that they're not happy in their relationship but staying together because of debate. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nHmm. So the key points here: did the author do the right thing by intervening? Well, James and Mary were in an unhappy relationship, possibly staying together just because of their debate partnership. The author had information from conversations with each of them about their negative perceptions of each other. By sharing that info, the author caused them to break up, which made James cry and blame the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help them realize they're incompatible, leading to a breakup. But did they have the right to meddle in their relationship? In relationships, honesty is important, but revealing someone else's negative opinions without consent can be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author believed it was for their good, withholding such information could have kept the couple together out of obligation, not genuine compatibility. However, the author's motivation was to help them be honest with themselves, which might be seen as a positive intent. But the method\u2014spilling the beans without talking to both sides first\u2014might have been harsh.\n\nAlso, the context of debate and the competition adds another layer. The author might have felt that breaking up the couple would help their own team's chances, but they didn't state that as their reason. Their stated reason was concern for the couple's well-being. The outcome was that the couple broke up, which others agreed was a good thing. \n\nBut is it right to interfere? Maybe not. The author didn't confront James and Mary directly or suggest they talk to each other. Instead, they just told each one what the other thought, leading to a public argument and breakup. That could be seen as meddling, even with good intentions. Relationships require communication, and the author's action might have forced that communication, but in a way that could be seen as invasive.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the result was positive (they were incompatible and unhappy), the method of intervention might be questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't let the couple work through their issues themselves. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But some might argue that they were doing a favor. However, the ethical aspect here is about respecting others' privacy and autonomy. The author didn't have the right to share personal opinions between the couple without their consent. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
