My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their true feelings. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is another team, James and Mary, who are a couple. The author noticed that James and Mary each have negative opinions about each other but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor because the couple was incompatible.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the action here is revealing private thoughts that the couple wasn't sharing with each other. The author's motive was to help them realize their incompatibility, which others agreed with. But did the author have the right to interfere? Let's consider the factors.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not have been in a position to know their private thoughts unless they were confided in. If the author overheard or guessed incorrectly, that's a problem. But according to the scenario, the author had casual conversations where these feelings were expressed. If the author was told in confidence, then sharing that information without consent could be an issue. Even if it's true, spreading such information can be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was unhappy and staying together for the sake of their partnership. The author's intervention led to a breakup that might have been inevitable but delayed. Others on the team supported the action, seeing it as a kindness. However, the method of intervention\u2014publicly revealing private thoughts during a meeting\u2014could have been handled more sensitively. The fact that it caused an argument and emotional distress (James crying) suggests that the approach might have been harsh.\n\nEthically, even if the outcome was positive (the breakup), the means involved betraying confidences. The author might have a responsibility to maintain confidentiality if the information was shared privately. Unless there was explicit permission to share, it's a breach of trust. Also, the author's own motives might be questioned\u2014are they acting in the couple's best interest or trying to eliminate competition for the co-captain position? The scenario mentions the author is competing against them, which might introduce bias in their judgment about the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple, the method of intervention involved violating their privacy and trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
