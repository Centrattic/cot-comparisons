My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone on a debate team who broke up a couple by telling each their partner's true thoughts. The key points here are the motives, the context, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation: they're concerned about their partnership for co-captains and see the couple as competition. They believe the couple's different social groups give them an advantage in gathering votes. The author didn't have a personal vendetta against them but saw the relationship as a hindrance to their partnership and wanted to disrupt it. However, their justification is that the couple wasn't happy together and was staying together for debate, not the relationship itself.\n\nNext, the action taken: the author told each person what the other thought negatively of them. This led to a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the author. The rest of the team thought the author was doing them a favor, as the couple was incompatible and their unhappiness was evident.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intent was to undermine the competition, which is a bit self-serving. Even if the couple was unhappy, using that information to manipulate their relationship for personal gain (to win the co-captain election) is problematic. The author didn't ask the couple for their permission or consider the emotional impact. Relationships are personal, and intervening in them, especially for personal gain, can be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the outcome was positive (the couple breaking up and being happier), the means used were manipulative. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were helping the couple by revealing mutual dissatisfaction, which led to their breakup. But the ethical issue here is the method. The author had no right to act as a mediator or to expose the couple's private opinions without their consent. The self-serving motive complicates things, as it's not purely altruistic. Even if others agreed the couple was incompatible, the author's role in causing the breakup was intentional and for strategic reasons, which can be seen as exploiting the situation for their own benefit.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were manipulative and taken for personal gain, even if the result was positive. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
