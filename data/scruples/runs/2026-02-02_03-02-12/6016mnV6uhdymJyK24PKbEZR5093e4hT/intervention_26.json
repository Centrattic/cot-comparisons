My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is on the debate team and their partner is running for co-captains with them. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which caused them to break up right then and there. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The author's reasoning is that they were incompatible but stayed together for debate, so breaking them up might have helped them. But James is upset, so maybe the author overstepped?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points here. The author had information about how each partner viewed the other. They decided to share that information with both parties, leading to the breakup. The outcome was that the couple broke up, which caused James to cry and blame the author. Others agreed with the author, saying it was a favor because they were unhappy.\n\nBut wait, is it ethical to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if you think you're helping? The author might have thought they were doing a good deed by ending the unhappy relationship. However, relationships are personal, and even if two people are unhappy, it's their decision to end it. The author didn't ask for permission to meddle; they just acted on their own judgment. \n\nAlso, the motivation here is possibly strategic. The author's team is competing against James and Mary for co-captains. If breaking up the couple weakens their competition, maybe the author had a self-interested motive. But the author claims it was to help them. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of ethics, revealing someone's private thoughts without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the information was true, sharing it could be harmful. The fact that James was crying suggests that the action had a significant emotional impact. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the author might have crossed a line by not respecting the couple's autonomy to decide their own relationship's fate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in the relationship without justification, even if it led to a positive outcome. The intent might matter here, but the action itself could be seen as overstepping.\n"
