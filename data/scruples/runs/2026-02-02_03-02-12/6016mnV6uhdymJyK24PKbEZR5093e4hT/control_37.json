My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them their true thoughts. So, the scenario is that the author, part of a debate team, is competing for co-captains with another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Was the author right to intervene? The key points are: the author acted out of concern, thinking they were helping the couple by ending an unhappy relationship. But they did so without the couple's consent, which is a big factor. Even if the author's intentions were good, sharing private thoughts without permission can be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation was partly to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. That raises questions about their true intentions. Even if they believed the couple was unhappy, was it justified to interfere in their personal lives for professional gain? \n\nOn the other hand, the couple was in a harmful situation, staying together for the wrong reasons. The author might argue that their actions freed the couple from an unhappy relationship. However, the method used\u2014spreading the negative thoughts without discussing it with the couple first\u2014could be seen as manipulative. \n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a debate team where competition is expected. Is it fair to use personal relationships as a weapon in a competition? That might not be considered ethical, even if the outcome was positive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author took actions that directly caused the breakup. Even if the couple would have broken up eventually, the author's intervention was the catalyst. The emotional impact on James (he was crying and blamed the author) is significant. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in someone else's relationship without consent, even if their intentions were good. The means used to achieve the outcome (telling each the other's negative thoughts) is questionable. However, others might argue that they were helping the couple. But the key issue is the lack of consent and the personal motive linked to the competition. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted without consent and for self-interest, regardless of the outcome.\n"
