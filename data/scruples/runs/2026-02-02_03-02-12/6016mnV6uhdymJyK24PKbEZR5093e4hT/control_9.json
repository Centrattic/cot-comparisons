My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is part of a debate team and wants to become co-captains. Their partner, Tim, is a better debater, but the person is better at politics and writing. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the ethics here. The author had information about the couple's private thoughts and decided to share it, causing a public breakup. Even though they might have thought it was for the couple's own good, did they have the right to do that without their consent? \n\nOn one hand, the couple was unhappy but staying together due to their partnership. The author's action led to them breaking up, which some might see as helping them realize their incompatibility. However, sharing private opinions without permission can be seen as a breach of trust and privacy. Publicly causing a breakup might have been harsh, even if the intention was good. \n\nThe debate team's reaction says others agreed it was a favor, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. The author's role in the situation could be seen as overstepping, especially if they weren't close friends to James and Mary. The key points here are consent and the method used. Even if the outcome was positive, the means were intrusive and could have been handled more privately. \n\nSo, while the intention might have been to help, the execution was problematic. The author didn't have the right to share that information without the couple's consent, leading to a public humiliation and breakup. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
