My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up a couple by revealing their negative thoughts about each other. The author is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that neither James nor Mary is happy in their relationship but they stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down. First, the author's motivation: they wanted to help James and Mary realize they're incompatible and that their relationship is affecting their partnership and happiness. But they did it by telling each other the negative opinions, which directly caused a breakup. \n\nOn one hand, the author might say they were doing a favor by ending a harmful situation where both were unhappy. The other members of the debate team agreed. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked. Relationships are personal, and even if they were unhappy, the couple should decide their own fate. The author's actions could be seen as interfering for personal gain (to reduce competition) rather than genuine concern.\n\nBut the author claims they were trying to help, not sabotage. They might have believed the couple's happiness was more important than their partnership. However, the method of intervention is questionable. Telling each other the negative thoughts directly could be seen as causing harm, even if the outcome was a breakup. Relationships are complex, and the couple might have wanted to work things out on their own terms. The author's action, while well-intentioned, might have been a breach of trust and privacy.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a high school debate team, the author's role as a debate team member might involve strategic thinking, but this is a personal matter. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests that the action was hurtful. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the immediate emotional impact is significant. \n\nIn ethical terms, the principle of autonomy is important. The couple has the right to make their own decisions, even if they're unhappy. The author might have thought they knew better, but forcing the issue could be seen as unethical. Additionally, the author's potential bias in wanting to eliminate competition could cloud their judgment, making their intentions seem self-serving.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions (helping the couple) against the method (interfering without consent) and the consequences (public breakup, emotional distress), it's possible the author is in the wrong. Even if the outcome was positive for the team dynamics, the means used were inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
