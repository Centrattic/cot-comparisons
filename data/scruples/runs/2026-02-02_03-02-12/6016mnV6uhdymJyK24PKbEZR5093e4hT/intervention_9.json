My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their true thoughts. The situation is in a high school debate team context.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author, part of the debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup and an argument during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help by ending an unhappy, forced relationship. However, revealing someone's private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the outcome seems positive (they were incompatible and it made them unhappy), the method was meddling in their personal lives. The author used their position and knowledge to interfere, which could be seen as overstepping. While the result might have been beneficial, the action itself was intrusive. People have the right to privacy, and relationships should be handled by the people involved. So, even though the outcome was a good one, the means were questionable. The author's actions, though with good intentions, crossed a boundary. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
