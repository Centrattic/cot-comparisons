My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is on a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that neither James nor Mary are actually happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought about them, which led to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They say they did this because they thought it would help James and Mary by ending their unhappy relationship, which others on the team seemed to agree with. But James was upset and blamed the author. So, the question is whether the author overstepped by revealing the negative thoughts.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have believed they were helping by ending a harmful situation. If the couple was unhappy and staying together only for strategic reasons (debate partnership), maybe breaking them up would be kind. The team's support suggests others saw it that way. Also, the author isn't friends with either of them, so maybe their judgment isn't biased by personal relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author took it upon themselves to meddle in a personal relationship without being asked. Even if the couple's issues were affecting their debate partnership, it's not clear if the author had the right to intervene like that. Spreading or revealing private thoughts can be seen as a violation of trust, even if the intent was good. James was crying and blamed the author, which shows the emotional impact. The author might have caused unintended harm, even if their goal was noble.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a school debate team, the author's actions could be seen as manipulative, especially if the breakup affects the competition. There's a line between healthy competition and underhanded tactics. The author's motivation might not be purely altruistic if it benefits their own chances for co-captain. That could make their actions seem self-serving, which complicates the morality of their decision.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respecting people's privacy and autonomy. The couple might have chosen to stay together despite their issues for their own reasons, and the author's intervention could have stripped them of that choice. Even if the relationship was unhappy, the decision to end it should be mutual, not forced by someone else's actions.\n\nSo, while the outcome (a breakup) might have been seen as positive by others, the method used by the author could be considered wrong. They didn't ask for consent, didn't give the couple a chance to address their issues themselves, and possibly used the information to gain a competitive edge. This makes the author's actions questionable, even if the result was a happy ending for some. The key issue here is the breach of trust and the lack of respect for the couple's autonomy in their relationship decisions.\n"
