My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The scenario is that the author is on a debate team and their partner is planning to run for co-captains. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary had issues with each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup.\n\nHmm. The first thing I need to consider is whether the author had the right to intervene. Relationships can be complicated, and even if the couple isn't happy, it's not always one person's fault. The author's intention was to help them realize they were incompatible, but did they have the right to expose each other's negative opinions? \n\nI remember that in some cases, people might do this out of good intentions, thinking they're doing the couple a favor. But relationships are personal, and even if the couple is unhappy, the author isn't in a position to decide for them. Also, by revealing each other's thoughts, the author might have breached trust or confidentiality. Even if the couple was hiding their true feelings, sharing that information could be seen as a violation.\n\nAnother angle is the consequence. The breakup caused an argument and emotional distress. James was crying and blamed the author. While others on the team might agree it was a favor, the immediate impact was negative. The author might have acted out of a desire to help their own partnership's chances, which could introduce self-interest into the situation. That might make their actions more questionable, as the author's motives weren't entirely altruistic.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the couple was using the relationship for strategic reasons rather than genuine compatibility. If they were unhappy but staying together for debate, the author might have seen an opportunity to free them from a harmful situation. However, even if that's the case, the method of intervention matters. Instead of directly revealing the criticisms, maybe they could have encouraged the couple to communicate with each other directly.\n\nAlso, the author's role as a debate team member might influence their perspective. They might be focused on forming the best possible partnership, and disrupting the competition's unity could be a strategic move. But that seems like manipulation for personal gain, which can be ethically questionable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is usually valued, but there's also the concept of \"harm principle\" where actions that cause harm are not justified unless the benefits are significant. Here, the harm caused by breaking up the couple might outweigh the benefits of forming a more compatible partnership, even if the original relationship was unhappy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without consent, potentially causing unnecessary harm. Even if the outcome was that the couple broke up, the method involved deception or betrayal of trust. The author's actions were based on their own strategic interests rather than the couple's best interests, which complicates the moral justification.\n"
