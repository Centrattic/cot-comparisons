My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competitors are a couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because they need each other for debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author had information about how each partner viewed the other negatively and decided to share it. The result was a public breakup that upset James, who blamed the author. However, others thought it was a favor because they were incompatible and staying together for debate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Telling someone what another person thinks about them, especially if it's negative, can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have assumed that the couple wasn't honest with each other and that the author's intervention was for their own good. But was it the author's place to do this? Even if the author thought they were helping, by revealing those thoughts, they might have crossed a boundary. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple was using debate as a reason to stay together, the author's role isn't to meddle unless they have permission. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was trying to help by ending a harmful situation. The couple's unhappiness could affect their performance and well-being. But did the author have the right to interfere? The author isn't a therapist or a mediator, just a teammate. The action taken was direct and caused public embarrassment and emotional distress, which could have been avoided with a more private approach or letting the couple work it out themselves.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be questioned. Were they acting purely out of concern for the couple, or was there an ulterior motive related to their own campaign for co-captains? If the breakup removes a competitor, maybe the author had self-interest. That could taint the action, making it less about helping and more about strategic advantage.\n\nIn terms of consequences, while the breakup resolved the incompatibility, it was done in a way that was public and hurtful. James was crying, indicating that the method was harsh. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the manner of the intervention is questionable. The author might have handled it differently if they wanted to help, like talking to each person separately and letting them decide, rather than exposing the thoughts directly.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they overstepped their role, acted without considering the personal boundaries of the couple, and potentially acted out of self-interest. Even if the outcome was positive, the method and intent might not justify the action.\n"
