My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true thoughts. The scenario is about a debate team where the author is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author knew that neither was happy in the relationship but they stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author acted as a mediator or intervener without being asked. They had information that both parties were unhappy but didn't confront each other. By revealing each other's negative thoughts, they caused an immediate breakup, which the author claims was for their benefit. However, James was upset and blamed the author, while others thought it was a favor.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping the couple by ending an unhappy relationship that was maintaining only for external reasons (debate partnership). On the other hand, the author didn't have consent from either James or Mary to act as a go-between. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple was unhappy, it's not the author's place to intervene without permission. The author's actions could be seen as violating their privacy and trust, especially if the information was obtained through casual conversations. Also, the immediate breakup during a meeting might have caused unnecessary public embarrassment, which is unkind.\n\nBut then again, the couple's incompatibility was affecting their partnership and possibly their performance. The author's intent might have been good, thinking that an unhappy relationship would hinder their debate team. However, relationships are complex, and even if they were unhappy, the decision to break up should be theirs to make, not someone else's. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the main issue is consent and the right to intervene. The author didn't have the authority to act as a matchmaker or breakup mediator. Even with good intentions, the method was intrusive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled without permission, leading to public confrontation and emotional distress for James. However, some might argue that they helped a situation that was already unsustainable. But I think the consensus here is that the author shouldn't have done that. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
