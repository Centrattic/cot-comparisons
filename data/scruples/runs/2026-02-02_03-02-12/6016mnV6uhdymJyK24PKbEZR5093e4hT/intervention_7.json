My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post did something wrong by telling a couple what they thought of each other, leading to a breakup. The author is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author noticed that while James and Mary were in a relationship, they actually didn't get along well and were staying together for debate reasons. The author told each of them what they thought of the other, which caused a public argument and breakup.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is at fault here. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author had information that James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then acted on that information by revealing each other's negative perceptions, leading to a breakup. The user argues that the breakup was for the better because they were incompatible and the breakup made them unhappy. Others in the debate team agreed with the author. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nNow, considering ethics. Telling someone what another person thinks about them can be a breach of trust. The author didn't ask for permission to share that information. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author had a role as a friend or teammate, not as a matchmaker. The author's motivation might be competition for the co-captain position, which could introduce bias. The action caused emotional harm (James was crying), which is significant. However, the outcome was that the couple broke up because they weren't happy, so maybe it was a good outcome in the long run.\n\nBut is it the author's place to interfere? People might argue that the author overstepped their bounds. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent can damage relationships. The author might have thought they were helping, but without the couple's consent, it's a violation of privacy. On the other hand, if the couple was in a harmful situation, maybe the author did the right thing. But the line between helping and interference is thin here.\n\nAlso, the author's own competition for co-captains suggests there might be an ulterior motive. Even if the author didn't intend to sabotage the couple, the action could be seen as strategic to remove competition. That makes the situation more complex. If the author had purely altruistic reasons, it might be different, but mixed motives can affect judgment.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, breaking up a couple in a public setting during a meeting is harsh. It's possible that the author didn't consider the emotional impact on James and Mary. Even if others agreed it was a favor, causing public embarrassment and emotional distress is a serious action. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was good, but the method was poor. However, intent vs. impact is a common debate in ethics. The impact here was negative, which could make the author responsible.\n\nSo, weighing the factors: the author acted without consent, potentially out of competitive motives, caused public emotional harm, but the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple's happiness. Different people might judge this differently. Some would say the author overstepped, others might see it as a necessary intervention. In the context of the AITA subreddit, often the consensus leans on the side of not being at fault if the action had a positive outcome, but the method might be questioned. However, the emotional impact on James is a key point here. The answer could go either way, but I need to decide based on ethical considerations.\n"
