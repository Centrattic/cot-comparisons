My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by revealing each other's negative thoughts to the couple James and Mary.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is on a debate team and wants to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author feels that their relationship is inconsiderate because they're staying together only for the sake of their debate partnership, not because they really like each other. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nThe key points here are about intent and consequences. The author's intention was to help them by being honest, as they believed the relationship was harmful. However, the act of revealing personal thoughts without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy and trust. Even if the outcome was a breakup, which others might see as positive, the method used was direct and potentially hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, especially romantic ones, people often keep their negative opinions private. Sharing that information without permission can lead to emotional harm, as seen when James was crying and directly blamed the author. While others on the debate team might agree it was a favor, the author's actions crossed a line by interfering in a personal matter without consent. \n\nEthically, respecting others' privacy and autonomy is important. The author had no right to meddle in James and Mary's relationship unless they were explicitly asked for advice. Even if the relationship was unhealthy, the decision to end it should come from the couple themselves, not an outside party revealing secrets. \n\nSo, considering the breach of trust and the emotional impact, the author's actions were inappropriate. They acted in their own interest (to beat the competition) and made a judgment about the couple's relationship without fully understanding their situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
