My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's negative thoughts. The scenario is about high school debate team co-captain elections.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is part of a debate team and is planning to run with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author discovered that their relationship isn't happy, and both have negative opinions about each other. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author was doing them a favor.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intent was to help by exposing the incompatibility, but the method was direct and caused immediate conflict. The question is whether the author overstepped by revealing private thoughts without consent.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty is important, but so is respecting privacy and relationships. The author might have thought they were helping, but intentionally revealing someone's private opinions without their permission could be considered meddling. Even if the relationship was unhappy, the author doesn't have the right to act as a mediator or enforcer. The breakup happened during a public event (a debate meeting), which could have been traumatic for James, especially if he was crying. The author's actions might have crossed a line, even if the outcome was the breakup of an unhappy relationship.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the couple stayed together only for strategic reasons (debate partnership) and the author's action freed them. But the method used is still questionable. The answer hinges on whether the author had the right to intervene in that way. Since the author didn't ask for permission and caused a public scene, it's likely that they are in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
