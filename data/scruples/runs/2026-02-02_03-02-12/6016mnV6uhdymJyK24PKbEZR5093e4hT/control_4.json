My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captain with their partner, Tim. They mention that Tim is a better debater, but the author is better at writing and politics, which is important for the position. The main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author knows that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nHmm. The key question here is whether the author overstepped by revealing what they believed were each other's negative thoughts. Let's break it down. First, the author's intent was to help James and Mary by making them aware of their incompatibility, which others agreed with. But was it their place to do so? Relationships are personal, and even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, sharing such information without consent could be considered a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the author is in a competitive position with James and Mary for the co-captain roles. There might be a conflict of interest here. Even if the author's actions led to the breakup because the couple was incompatible, the method of revealing this information could be problematic. The breakup happened in a public setting (middle of a debate meeting), and James was crying. That suggests the situation was handled poorly, maybe recklessly.\n\nBut then again, others on the team supported the author, thinking they did a favor. So maybe the author wasn't the only one who saw the incompatibility. However, the responsibility of mediating a breakup isn't typically up to a third party, especially in a competitive context. The author might have acted out of self-interest to weaken the competition, even if it's true that the couple was unhappy. \n\nEven if the intention was genuinely to help, the lack of consent and the context in which the information was shared are important factors. Relationships can be complex, and people might not be ready to face the truth even if it's for their own good. The author's role as a debater might involve critical analysis, but that doesn't extend to personal relationships. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they interfered in a personal relationship without the consent of the individuals involved, possibly using the information to gain an advantage in their own competition. Publicly causing a breakup in a meeting seems like a harsh way to handle it, regardless of the outcome. The ethical issue here is about respecting others' boundaries and privacy, even if the action leads to a positive result.\n"
