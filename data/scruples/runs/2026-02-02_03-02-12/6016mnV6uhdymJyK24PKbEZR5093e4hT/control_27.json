My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship but stay together because they need each other for debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to an argument and a breakup.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the right thing by breaking up the couple. The options are A (author is wrong) and B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author didn't have direct evidence that James and Mary were unhappy, just casual conversations. By sharing each other's negative opinions, they caused a public argument and breakup. The author's motivation was to eliminate competition for co-captains, but they justified it by saying it's helping them be happier. But was it their right to interfere in their personal relationship?\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were helping the couple realize their incompatibility. On the other hand, spreading other's private opinions without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's actions were meddling in their relationship, which could be seen as manipulative. Also, the breakup happened publicly during a meeting, which might have been embarrassing and hurtful, especially since James was crying and blamed the author. \n\nThe other team members agreed that the author was doing them a favor, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The author's actions might have been self-serving, as they wanted to weaken the competition. Even if the outcome was positive (the couple breaking up), the means of achieving it were questionable. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty and transparency are important, but so is respecting others' privacy and autonomy. The author didn't give James and Mary a chance to confront each other directly; instead, they took it upon themselves to act as a mediator. This could be seen as overstepping and causing unnecessary harm, even if the intention was good. \n\nTherefore, while the result might have been beneficial for the couple in the long run, the method used was inappropriate and possibly unethical. The author's actions could be considered wrong because they interfered in a personal relationship without consent, leading to emotional distress. So the answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
