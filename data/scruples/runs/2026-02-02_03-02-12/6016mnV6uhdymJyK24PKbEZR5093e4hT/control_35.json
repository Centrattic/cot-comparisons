  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they did something wrong by breaking up their friends who are also debate partners. The situation involves Tim and the author wanting to run for co-captains against James and Mary, who are a couple but not happy together. The author found out that James and Mary have negative opinions about each other and told each of them what the other thought. This led to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor because they were incompatible.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? First, the author's intention was to help by revealing the truth, maybe to make the competition easier. But they didn't consider the emotional impact on James and Mary. Relationships are complex, and even if they were unhappy, breaking them up can have serious consequences. The author didn't ask for permission or check if they wanted that information shared. It's meddling in others' personal lives, even if with good intentions. They might have crossed a line by using their position in the debate team to influence the competition. Also, the fact that it caused a public argument and James crying shows it was harsh. However, others saw it as a favor, so maybe the author believed they were doing the right thing. But regardless of intent, sharing private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. The author's role as a debater might emphasize strategy, but personal relationships should be respected. So, the author is in the wrong because they interfered without considering the consequences and the privacy of others.\n"
