My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. The situation is that they're part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their partner, Tim, is better at debate, but the author is better at writing and politics. The main competition is another team, James and Mary, who are a couple but come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't really like each other but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual dissatisfaction. They thought that by ending their forced relationship, they'd be doing the right thing because it was making them unhappy. The debate team members agreed with the author, thinking they were a favor. However, James blamed the author, and he was crying. \n\nBut wait, did the author have the right to interfere in their relationship? Even if they meant well, relationships are personal. The author might have thought they were helping, but relationships can be complex. Maybe James and Mary wanted to stay together despite their issues for the sake of the team, even if it wasn't perfect. The author assumed their unhappiness was the main issue, but there could be other factors they didn't consider. \n\nAlso, the author might have breached trust by revealing personal thoughts without consent. James and Mary might have shared those thoughts privately with the author, expecting confidentiality. By spreading that information, the author caused a public breakup, which could be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions led to a breakup that might have been inevitable. If the relationship was harmful in the long run, maybe ending it early was better. But the method of revealing personal information without consent is questionable. The author might not have considered the emotional impact, leading to James being upset. \n\nSo, the key points are intention vs. action. The intention was to help, but the action involved sharing private information, which is a breach of trust. Even if the outcome was positive, the means were problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their privacy, even if the result was seen as beneficial.\n"
