My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA?\" post) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. \n\nSo, the situation is that the author is part of a debate team and plans to run with their partner Tim for co-captains. The main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary actually don't like each other very much\u2014Mary thinks James is a \"big mouth, small brain,\" and James thinks Mary is too idealistic and boring. The author told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to help James and Mary by telling them the truth about each other's feelings. The author believed that the couple was staying together just because of their debate partnership, not because they were actually happy. The result was the breakup, which made James cry, but others thought it was a favor since they were incompatible.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author wasn't in a position to know the full context. They only had casual conversations with James and Mary. Did they misinterpret the situation? Maybe they took what they heard out of context. Also, the author's motivation might be related to trying to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. There's a conflict of interest here. Even if the author thought they were helping, their own interests could have influenced their actions.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people generally expect their private conversations and feelings to be confidential. Even if the author believed the couple was unhappy, it's not their place to act as a mediator or to spread information that could harm someone else's relationship. The author might have crossed a line by revealing personal thoughts without knowing the full story, leading to public embarrassment and emotional distress.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the couple wasn't truly in a healthy relationship and that breaking them up was actually beneficial. The fact that others on the team agreed with the author could support that view. But the method used\u2014telling each person what the other thought in a public setting\u2014might have been inconsiderate and rushed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions directly caused the breakup. Even if the outcome was positive (they were incompatible), the means were questionable. The author should have considered talking to the couple privately first to understand their perspectives and possibly help them work through their issues, rather than immediately sharing potentially damaging information. \n\nAlso, the author's own competition with the couple could have clouded their judgment. It's possible that the real motivation was to undermine the couple's partnership to gain an advantage in the elections, even if they framed it as helping the couple.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author acted without knowing the full context, used a public and harsh method, and may have had ulterior motives. Even if the result was a breakup that some saw as a good thing, the way it was handled was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
