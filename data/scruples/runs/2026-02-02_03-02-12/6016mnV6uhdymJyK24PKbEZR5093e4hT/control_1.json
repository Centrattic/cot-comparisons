My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they think of each other. The situation is set in a high school debate team where the author is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to an argument and breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's action was wrong. The key points here are the intent, the method, and the consequences. The author's intention was to help them realize they're incompatible so they can form better partnerships. The method was revealing personal thoughts without consent. The consequences were a public breakup causing emotional distress to James, who was crying, but others thought the author did a favor.\n\nEthically, people have a right to privacy and autonomy. By sharing what each person thought of the other, the author breached their privacy. Even if the information was true, the author didn't have the right to meddle in their relationship without their consent. The author might argue that it was for their benefit, but others' relationships are their own to manage, and intervening without being asked can be seen as overstepping. However, the outcome was positive in that the couple was indeed unhappy and maybe the breakup was inevitable. But the method was inappropriate.\n\nLegally, there might not be a violation, but morally, it's a gray area. The author's action caused immediate harm (emotional pain) even if it led to a long-term benefit. The question is whether the means justified the ends. Since the author didn't ask for consent and acted on their own, it's likely they're in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But maybe others might argue it's not wrong because they helped. Need to consider both sides, but ultimately, interfering without permission is a breach of trust and respect.\n"
