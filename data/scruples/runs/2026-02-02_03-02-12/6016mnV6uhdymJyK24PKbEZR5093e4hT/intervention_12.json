My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is part of a debate team and is running for co-captains with their partner, Tim. They see another couple, James and Mary, as their main competition. The author learned that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because of the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to eliminate competition by breaking up James and Mary's partnership. However, they justified it by saying it was for the couples' good because they were unhappy. \n\nBut there's a problem here. The author used the information they had to interfere in a personal relationship, possibly for their own benefit. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author had no right to act as a mediator or informer without consent. Relationships are personal, and even if there's a belief that the couple is incompatible, it's not someone else's place to cause a breakup unless they were consulted or involved. \n\nAdditionally, the author might have breached confidentiality. They heard the partners' thoughts in confidence and then revealed them, which is a violation of trust. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the method was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the couple's partnership was affecting the debate team's dynamics, and the author was trying to prevent a forced partnership. But that's a stretch. The author's role isn't to mediate personal relationships unless they were asked. \n\nSo, the key points are: unauthorized interference in a relationship, breach of confidentiality, and self-serving motives. Those typically point towards the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
