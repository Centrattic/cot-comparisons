My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did the wrong thing by telling Tim and his partner their thoughts about each other. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author knows that James and Mary come from different social groups, and they're in a relationship despite not being happy. Mary thinks James is a \"big mouth, small brain,\" and James thinks Mary is too idealistic and boring. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention was to help James and Mary by ending their unhappy relationship, which might have been affecting their debate partnership. The outcome was that they broke up, which upset James, but others thought the author was doing the right thing.\n\nNow, considering the ethics of the situation. Telling someone what someone else thinks about them can be a gray area. If the author had no direct evidence and just speculated, that's different. But in this case, the author mentions that they had casual conversations where they learned these thoughts. So the information isn't entirely made up. However, the author is an intermediary here, passing along negative thoughts from one to the other. \n\nThere's also the issue of consent. James and Mary didn't ask the author for their partner's thoughts, and the author didn't get permission to relay this information. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent can be problematic. It's like gossiping or spreading information that could hurt people, even if the intention is good.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. The breakup happened during a debate meeting, which affected the team's environment. James was crying, so there's emotional harm involved. While others might agree it was a favor, the method of delivery (public breakup) could have been harsh. The author didn't approach them privately to discuss this, which might have been a more considerate way.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation. They might have been trying to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. However, the author claims the main reason was to help James and Mary. Still, it's possible there's an ulterior motive here. If the author is trying to undermine their competition, even if the action helped the team, the intent might be questionable.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, actions are judged based on their consequences and intent. Even with good intentions, the act of revealing personal thoughts without permission can be seen as violating trust. The author put James and Mary in a difficult position, causing public embarrassment and emotional distress. \n\nHowever, some might argue that ending an unhappy relationship is beneficial, and the author's role in facilitating that is positive. But the method\u2014without consent and in a public setting\u2014is where the problem lies. It's a balance between honesty and respect for others' privacy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal, potentially sensitive information without consent, leading to public conflict and emotional harm. Even if the outcome was better for the team, the means were not respectful.\n"
