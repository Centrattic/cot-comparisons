My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. They're on the debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in the relationship but stay together because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to an argument and breakup.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author did the right thing. The answer options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author acted as a mediator or someone who thought they were helping by revealing mutual criticisms. The couple was staying together for strategic reasons (debate partnership) but were unhappy. The author's intention was to free them from an unhappy relationship, even if it caused immediate conflict. The other team members supported the author's action.\n\nSo, from a deontological ethics perspective, is it wrong to tell someone what another person thinks about them, even if it's true and with good intentions? Maybe. It could be seen as a violation of trust or privacy. The author didn't ask for consent to share those thoughts. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author took it upon themselves to expose the negative opinions, which could have been handled differently, like encouraging them to communicate.\n\nConsequentialism-wise, the outcome was that the couple broke up and James was upset. But the author's side argues that it did them a favor by ending an unhappy relationship. However, the means of using someone else's private thoughts without permission could be problematic. The author might have overstepped by not letting the couple resolve their issues themselves.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation was to eliminate competition, which adds a layer of self-interest. Even if they believed in their cause, the method could be seen as underhanded. The fact that James blamed the author suggests that the action had a negative impact on him, which could weigh against the author's justification.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was in a toxic relationship for strategic reasons, helping them break up could be seen as a positive act. The community's approval also plays a role in their moral assessment. But the key issue is whether the author had the right to act as a go-between without the couple's consent. Even if the outcome is good, the method might still be ethically questionable.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a line, even if the intention was good. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for meddling in the relationship without permission and causing direct harm.\n"
