TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the guy broke up with her, she moved on by dating others, and then found out he was testing her. Now he's angry she slept with others.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy called it off, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to accept it. Then she used Tinder and slept with others. The guy later admitted it was a test to see her reaction, got angry, and blocked her.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. The main issue is consent and the nature of their relationship. If the breakup was mutual or clear, then she's free to date others. But if the guy was still in a relationship and testing her, that's a problem. However, from her perspective, she thought it was a breakup. She had no reason to believe he wasn't done until later. \n\nCheating typically involves an existing relationship. If they were not in a relationship anymore, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. The guy's test adds a layer of deception. He was still in love but pretended to break up. His actions were manipulative. So the author acted based on the information she had. She can't be blamed for trusting that he was done. \n\nAlso, the guy's anger seems hypocritical. He manipulated the situation, and now she's punished for acting on his supposed \"breakup.\" The fact that he used a test to see her behavior shows he was emotionally unstable. His reaction is more about his own unresolved feelings than her actions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted in good faith. The guy's deception is the root problem. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
