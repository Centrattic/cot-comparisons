TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details again.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship with a guy. He told her they should just be friends, which she took as a breakup. She was heartbroken but eventually started talking to him as friends. Then, to boost her self-esteem, she started dating others via Tinder and had sex with a few people. She thought it was okay because they weren't dating anymore. But now she found out that his \"breakup\" was actually a test to see her reaction, and he's angry she slept with others. He blocked her and won't talk.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the communication and mutual understanding of the relationship status. The guy said they should be friends, which the author interpreted as a breakup. She then moved on, which she thought was acceptable. However, the guy was using the breakup as a test to see if she would stay faithful, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she followed his lead. If he had been clear that he wasn't ending the relationship but just testing her loyalty, she might not have proceeded. But since he never clarified that he was still considering them a couple, she acted based on the information she had. Infidelity typically requires a mutual commitment to be in a monogamous relationship. If they were no longer in a relationship, then technically, she wasn't being unfaithful. \n\nOn the other hand, if there was an implicit understanding that they were still an item, even if he said they should be friends, then she might be at fault. But the problem is that he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. Using a breakup as a test is a red flag. The author acted on the assumption that the relationship was over, which many people would take as a definitive end. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed his lead and acted based on his stated intentions. The guy's actions were deceptive, and she couldn't be expected to know it was a test unless he communicated that upfront.\n"
