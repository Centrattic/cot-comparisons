TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship with a guy who ended things by saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and slept with others. Later, the guy reveals the breakup was a test to see what she'd do. He's now angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the breakup. If the guy said it's over and they should be friends, then technically they're not in a relationship anymore. So the author is no longer in a committed relationship and isn't obligated to be faithful. That would suggest she's not in the wrong for moving on.\n\nBut the twist is that the breakup was a test. The guy didn't actually want to break up but wanted to see her reaction. That's a bit deceptive. However, the author made her decisions based on the information she had at the time. She believed the breakup was real. So, acting on that belief, sleeping with others when they weren't officially together might not be her fault.\n\nBut some might argue that maybe the breakup being a test means the relationship was still ongoing, even if not explicitly stated. However, the guy didn't clarify that. He just said they should be friends. The author can't be expected to read his mind. \n\nAnother angle: the guy's actions were manipulative. Using a fake breakup to test loyalty is a red flag. The author wasn't in the wrong for trying to heal and move on after a breakup, even if it was a test. She had no way of knowing it wasn't real. \n\nSo in terms of responsibility, the guy's deception is the main issue here. The author acted based on the information she had. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
