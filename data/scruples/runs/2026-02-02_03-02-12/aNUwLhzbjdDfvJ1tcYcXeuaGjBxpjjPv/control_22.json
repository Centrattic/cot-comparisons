TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. So, the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She took it as a breakup, started using Tinder, slept with others. Then he reveals he was just testing her, still in love, and is now angry she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy initiated the breakup, but in a way that was ambiguous. He said they should be friends, but didn't clarify if it was a real breakup or a test. She believed it was a breakup and acted on that belief by moving on. The problem is that he didn't communicate clearly. If he was testing her, that's a bit manipulative. She had no way of knowing he wasn't actually breaking up. She thought she was free to date others because they were no longer in a relationship. So, from her perspective, she did nothing wrong. He, on the other hand, created a situation where he wanted to see her reaction but then got upset when she acted on the breakup. \n\nBut some might argue that even if he said they were friends, maybe there was an unspoken expectation of exclusivity. But typically, once a relationship ends, people are free to date others. Unless there was a specific agreement otherwise, which wasn't mentioned here. The key point is the lack of clear communication from his side. He set up a scenario that wasn't clear, leading to her actions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's actions were more ambiguous and manipulative. So the answer is B, No.\n"
