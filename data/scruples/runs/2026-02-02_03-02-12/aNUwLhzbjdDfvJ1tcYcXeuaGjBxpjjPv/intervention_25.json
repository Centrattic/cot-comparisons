TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship where she was deeply in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate the same feelings. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on. To boost her self-esteem, she got on Tinder and slept with others. The guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy claimed to have broken up, so from the author's perspective, they were no longer in a relationship. If that's the case, then the author didn't have an obligation to be faithful. But the twist here is that the guy's breakup was a test. That's a bit manipulative, right? If someone says they're breaking up but it's actually a test, that's deceptive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is consent and clear communication. If the guy genuinely ended the relationship, the author was within her rights to date others. However, if he didn't actually end the relationship and was just testing her, then maybe there was some ambiguity. But from the author's point of view, she believed they were no longer in a relationship. His test was a lie, which complicates things.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If one person uses a breakup as a test, that's a red flag. The author acted based on the information she had at the time, which was that they were over. The guy's anger stems from his own manipulative behavior. Therefore, the fault might lie with him for not being honest and for using a test that wasn't ethical.\n\nBut some might argue that even if the breakup was a test, the author could have handled it differently. However, the key point is that the author was acting under the belief that the relationship was over. The guy's actions were deceptive, so the blame isn't on the author. She wasn't cheating because they weren't in a relationship. His test was a personal choice that backfired.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
