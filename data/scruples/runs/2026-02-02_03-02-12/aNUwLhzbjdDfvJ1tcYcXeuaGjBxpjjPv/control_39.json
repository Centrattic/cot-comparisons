TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, then the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She started dating others and sleeping with people on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. Now the guy is angry and says the breakup was just a test to see what she would do.\n\nHmm. So first, the guy broke up with her. That's a clear end of the relationship, right? The author thought it was over, so she moved on. But the guy later claims it was a test. Now, the key here is whether the breakup was genuine or not. If the guy never actually ended the relationship and just said he wanted to be friends as a test, then maybe the author was wrong. But how can you test a breakup? That's a bit of a paradox. Usually, a breakup is an end, and the person who wants to test it might not have the right to do so. \n\nThe author's perspective is that after the breakup, they were just friends, so she had no obligation to stay faithful. That makes sense because once a relationship is over, there are no commitments. However, the guy's friend says he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. If the breakup was a test, then maybe the author did something wrong by sleeping with others during the test. But here's the catch: the author had no way of knowing it was a test. The guy didn't indicate that. He told her it was a breakup, and she acted accordingly. \n\nSo, if the guy was lying about the breakup being final, then he's the one being manipulative. The author made a mistake in judgment by sleeping with others while heartbroken, but if the breakup was genuine, she's not at fault. However, if the guy never intended to end the relationship, then the author's actions could be seen as wrong. But the problem is that the guy didn't own up to the test until after the fact. The author couldn't have known. \n\nIn most situations, once someone says they want to break up, even if it's a test, the other person is within their rights to move on. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he didn't clearly communicate his intentions. The author's actions were based on the information she had at the time. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The guy's test was manipulative, and she acted appropriately given the breakup he initiated.\n"
