TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then used Tinder and slept with others, thinking the relationship was over. The guy later revealed the breakup was a test, and he's upset because she was with others during that time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy initiated the breakup, so from the author's perspective, the relationship ended. She felt it was over, so she moved on by dating others. But he later says it wasn't really a breakup, just a test to see her reaction. Now he's angry because she slept with others while he thought the relationship was still on hold.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after a breakup that she believed was real. In most ethical and relationship standards, once a breakup happens, especially if it's mutual or one-sided (like in this case where he said to be friends), the person is no longer bound by the previous relationship's rules. So if the breakup was legitimate, her actions are her own, and she's not obligated to stay faithful.\n\nBut there's a twist here: the guy's breakup was a test. That's manipulative. He didn't communicate his intentions clearly and led her to believe the relationship was over. By doing so, he's at fault for not being honest. However, the question is about the author's actions. She acted based on the information she had. Since she believed they were broken up, sleeping with others isn't her fault. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being honest from the start.\n\nAnother angle: emotional cheating. But in this case, there's no indication of emotional cheating; she's just physically intimate with others after the breakup. If the breakup was real, that's not cheating. The problem arises because the guy didn't actually want to end the relationship, but he didn't communicate that. So the author isn't in the wrong for moving on when she thought the relationship was over.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have known there was a possibility he was testing her. But that's a stretch. People can't read minds. The onus is on the person initiating the breakup to be clear about their intentions. If he wanted to test her, he should have done so without leading her to believe the relationship was ending. The author's actions were based on his stated intention to be friends.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions were misleading and manipulative, and she had every right to move on after a breakup he initiated.\n"
