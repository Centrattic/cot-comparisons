TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-boyfriend broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost her self-esteem, thinking they were no longer a couple. Later, she found out that the breakup was actually a test by him to see how she would react. He's now angry because she slept with others while they weren't in a relationship. The author thinks she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the communication between the two people and the expectations each had. When a breakup happens, especially a mutual one, there's an expectation that the relationship is over. The man initially said he wanted to be friends, which led the woman to believe it was a real breakup. She then moved on by dating others, which seems like a natural response after a breakup. However, the twist is that he later revealed it was a test, which complicates things.\n\nBut wait, if the man had not clearly communicated his intentions to test her, then the responsibility lies with him. The woman acted based on the information she had at the time. If he didn't clarify that the breakup was hypothetical, then she wasn't in the wrong for taking it as a real end to the relationship. Cheating in a relationship requires a committed partnership, but once that is dissolved, the obligation to remain faithful is gone. Since they were not in a relationship anymore, her actions aren't cheating. The man's anger stems from his own unclear communication and hidden motives. He should have been honest about his intentions if he wanted to test her, which is more about his lack of trust or maturity.\n\nAnother angle is that the man's test was manipulative. Using a breakup as a test to see if the other person is faithful is unethical. The author had every right to move on after he ended things. So, she's not in the wrong because she acted on the breakup being real, and he misrepresented his intentions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
