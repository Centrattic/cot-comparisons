TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario, so I remember that's about a breakup and then getting back together. The user is asking if they did the right thing by sleeping with other people after a breakup, which the ex then found out about and was upset, especially since the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline and the communication between the two. The guy said they were breaking up, so the author thought it was over. They moved on, used Tinder, and slept with others. The author's reasoning was that since they were no longer in a relationship, there was no obligation to be faithful. That makes sense because once a relationship is over, each person is free to date others.\n\nBut then the twist is that the guy's breakup was a test. He was still in love and wanted to see how the author would react. Now he's angry because she didn't wait or stay faithful during his test. The question is whether the author was wrong in her actions.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she was in a committed relationship, even if it wasn't reciprocated as strongly as she wanted. When he broke up with her, she had no reason to believe it was a test. She was heartbroken and tried to move on. Sleeping with others after a breakup is a common way people try to deal with their feelings, even if it doesn't work. She didn't know it was a test, so she acted based on the information she had.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's actions might be seen as manipulative. Setting up a test without clear communication can be problematic. If he was in love and wanted to test her loyalty, he should have been honest about his intentions. However, the author isn't in the wrong for acting on the assumption that the relationship was over. She didn't have any indication it wasn't the real breakup. \n\nIn relationships, once a breakup is declared, unless there's a clear understanding of a trial period, the other person has the right to move on. The author's mistake might have been not discussing the status of their relationship after the breakup, but the blame lies more on the guy for not being honest from the start. The author acted based on the breakup he initiated, so she isn't in the wrong.\n"
