TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross ends the relationship, Rachel starts dating someone else, and then Ross comes back. \n\nFirst, the guy broke up with the author, stating they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and needing to rebuild self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. The key point here is whether the breakup was legitimate. The author believed it was a breakup, so they didn't think they were cheating.\n\nThen, it turns out the guy's breakup was actually a test to see if the author would stay loyal. He was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. When she moved on, he got angry and blocked her. \n\nSo, the main issue is the guy's dishonesty. If he genuinely broke up, the author wasn't in the wrong to move on. But since he fabricated the breakup as a test, he's the one who manipulated the situation. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. She didn't know it was a test, so she couldn't have known her actions would be considered wrong by him. Therefore, the fault lies with the guy for not being honest. The author isn't at fault because she made the best of a tough situation based on what she was told.\n"
