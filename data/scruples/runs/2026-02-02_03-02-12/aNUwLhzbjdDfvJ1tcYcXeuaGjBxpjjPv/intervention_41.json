TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, then the author sleeping with others, and then the ex getting upset later because the breakup was a test. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The guy said he wanted to be just friends, so the author assumed it was a breakup. In that case, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating, right? Because they were no longer in a relationship. But wait, the twist is that the guy later admitted breaking up was a test. That complicates things. \n\nSo, if the guy was still in love and using a breakup as a test, then technically he might have been in the relationship still, even though he said they should be friends. But the author had no way of knowing that. The ex was adamant about being friends, leading the author to believe the relationship was over. \n\nThe key here is consent and communication. If the breakup was real, then the author is not in the wrong. But if the breakup was a test, maybe the guy expected some loyalty. But how can you hold someone to a test they didn't agree to? The author had no clue it was a test. \n\nAlso, the author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. Sleeping with others isn't cheating if you're not in a relationship. The fact that the ex got angry after blocking her suggests he's being hypocritical. He wanted to see her reaction but got upset when she moved on. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had at the time. The ex's actions (breaking up, then making it a test) are the real issue here. He didn't communicate properly and then held her actions against her. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
