TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's partner broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then started dating others on Tinder to help their self-esteem. Later, they found out the breakup was a test, and the partner was still in love. Now the partner is angry because the author slept with others while they weren't in a relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the breakup was declared by the partner, the author assumed it was over, and acted accordingly. The partner, however, had ulterior motives, using a breakup as a test. The author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over.\n\nIn terms of fidelity, if the relationship was officially ended, then the author isn't obligated to remain faithful. The confusion arises because the partner didn't communicate their true intentions. The author acted on the information given. The partner's anger might stem from their own hidden agenda rather than the author's actions being wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the breakup as communicated. The issue here is more about the partner's manipulation and lack of clear communication. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
