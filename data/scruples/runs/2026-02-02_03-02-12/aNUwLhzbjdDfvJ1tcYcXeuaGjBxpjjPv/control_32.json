TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to move on, used Tinder and had sex with others. The key point is that they were no longer in a relationship, so the author didn't see it as cheating.\n\nBut then it turns out the guy's breakup was a test. He wanted to see how she'd react, and he's angry she moved on. Now he's blocked her. \n\nThe main question is about consent and the nature of the breakup. If he didn't clearly communicate his intentions, can he hold her accountable for moving on? In a real breakup, the expectations are that each person can date others. If he didn't make it official, maybe he's at fault for misleading her. But the author might be in the wrong if she made assumptions without clear communication. However, given that he said they were just friends and she wasn't in a relationship anymore, her actions could be justified. The guy's test is manipulative, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author acted based on the information she had. The guy's test was deceptive, so he's the one in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to wait if the relationship was genuinely over.\n"
