TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, the author moved on by sleeping with others, and then found out the breakup was a test. The guy is now angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author thought they were broken up, so they used Tinder and slept with others. The guy later admitted he broke up as a test and is upset about the author's actions.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were in a breakup and tried to move on. They didn't know it was a test, so their actions were based on the assumption they weren't in a relationship anymore. The guy's behavior here is a bit tricky because he didn't communicate clearly. By breaking up and then expecting fidelity as a test, he might have set up an unfair situation.\n\nBut, in relationships, trust and communication are key. If the guy had been clear that he was testing or that he still wanted a relationship, maybe things could have been different. However, since the author believed they were single and acted accordingly, they might not be at fault. The guy's actions\u2014using a breakup as a test and then getting angry\u2014could indicate he's being manipulative or inconsistent.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have stayed in the relationship if they were still in love. But the guy was the one who initiated the breakup, so the author had every right to move on. The problem here is the guy's lack of clear communication and his subsequent anger over something that was based on a false premise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had at the time. The guy's test was dishonest and led to a misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
