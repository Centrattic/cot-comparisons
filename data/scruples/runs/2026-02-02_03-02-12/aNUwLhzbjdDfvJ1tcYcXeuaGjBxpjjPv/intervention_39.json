TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy \"broke up\" with her, and she then slept with others, thinking they were no longer a couple. But later he told her his break-up was a test to see how she'd react, and now he's angry she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The guy said they should be friends, which led her to believe the relationship was over. She started dating others as a way to heal and rebuild her self-esteem. The problem arises when he reveals his break-up was a test, and he's upset about her actions.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, after a breakup, engaging in new relationships is a personal choice. If the guy didn't make his intentions clear, she had no reason to stay in a limbo state. However, the twist here is that he considered the breakup a test, which is a bit manipulative because he never clarified that he was still in love and just wanted to see her response. That ambiguity complicates things.\n\nLegally and ethically, once a relationship is considered over (especially if the partner said it's just friends), the other person is free to date others. However, the situation becomes tricky because the guy's actions were deceptive. He didn't communicate his true feelings and instead used a breakup as a test, which is not a healthy approach. The author acted based on what she was told, so she's not at fault here.\n\nBut there's another angle: maybe the guy didn't actually end the relationship, and his \"breakup\" was a way to push her to commit or test her loyalty. If that's the case, then the author might have misunderstood the status of the relationship. However, since he didn't clarify his intentions and instead left it ambiguous, it's hard to hold her responsible.\n\nIn terms of emotional responsibility, the author did what she thought was necessary to move on. The guy's anger stems from his own lack of clear communication. So, the blame here seems to lie more with the guy for not being honest about his feelings and for using a breakup as a test. The author, acting on the information given, isn't in the wrong.\n"
