TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost their self-esteem, thinking the relationship was over. Later, they found out the breakup was a test, and the partner was still in love and got angry about the author's actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The partner initiated the breakup, said they wanted to be friends, and the author took them at their word. The author's actions (sleeping with others) happened after they believed the relationship had ended. However, the partner later revealed that the breakup was a test to see the author's reaction. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relational ethics perspective, if the partner had not actually ended the relationship and was still committed, then the author might have been unfaithful. But the problem is that the partner's intentions were deceptive. The partner claimed it was a breakup, so the author had no reason to suspect otherwise. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, infidelity is considered wrong if there's a mutual understanding of the relationship status. However, in this case, the author believed the relationship was over. The deception from the partner complicates things. The partner's actions (pretending to break up as a test) could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship had ended, so they sought to rebuild their self-esteem. While the author might not have been wrong in taking steps to move on, the partner's deception is problematic. However, some might argue that the author should have maintained communication to clarify the situation, especially since the partner was still in their life as a friend. \n\nBut in relationships, trust is key. If one partner is intentionally ambiguous or deceptive about their intentions, the other's actions based on that ambiguity might be harder to judge as wrong. The partner's test and subsequent anger could be seen as unfair, especially since they didn't clarify their true feelings before the breakup. \n\nIn conclusion, the author was acting based on the information given. The partner's deception and lack of clarity about the relationship status make it a situational ethics issue. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted in good faith based on the partner's stated intentions. The partner's actions are more questionable due to the test and lack of transparency. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
