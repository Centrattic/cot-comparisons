TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted on Reddit) is in the wrong after sleeping with new people following what they believed was a breakup. The key points here are the circumstances of the breakup and the intentions of the guy involved.\n\nFirst, the author's partner ended the relationship, stating they wanted to be just friends. The author, hurt and trying to rebuild self-esteem, used Tinder and engaged in sexual relationships with others. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship and thus not obligated to remain faithful. However, the partner later revealed that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, which ended the communication and led to blocking.\n\nNow, considering standard societal norms and relationship ethics, if someone has officially ended a relationship and the other person is no longer in a committed state, engaging in new relationships or sexual activity isn't inherently wrong. The partner's action of calling it off and then later claiming it was a test complicates things. The partner might be at fault for not being clear about their intentions from the start. The author acted based on the information they had at the time, which was that the relationship was over. The partner's subsequent anger might stem from their own dishonesty and lack of communication. So, the author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was terminated, making them not in the wrong. The responsibility here could lie more with the partner who manipulated the situation.\n"
