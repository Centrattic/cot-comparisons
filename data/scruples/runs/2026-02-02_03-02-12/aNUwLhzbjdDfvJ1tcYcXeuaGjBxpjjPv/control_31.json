TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author thought their boyfriend had broken up with them for good, so they started seeing other people. But the boyfriend had actually broken up as a test to see if the author would stay loyal. Now he's angry and won't talk to her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship. The boyfriend said they should be friends, and the author accepted that. The author then decided to boost their self-esteem by dating others, which they thought was okay since they were not a couple anymore. The boyfriend later reveals the breakup was a test, and he's upset she moved on.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. From the author's perspective, they had no reason to believe the breakup was temporary. Relationships can end for various reasons, and people usually assume a breakup is final unless told otherwise. The author made the best of the situation to recover their self-esteem, which is a common reaction after a breakup.\n\nThe boyfriend's action of using a breakup as a test is quite manipulative. It's unusual for someone to end a relationship just to check their partner's loyalty. That seems selfish and controlling. The author can't be held responsible for acting on their understanding of the situation, especially since the boyfriend didn't clarify that it was a test. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have been more cautious. But given that the boyfriend was insistent about being friends and the author took that at face value, it's hard to blame them. The real issue here is the boyfriend's dishonesty and manipulation. The author isn't in the wrong here because they acted based on the information they had at the time. The boyfriend's reaction seems unfair since he set up the situation deceptively.\n"
