TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was in a relationship with a guy who didn't express strong feelings but hinted at them. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually accepted it. To boost her self-esteem, she started using Tinder and had sex with others. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. Then she accidentally told him, and he got angry, blocking her. Later, she found out that his breakup was a test\u2014he wanted to see if she'd stay faithful and is now furious.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the breakup and whether it was mutual or not. The guy claimed it was better to be friends, but then later said it was a test. If the breakup wasn't mutual and he didn't really intend to end the relationship, maybe the author didn't know. But he did say it was a breakup, so she thought they were no longer a couple. \n\nIn most relationships, once a breakup is declared\u2014even if it's a test\u2014the person who's been dumped is free to move on. But the guy's actions were deceptive. He used the breakup as a test, which is manipulative. The author's actions were based on the assumption that they were over. So, she didn't know he was still in love and using the breakup as a test. She had the right to seek emotional healing, even if it meant moving on with others. However, maybe she should have considered his feelings, but since he didn't communicate his true intentions, it's not entirely her fault. \n\nThe guy's anger might stem from his own manipulative behavior. If he wanted to test her, he shouldn't have made her go through the emotional pain of a breakup. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information given to her. The real issue is his deceit. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
