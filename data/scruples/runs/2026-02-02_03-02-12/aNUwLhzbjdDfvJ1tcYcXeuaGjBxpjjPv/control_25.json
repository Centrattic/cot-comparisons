TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup, which turned out to be a test by the ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy broke up with the author, claiming they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. She thought the relationship was over. Then, the guy reveals the breakup was a test to see her reaction, and he's angry she slept with others, blocking her.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1. The guy said it was a breakup. 2. The author acted accordingly, moving on. 3. The guy later says it wasn't a real breakup but a test. 4. The author is being blamed for sleeping with others after the \"breakup.\"\n\nNow, the question is, is she in the wrong? Let's think about consent and communication. If the guy said it was a breakup, then the author had every right to move on. The problem here seems to be that the guy didn't communicate clearly. He broke up with her, leading her to believe the relationship was over. She acted based on that. His claim that it was a test is a bit manipulative because he didn't clarify from the start that he was testing her loyalty. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more nuance. Did the guy give any hints that it wasn't a real breakup? The author mentions he never said he felt as strongly as she did but hinted sometimes. That ambiguity might have contributed to her confusion. However, once he decided to break up and said being friends was better, she had no reason to believe otherwise. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's test was unethical and manipulative. He can't hold her accountable for something he didn't clearly communicate. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, especially if both parties agreed it was over. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
