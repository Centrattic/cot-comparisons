TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after what they thought was a breakup. The key here is the ambiguity of the breakup. The guy said it was better to be friends, but later admitted it was a test. \n\nFirst, the author believed they were no longer in a relationship. If someone ends a relationship and says they want to be friends, the natural assumption is that the relationship is over. The author acted on that assumption by moving on, which is a common way people deal with breakups.\n\nHowever, the guy later revealed his breakup was a test. That's tricky because it's deceptive. If he didn't actually want to break up but was testing the author's reactions, that's his fault for not being clear. But the author had no way of knowing that at the time. They made decisions based on the information they had.\n\nThe ethical question is whether the author is responsible for his deception. Since he manipulated the situation, the blame might lie more with him. The author isn't cheating because they thought the relationship was over. Moving on emotionally by seeing others isn't inherently wrong in that context. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have verified the breakup. However, it's unrealistic to expect someone to keep their options open indefinitely or to question every breakup. The guy's actions were deceitful, so the fault isn't on the author. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup they were told about, not knowing it was a test. The responsibility for the deception lies with the ex.\n"
