TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given scenario. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel storyline, where the guy breaks up, the girl moves on, and then the guy realizes he still has feelings.\n\nFirst, the guy ended the relationship, saying they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts using Tinder and sleeps with others. She thought they weren't in a relationship anymore, so she felt it was okay. But later, she finds out the break-up was a test, and now he's angry because he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here: The guy claimed to break up, but it was a test. The author acted on her emotions and moved on, which he didn't expect. Now he's upset because she \"cheated\" during a test. But wait, if they were no longer in a relationship, then technically she wasn't cheating. However, the guy's actions were deceptive. He pretended to break up to test her loyalty. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. Legally or ethically, if the relationship was over, sleeping with others isn't cheating. But emotionally, the guy expected her to stay faithful even though he ended the relationship. That's a bit of a contradiction. The author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. The guy, on the other hand, was using a fake break-up to test her. So, the fault here might lie with the guy for being manipulative.\n\nBut the author did sleep with others while he was still in love with her, which might have been a betrayal of trust even if they weren't officially a couple. However, the guy's initial actions set the stage for confusion. If he had truly wanted to be friends, he wouldn't have tested her like that. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be in the wrong because she acted based on the information given. The guy's deception complicates things. However, the author could have handled her emotions differently, maybe seeking closure before moving on. But the main issue is the guy's manipulative behavior. So the answer is more likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the guy's actions were deceptive.\n"
