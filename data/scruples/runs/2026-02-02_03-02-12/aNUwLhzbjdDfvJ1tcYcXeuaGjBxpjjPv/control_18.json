TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-boyfriend ended their relationship, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then started dating others on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. However, the ex later claims the breakup was a test to see how the author would react, and now he's angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, the key point is whether the author was in a committed relationship when she started seeing others. The ex said they were just friends, so there's no current relationship. Legally and socially, once a relationship is over, dating others isn't cheating. The ex's claim that it was a test is problematic because he didn't clarify his intentions. He ended the relationship and then later changed his mind, which is a common issue in breakups.\n\nThe author acted based on the information she had at the time. She believed the relationship was over. Even if the ex thought it was a test, he never communicated that clearly. The fault here might lie more with the ex for being manipulative by making her think it was a breakup and then testing her. However, the author did move on, which is understandable after a breakup, especially to regain self-esteem.\n\nThe ethical question is whether the author was wrong. Since the ex didn't make his intentions clear and the breakup was already declared, the author's actions were based on the assumption that they were no longer a couple. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The ex's anger stems from his own unclear communication and manipulative behavior. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
