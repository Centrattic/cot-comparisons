TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy never reciprocated the same feelings. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually accepted it. To boost her self-esteem, she started using Tinder and had sex with others. She thought it was okay since they were no longer a couple. However, the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see how she'd react. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. The key points to consider are: the nature of their relationship, communication, and mutual understanding.\n\nFirst, the guy initiated the breakup, claiming they should be friends. Even if it was a test, he didn't clarify that. The author believed they were over, so acting on that belief by moving on doesn't inherently make her wrong. Infidelity usually applies when there's an active relationship. If they were no longer a couple, sleeping with others isn't cheating. \n\nHowever, there's a communication problem. The author might have thought they were over, but the guy's intentions were deceptive. The author's actions were based on the assumption that the breakup was real. Without any indication that the breakup wasn't final, her actions are understandable. \n\nThe guy's test seems manipulative. He didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions. If he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty, that's a red flag. The author didn't know about the test, so holding her responsible for his reaction might be unfair. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation was to rebuild her self-esteem after the breakup. While sleeping with others might not resolve her feelings, her intention wasn't malicious. \n\nOn the other hand, if the guy believed he had the right to test her, maybe he expected her to stay celibate as a test of loyalty. But in reality, once a breakup is mutual and confirmed, each person is free to date. The guy's anger stems from his own manipulative behavior rather than the author's actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted based on the breakup being real. The guy's test was deceptive, and his anger is misplaced. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
