TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was in a relationship with a guy who broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She got used to it, started using Tinder, and slept with a few people. Now he's saying the breakup was a test, and he's angry because she slept with others during that time. The question is, is she in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy said they were breaking up and wanted to be friends. The author believed that the relationship was over, so she moved on by dating others. But it turns out that the guy didn't actually want to break up; he was testing her reaction. Now he's upset because she \"cheated\" during his fake breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the authenticity of the breakup, the author's actions based on that breakup, and the guy's intentions. If the guy's breakup was a lie and he never intended to end the relationship, then technically they were still in a relationship when she started seeing others. That would mean she was unfaithful, which would make her at fault. However, she believed the breakup was real and acted accordingly. \n\nBut intentions matter. If the guy misrepresented the status of the relationship, he's partially at fault for the confusion. However, the author may be in the wrong because she engaged in relationships with others after the breakup, assuming it was over. If the breakup wasn't real, then she was cheating. The problem is whether the breakup was genuine. The guy said he wanted to be just friends, so from her perspective, it was over. But his friend says it was a test, implying he never ended the relationship. So there's ambiguity here.\n\nIn relationships, the person who initiates the breakup is responsible for clarifying the terms. If he said it was a breakup, then she had a right to believe that. But if he lied about the breakup being real, he's the one who's deceptive. However, the author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. So, depending on the interpretation, she might not be in the wrong because she acted on the given information. But if the relationship wasn't actually over, then yes, she was cheating. \n\nBut since the guy made the breakup public and said they should be friends, the author had no reason to suspect otherwise. His friend's information complicates things, but if the guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test, then the author isn't to blame. However, in relationships, once a breakup is declared, the other person should be honest. If the guy was still in love and wanted to test her, but didn't communicate that, he's at fault. The author's actions were based on the broken communication. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author was in a committed relationship when she started seeing others. If the breakup was real, then she's not in the wrong. If it was fake, then she is. The problem is the ambiguity. Since the guy said it was a breakup and acted on it, the author can't be blamed for moving on. The guy's deceptiveness is the main issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the breakup was presented as real. So the answer would be B, No."
