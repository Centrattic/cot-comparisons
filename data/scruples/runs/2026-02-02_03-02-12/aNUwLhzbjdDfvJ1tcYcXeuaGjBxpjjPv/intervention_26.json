TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with other people after a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate as strongly. He broke up, saying they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others to boost self-esteem. The guy later revealed the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay loyal. He's now angry and blocked her.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. When the breakup happened, the guy said they should be friends. The author, assuming it was over, moved on. But the guy's \"test\" was a manipulation tactic. He didn't communicate his intentions clearly. The author had no reason to believe the breakup wasn't real. She acted based on the information given. Cheating usually involves betraying a partner in a committed relationship. Since the author believed the relationship was over, her actions post-breakup aren't cheating. The guy's deception is the main issue here. He set up a scenario where he could punish her for acting on his false breakup. That's manipulative. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were based on the breakup being real, which was the information she had at the time.\n"
