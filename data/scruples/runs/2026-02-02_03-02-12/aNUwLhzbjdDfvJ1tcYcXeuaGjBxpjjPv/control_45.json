TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to Ross and Rachel, which is a well-known example where Ross breaks up with Rachel, and then later claims it was a mistake. \n\nSo the author was in a relationship, the guy said he wanted to be friends, and she thought it was a breakup. She then started dating others on Tinder. But he was actually using her as a test to see how she'd react, and now he's mad she moved on. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. Legally, if they were never married or in a civil partnership, there's no obligation. But emotionally and ethically, it's more complicated. The key point is whether the breakup was genuine or not. The guy said it was a test, but the author reasonably assumed it was a breakup. If he didn't communicate clearly that it wasn't a breakup, then the author had no way of knowing. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate their intentions. If the guy was still in love and wanted to test her, but didn't make his intentions clear, then the author isn't at fault for moving on. She took his word that they were just friends and acted accordingly. However, sleeping with others immediately after a breakup might be seen as a personal choice, but if the relationship was still ongoing in some form, even if not officially, then maybe there's room for criticism. \n\nBut in this case, the guy's actions are deceptive. He broke up with her to test her, which is a red flag. The author can't be blamed for trusting his words. So the fault lies with the guy for not being honest from the start. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
