TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author was in a relationship with a guy who told them he wanted to be friends instead. They were heartbroken but eventually started talking as friends. Then, the author started using Tinder and slept with other people to boost their self-esteem, thinking the relationship was over. The guy later admitted that the breakup was a test to see what the author would do, and he's now angry because she slept with others even though they weren't officially together anymore. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, the guy called it off, saying they should be friends. The author believed the relationship was over and moved on by dating others. But the guy actually didn't end the relationship; he was testing her loyalty. The author didn't know that at the time. So, from the author's perspective, she thought she was free to date. But from the guy's side, he felt that by ending the relationship, he could test her actions. \n\nWait, but if he didn't actually end the relationship, then maybe there wasn't a breakup. The line says \"he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends.\" But if he was still in love and wanted to test her, then technically, maybe the breakup wasn't real. But the author believed it was a breakup and acted on that belief. \n\nSo the key points here are communication and consent. If the guy didn't actually end the relationship but pretended to, then the author was acting on his words, which she believed were a breakup. But if there was no actual mutual agreement to end the relationship, then maybe she was still in a relationship and sleeping with others would be cheating. \n\nBut here's the thing: if he told her to be friends and she believed that to be the case, then she might have thought it was okay. However, if he didn't really end things and was using that as a test, then she was wrong to assume it was over. But how could she know? The problem is that the guy's intentions were unclear. He didn't communicate that the breakup was a test until later. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate their expectations clearly. If he didn't explicitly state that the breakup wasn't real, then the author had a right to believe it was over. But if he was still in the relationship and using the breakup as a test, then sleeping with others would be cheating. \n\nHowever, since he didn't clarify until after the fact, it's a matter of who had the responsibility to communicate. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. The guy's actions were deceptive. But the author might be in the wrong if there wasn't a real breakup. \n\nWait, but if he thought they could only be friends, but he was still in the relationship, then maybe it was a mutual break-up with the intention to be friends. If that's the case, then the author's actions are legitimate. But if he didn't end the relationship and was just testing her, then she was still in a relationship. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The author's mistake was assuming the breakup was real. The guy's mistake was not being clear and using a fake breakup as a test. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on his initial declaration. The guy's behavior is deceptive. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
