TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person who wrote this is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with others after a breakup, which they believed was real. The guy ended up using a fake breakup as a test.\n\nFirst, the author thought they were broken up. If that's the case, then they're not in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But the guy didn't actually break up with them; he just pretended to. So technically, they were still in a relationship, but the author didn't know that.\n\nBut here's the tricky part: if the guy lied about the breakup, then he's the one who's being deceptive. The author acted on what they believed was the truth. However, the guy argues that since he never actually ended things, it's still a relationship. But if he kept talking to the author after \"breaking up,\" maybe he was leading them on. The author might not have known the breakup was a test.\n\nThe author's actions were based on their belief that they were single. Since the guy didn't clarify that the breakup was fake, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The responsibility might lie with the guy for not being honest about his intentions. Also, the author was trying to cope with the breakup by dating others, which is a common reaction.\n\nBut some might argue that if the guy kept contacting them after the breakup, the author could have realized the situation was still ongoing. However, the guy's friend later said the breakup was a test, which the author wasn't aware of. So the author had no way of knowing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't at fault because they made decisions based on the information they had. The guy's dishonesty is the root of the problem here.\n"
