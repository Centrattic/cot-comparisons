TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then started seeing others on Tinder and slept with people, thinking it was okay because they weren't dating anymore. Now, the guy says the breakup was a test, and he's angry she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she was wrong. Well, the key point here is the status of their relationship at the time she started seeing others. If he genuinely broke up with her, then she's not in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. But he later claimed it was a test and was still in love. \n\nThe problem is that he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. If he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty, then his initial breakup was dishonest. In that case, her mistake was trusting his word that it was over. She couldn't have known it was a test. So, she acted based on his stated intention to be friends, which he later contradicted. \n\nBut from her perspective, after a breakup, it's natural to move on. She tried to boost her self-esteem by dating again. If he was in love with her and wanted to test her reaction, then his behavior was manipulative. He set her up to fail by pretending to break up. So, he's the one being deceptive here. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she should've been clear about their status before moving on, but he was the one who ended the relationship. She had every right to start dating others after a breakup. His anger stems from his own manipulative actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the breakup wasn't real, and he manipulated the situation.\n"
