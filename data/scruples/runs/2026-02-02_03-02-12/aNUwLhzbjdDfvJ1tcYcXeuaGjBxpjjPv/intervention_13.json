TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then started dating other people on Tinder to boost her self-esteem and get over him. But then he told his friend that the breakup was a test to see what she would do, and now he's angry because she slept with others.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the nature of the breakup and the context in which she started seeing new people. If the breakup was genuine, then she wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But the guy later says it was a test, implying he never really wanted to break up. However, from her perspective, she had every reason to believe it was a real breakup. She was heartbroken, he was adamant they were just friends, so she moved on. \n\nCheating typically involves being unfaithful while still in a relationship. Since he said they were breaking up, even if it was a test, from her side, there's no indication she knew it wasn't final. She acted based on the information given to her. So she's not in the wrong for moving on after a breakup. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. He should have clarified that the breakup wasn't real if that was the case. \n\nAlso, using a breakup as a test is manipulative. If he was in love with her, he should have been honest instead of making her go through the emotional turmoil of a breakup only to later say it was a test. Her actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over, so she's not at fault. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
