TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross breaks up with Rachel, and she then dates someone else, which upsets Ross when he realizes he still loves her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and had sex with others. Later, she found out that the breakup was a test because he was still in love with her. He's now angry because she dated others while he was supposedly testing her. \n\nThe main question is whether she was wrong in sleeping with others after the breakup. From a moral standpoint, if the breakup was real and mutual, then the author isn't obligated to remain celibate. However, in this case, the guy later admitted it was a test. That complicates things because the breakup wasn't genuine. But the author didn't know that at the time. \n\nEthically, when a person breaks up with someone, the expectation is that the relationship is over. The author had every right to move on, especially since her self-esteem was low. However, the guy's actions were deceptive. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, that's his own emotional manipulation. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. \n\nThere's ambiguity here. If the breakup was real, then she's not wrong. If it was a test, then he's being dishonest. But since she didn't know it was a test, she can't be blamed for acting based on the breakup. Additionally, the fact that he blocked her and is now angry after revealing the test suggests he's being hypocritical. \n\nAnother angle: infidelity typically refers to cheating within an active relationship. Since they were not in a relationship at the time, technically, the author isn't cheating. However, if the breakup was a lie, then maybe he felt betrayed. But the key is that the author wasn't aware of the test, so her actions were justified based on the breakup. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted on the assumption that the breakup was real and had the right to move on. The guy's deception is the real issue here, not her decisions after the breakup.\n"
