TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's partner ended the relationship, claiming they wanted to be just friends. The author then started dating others on Tinder and slept with people, thinking it was okay since they were no longer a couple. The partner later revealed the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and now he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the initial breakup and the partner's test. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship, so they moved on. The partner, however, didn't actually end the relationship but used a fake breakup as a test. The author didn't know about the test and acted based on the assumption that they were free to date others.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, once the breakup was declared, the relationship was over. In most relationships, if one person says they want to break up, the other is expected to respect that. The author's actions were in response to being told the relationship was over and trying to move on. The partner's test is problematic because it's manipulative. By pretending to break up to see if the author would stay faithful, the partner set up a scenario where the author could be blamed for moving on, which is unfair.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the relationship wasn't truly over, then the author was unfaithful. But the partner didn't clarify that it was a test during the time. The author had no way of knowing. The responsibility lies with the partner for not being honest about their intentions. The author acted based on the information they had, which was that the relationship had ended.\n\nAdditionally, the partner's reaction now is hypocritical. They initiated the breakup and then got angry when the author moved on. The test was a way to justify anger without taking responsibility for their own manipulative behavior. The author is not in the wrong because they followed what they were told and tried to heal after being told the relationship was over. The real issue here is the partner's dishonesty and the test, not the author's actions.\n"
