TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where one person breaks up, and the other moves on, but there's some ambiguity about the breakup's validity.\n\nThe author believed they were in a breakup and were told by their partner to be just friends. The partner was adamant about ending the romantic relationship. The author then started dating others on Tinder and had sex with new people. Now, the partner is upset because the breakup was a test, and he was trying to see if the author would stay loyal. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. If the partner had genuinely ended the relationship, the author had no obligation to be faithful. The problem arises because the partner lied about the breakup being permanent. If the breakup was a test, that's manipulative and deceptive on the partner's part. The author made a decision based on what they were told. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they were given. The partner's actions (lying about the breakup being a test) are the main issue here. Cheating would occur if they were still in a committed relationship, but since the partner ended it, the author was within their rights to move on. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
