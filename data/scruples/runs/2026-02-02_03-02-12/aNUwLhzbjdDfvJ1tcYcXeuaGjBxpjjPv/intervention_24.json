TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to move on, started dating others through Tinder. Now the ex says the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and he's angry because she didn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the breakup was genuine or not. The ex claimed it was to be friends, but later admitted it was a test. That's a problem because if the breakup wasn't real, then the author might have thought it was over. The ex's actions here are a bit manipulative. If the guy was still in love and trying to test her loyalty without being honest, that's his fault. But the author thought they were broken up, so she didn't feel obligated to stay loyal. \n\nIn relationships, when someone says they want to be friends, it's usually considered a breakup. So the author's decision to move on might be justified. However, the issue is that the ex didn't communicate clearly. But the author did act on her assumption that the relationship was over. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. Also, trying to boost self-esteem after a breakup by seeing new people is a common reaction. \n\nThe ex's anger seems hypocritical because he didn't clarify his intentions. The problem stems from his lack of honesty. The author had no way of knowing it was a test unless he had communicated that. So, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong because the breakup was presented as final. The ex is the one who manipulated the situation by not being upfront. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
