TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, but it's a real-life story. The guy says he broke up with her, and they were supposed to be just friends. She then starts dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem because she was heartbroken. He later reveals he was testing her by breaking up, and now he's mad she slept with other people.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the definitions of a breakup and boundaries. If the guy actually ended the relationship and said they should be friends, then technically, she's not in a relationship anymore. So, from a logical standpoint, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating if the relationship was officially over. But the twist is he claims the breakup was a test. That complicates things because he never clearly communicated that the breakup wasn't real. If he was still in love and thought testing her by breaking up was okay, then there's an issue with his actions. \n\nHowever, the author assumed the relationship was over. She had no reason to believe otherwise. The guy didn't clarify that he was testing her. So, she acted based on his statement. If a breakup is mutual and there's no ambiguity, the ex has the right to move on. But here, the guy's approach was manipulative. He set up a false scenario and then got upset when she did what he thought she would do. That's being in the wrong, not her. \n\nAlso, emotional manipulation plays a role. She was heartbroken and trying to heal, which is understandable. The guy's anger stems from his own manipulative actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed his lead and the situation was miscommunicated from the start.\n"
