TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario but real. The key points here are the breakup's nature and the author's actions post-breakup.\n\nFirst, the guy claims they were broken up, so they were just friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and to boost self-esteem, starts dating others. But the guy later says the breakup was a test to see if she would be faithful. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the breakup was real. If the guy never actually ended the relationship and it was a test, then the author might be in the wrong for sleeping with others while still in the relationship. However, if the breakup was genuine, then the author had no obligation and isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe problem here is the ambiguity. The guy said they were just friends, so the author assumed a breakup. The guy's actions (talking to her after, not clarifying the test until after the fact) suggest poor communication. The author acted based on the assumption that the relationship was over. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are key. If the guy kept the breakup a secret test, that's a problem. The author didn't know it was still ongoing. So, the fault might lie more with the guy for not being upfront. But some might argue that sleeping with others while still in love and during a test could be seen as a breach of trust if the relationship wasn't actually ended. \n\nBut since the guy presented it as a breakup, the author had a reasonable assumption. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
