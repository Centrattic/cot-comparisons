TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy broke up with her, she started dating others after the breakup, and then found out that the breakup was a test. Now he's angry at her for sleeping with others when they weren't together.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy ended the relationship and said they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken, tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. She believed they were no longer a couple, so she didn't feel obligated to be faithful. Then the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see if she was faithful, which she failed, leading to his anger.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong. From a relationship ethics standpoint, fidelity is typically expected while in a committed relationship. However, the key here is the communication. The guy claimed the relationship was over, and the author acted based on that assumption. If the breakup was genuine, then the author was justified in moving on. However, if the guy intended for the breakup to be a test all along, that's a manipulation tactic, which is unethical.\n\nBut the problem is that the guy didn't communicate the test aspect. The author had no reason to believe it wasn't a real breakup. So from her perspective, she was following through with the breakup as he presented it. She wasn't aware it was a test, so her actions were based on the information she had. In that case, she might not be in the wrong because she wasn't intentionally cheating during the relationship. However, some might argue that even if the breakup was fake, she should have considered the possibility and not moved on so quickly. But that's a bit of a stretch because she had no indication of the test.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's actions are questionable. Using a breakup as a test is manipulative and deceptive. He set up a scenario where he could judge her actions without being honest about his intentions. That's a breach of trust and respect. The author's mistake was trusting his claim of a breakup, but she can't be blamed for that. The fault lies more with the guy for not being truthful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted under the belief that the relationship was over. The guy's actions were deceptive, and the author had no way of knowing it was a test. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
