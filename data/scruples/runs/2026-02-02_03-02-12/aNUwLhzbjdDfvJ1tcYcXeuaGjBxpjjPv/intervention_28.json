TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story did something wrong. The situation is that the author thought her relationship had ended, so she started seeing other people. But then the guy said he was testing her, and now he's angry because she slept with others even though they weren't officially together anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy broke up with her, claiming they should be friends. She was heartbroken and tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. She believed they were no longer in a relationship, so she thought her actions were okay. Then he revealed it was a test, which complicates things.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, fidelity is typically expected when a relationship is ongoing. But once it's broken off, unless there's an agreement otherwise, the expectation might change. The guy's test adds a layer of manipulation. He pretended to breakup to see her reaction, which isn't honest. If he didn't communicate properly and led her to believe it was over, then she acting on that belief might not be wrong.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the relationship ended, emotional ties could still be present, and sleeping with others might have hurt his feelings if he was still attached. But the problem here is his lack of transparency. He didn't make his intentions clear. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. If he was still in love with her and wanted to test her, he shouldn't have broken up in the first place if he wasn't committed to ending it. His actions set the stage for the confusion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have considered that maybe he wasn't entirely done, but he never gave any signals to the contrary. If he truly wanted to stay friends, he should have communicated that without ambiguity. Her decision to move on was based on his initial breakup. The fact that he was testing her is a red flag, but his anger at her for moving on when he led her to believe the relationship was over could mean he's the one being unfair here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the breakup he initiated. His test was manipulative, and he's now holding her accountable for something that was based on his initial decision to end things. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
