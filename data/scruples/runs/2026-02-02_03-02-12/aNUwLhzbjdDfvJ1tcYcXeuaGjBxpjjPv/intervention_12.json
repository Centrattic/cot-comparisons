TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but the other person didn't reciprocate the same level of feelings. The guy decided to break up, opting for just being friends, and the author went along with it. After some time, the author started dating others on Tinder to boost their self-esteem, thinking they were no longer in a relationship. Then, when the ex found out, he got angry and blocked them, later revealing that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the relationship actually over? The guy said it was a breakup to be friends, but he later admitted it was a test. The author believed they were no longer a couple, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. However, if the guy didn't actually break up but was testing her loyalty, that's a different scenario. \n\nBut wait, the guy said \"we should just be friends\" which typically signals the end of a relationship. The author had every reason to believe the relationship was over. Acting on that belief by moving on isn't wrong. The guy's actions of making a fake breakup to test her are manipulative. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information given. The fault lies with the guy for being deceptive. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
