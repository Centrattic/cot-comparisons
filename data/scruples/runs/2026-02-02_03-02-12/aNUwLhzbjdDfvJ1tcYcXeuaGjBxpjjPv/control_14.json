TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy (ex?) broke up with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts using Tinder and sleeps with others. Then, when she accidentally reveals this, he gets mad and blocks her. Turns out he broke up as a test to see if she'd stay faithful. \n\nHmm. The key points here are the nature of the breakup and the intentions of both people. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship and thus felt it was okay to move on. The guy, however, claims it was a test. \n\nBut wait, if he was in love with her and just wanted to see her reaction, was it fair to initiate a breakup as a test? That seems manipulative. The author had no way of knowing it was a test. She acted based on the information given. Sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice, but if there's an assumption of being single, then maybe it's not wrong. \n\nHowever, the guy's approach was deceptive. Using a breakup as a test to check loyalty is unethical. The author couldn't be expected to know his intentions. So, in this scenario, the guy's actions are questionable. The author acted in good faith, thinking they were over. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
