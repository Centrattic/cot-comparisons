TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that the guy later claimed was a test. \n\nFirst, the key facts here are that the guy initially told the author they needed to be just friends, and she assumed it was a breakup. She then moved on by dating others on Tinder. He later revealed he was testing her loyalty, which she wasn't aware of at the time. Now he's upset and blocked her.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she believed the relationship was over. If a relationship has ended, it's generally acceptable for someone to move on and date others. However, the man's actions complicate things because he didn't communicate his true intentions. He broke up with her to see if she would stay loyal, which is manipulative. \n\nThe author's actions are based on the assumption that the breakup was final. She didn't know it was a test, so she acted accordingly. In that context, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong if the relationship is truly over. The man's anger might stem from his own manipulative behavior and unmet expectations, not from the author's actions per se.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should have clarified the breakup's status. However, the man was adamant about being friends, so she had no reason to think it was a test. The responsibility here could lie with the man for not being honest about his intentions. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had at the time. The man's test and subsequent anger are issues on his part. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
