TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy (let's call him G) broke up with the author (A), claiming they should just be friends. A was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others to boost her self-esteem. Then G later says the breakup was a test to see what A would do, and he's furious she slept with others. Now he's blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. G said they were breaking up and wanted to be friends. At that point, A thought the relationship was over, so she moved on. She didn't do anything while they were still in a relationship. The key point here is whether the breakup was real or a \"test.\" If G never intended to end the relationship and was just testing A's loyalty, then his actions might be manipulative. However, A had no way of knowing that. She acted based on what he told her, which was that they were just friends now. \n\nSo, if the breakup was legitimate, then A has done nothing wrong. She moved on after the breakup, which is normal. But if the breakup was a test, then maybe he's holding her to standards of a relationship even after his own \"breakup.\" But the problem is, the breakup was only a test, and he never communicated that. So, A's actions were based on the information she had at the time. \n\nIn terms of accountability, G's actions seem deceptive. He didn't clearly communicate his intentions and then later blames her for something that happened after he supposedly ended the relationship. The issue here is the lack of honesty from G. If he wanted to test her, that's a form of manipulation. Meanwhile, A acted in a way that's typical when someone is trying to recover after a breakup.\n\nHowever, some might argue that G's feelings are valid because he's still in love with her, and she moved on. But the main issue is whether she was in a relationship with him when she did those things. Since he claimed they were just friends, she had no obligation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed through with the breakup as communicated. The problem lies with G's dishonesty and manipulative behavior by pretending to break up to test her loyalty.\n"
