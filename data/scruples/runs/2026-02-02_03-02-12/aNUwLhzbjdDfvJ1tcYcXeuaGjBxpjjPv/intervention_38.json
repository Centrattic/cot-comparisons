TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, claiming he wanted to be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and wanting to rebuild self-esteem, started using Tinder and slept with others. The guy later says the breakup was a test and is now angry about the author's actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the breakup. The guy said it was a breakup, so the author believed they were no longer in a relationship. If that's the case, then the author's actions after the breakup are her own business, right? Cheating typically refers to being unfaithful while in a relationship. If they were officially not in a relationship anymore, then sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But there's a part where he says he was still in love and it was a test to see her reaction. However, the author had no way of knowing that. The guy didn't communicate his intentions clearly. He told her it was a breakup, so she acted accordingly. \n\nAlso, the guy's anger seems misplaced. If the breakup was mutual and final, then his anger at her dating others after is not justified. The problem might be that the guy didn't actually want a breakup and was testing her commitment, which is a bit manipulative. He didn't set clear boundaries or communicate his true feelings. The author followed his lead and when he changed his mind, she's being blamed for something she couldn't have foreseen. \n\nAnother angle: emotional infidelity. But the author isn't in a relationship anymore, so even if she's still in love with him, she's not in a position where she has to be faithful. The key here is the communication. The guy didn't make it clear that he was still emotionally tied and using the breakup as a test. The author had no obligation to stay away from others once the relationship was supposedly over. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the breakup was communicated as final, and the guy's subsequent anger stems from his own unclear intentions. The fault lies more with him for not being honest about his plans to test her.\n"
