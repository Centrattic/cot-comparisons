TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the setup: The user was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but the partner didn't reciprocate the same feelings. The partner ended the relationship, saying they wanted to be friends. The user, heartbroken but moving on, started using Tinder and slept with others. The partner later revealed the breakup was a test to see how the user would respond. Now the partner is angry and blocked them.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The user thought the relationship was over and had decided to move on. They acted based on the information they had at the time. The partner, however, had a different intention. But the user didn't know about the test. Did the partner communicate clearly? No. He broke up, which is a clear end to the relationship in most contexts unless specified otherwise. The user's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over and that they were free to date others. \n\nIn relationships, fidelity is usually expected when both are in a committed state. However, once a breakup occurs, especially if the ex-partner hasn't set boundaries about post-breakup interactions, the expectation changes. The user didn't engage in any deceit during the breakup; they acted on the assumption that the breakup was real. The partner's test was a manipulation tactic, which is problematic because it's not transparent. The user isn't at fault here because they had no reason to know it was a test. They were trying to heal and regain self-esteem after being dumped. The partner's anger stems from a lack of communication and a setup of false expectations. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. The partner's responsibility lies in being honest about their intentions and not using emotional manipulation. The user acted in good faith based on the breakup they were given.\n"
