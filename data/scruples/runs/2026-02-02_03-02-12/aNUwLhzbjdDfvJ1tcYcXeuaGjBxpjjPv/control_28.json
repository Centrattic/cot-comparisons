TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is at fault. The scenario involves a breakup, the author moving on by sleeping with others, and then the ex using a \"test\" as an excuse for blocking them.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy broke up with the author, claiming they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts seeing others on Tinder to feel better. Later, the ex reveals the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. He's now angry and refuses to talk.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, when someone is in a relationship and their partner breaks up, they're not obligated to remain faithful. The author was under the impression the relationship was over, so moving on isn't inherently wrong. However, the ex's actions complicate things. The guy claimed a breakup but was actually testing loyalty, which is manipulative. The author didn't know the breakup was a test, so they acted based on the information they had.\n\nThe ex's behavior is problematic because he didn't communicate his intentions. The author isn't at fault for acting on the breakup's implication. Even though they moved on, the ex's test makes his anger seem hypocritical. The author's actions were a response to being told the relationship was over. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author made decisions based on the breakup being real.\n"
