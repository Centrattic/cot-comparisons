TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with the author, saying he just wanted to be friends. The author then moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. The guy later admitted that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay loyal. Now he's angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy ended the relationship and said they should be friends. If a breakup is mutual and the person is clear about moving on, then the ex has no right to expect fidelity. The author thought it was a real breakup, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. The twist is that the guy was testing her, but that's his own issue. He didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions. The author acted on her belief that the relationship was over. So, is she wrong? If you break up, you're supposed to be free to date. The fact that he lied about his intentions complicates things. But the author didn't know he was testing her; she acted on his stated decision to end the relationship. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because she made decisions based on his initial breakup statement. The responsibility lies with him for being deceptive. So the answer would be B.\n"
