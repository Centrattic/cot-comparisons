TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross supposedly breaks up with Rachel for testing purposes.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship where her partner didn't express the same level of commitment. He then called it off, saying they should just be friends. She tried to move on by dating others on Tinder after the breakup. Now, he's upset because he claims the breakup was a test and he's still in love with her, so he's angry she moved on.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Was the author wrong to date others after a breakup? Generally, once a relationship is over, each person can pursue their own path. If the guy truly ended the relationship, the author isn't obligated to remain celibate. However, the twist here is that the guy's breakup was a test. Did he have the right to do that? Maybe not, but that's his choice. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. She believed the breakup was real. Now she's being blamed because his test was a ruse. That's a bit manipulative on his part. \n\nSo, if the breakup was genuine, then the author's actions are justified. But if the breakup was fake, then she wasn't in the wrong because she didn't know. The key point is intent. The author didn't cheat while they were still a couple. She moved on after the breakup, which is a natural response. The guy's test adds a layer of manipulation, but it doesn't make the author at fault. He should have been honest about his intentions. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
