TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually started talking again. Then she got on Tinder and slept with other people because she thought they weren't together anymore. The guy later revealed that the breakup was actually a test to see what she would do, and now he's angry because she cheated when he thought they were still a couple.\n\nHmm, the key points here are whether the breakup was real or not. If she believed the breakup was real, then technically they weren't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But the guy later said it was a test, meaning he never actually intended to break up. That's a bit of a twist. \n\nFrom her perspective, she acted based on the information she had at the time. She thought they were over, so she moved on. But the guy's actions of making it a test without clear communication could be problematic. He didn't tell her it was a test; he just broke up with her. So she wasn't aware that he was still considering them in a relationship. \n\nHowever, the issue is that he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty. If she had known the breakup wasn't real, she might have acted differently. But since he didn't communicate that, it's not her fault she didn't know. \n\nBut wait, maybe there were hints he was in love. The story says he never told her he felt as strongly, but hinted sometimes. Maybe she should have realized he wasn't serious about the breakup. But that's not necessarily her responsibility. People can be ambiguous in their communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's approach is manipulative. Using a breakup as a test is not a healthy way to handle things. If he was still in love, he should have clarified his feelings instead of testing her. She trusted his decision to break up, so she acted accordingly. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. If he didn't communicate that the breakup was a test, then the blame isn't entirely on her. She made decisions based on the information given. So, she's not in the wrong. The guy's actions are more to blame for not being clear. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
