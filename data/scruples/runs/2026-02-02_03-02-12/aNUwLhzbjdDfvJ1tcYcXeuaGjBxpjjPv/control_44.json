TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was in a relationship with a guy who broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken, then after some time, she started using Tinder and slept with other people. Now, the guy claims that breaking up was a test to see how she would react, and he's angry because she slept with others even though they weren't dating anymore. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy said they should be friends, and the author thought the relationship was over. If the breakup was real, then the author wouldn't be in the wrong for moving on and exploring other relationships. However, the guy later admitted it was a test, meaning he never intended to break up. That's tricky because it's not clear if the author knew this at the time. \n\nThe key point here is communication. If the guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test, then the author had every right to believe the relationship was over. She was trying to heal her self-esteem after a breakup, which is understandable. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the relationship was officially over. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's actions of using a fake breakup as a test is problematic. He didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions, which led to the author acting on the assumption that they were no longer a couple. The guy might feel betrayed, but if the author didn't know it was a test, she couldn't be expected to act differently. \n\nAlso, the guy's anger seems to stem from his own hidden agenda. His friend mentioned he was still in love with her, so his test was to see if she was faithful. But by not being transparent, he set up a situation where the author had no way to know the truth. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If the guy wanted to maintain the relationship, he should have communicated that instead of creating a situation where the author thought she was single. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had at the time, which was a breakup. The guy's actions were deceptive, leading to this conflict.\n"
