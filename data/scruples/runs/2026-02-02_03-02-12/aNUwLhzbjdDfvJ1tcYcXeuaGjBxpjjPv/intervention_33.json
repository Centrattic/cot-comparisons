TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the situation thought they were in a breakup but then the guy later said it was a test. The author slept with others after the breakup and now the guy is angry. \n\nFirst, the key point is whether the author was actually in a breakup. If the guy never ended the relationship but was just testing the author, then technically there wasn't a breakup. But the author assumed there was a breakup because he said it was better to be friends. However, the guy's friend later clarified that the breakup was a test.\n\nWait, but in reality, if someone says they want to be friends after a breakup, it's usually a real decision. The problem here is that the guy lied about the breakup being final. The author acted on the information given. If the guy was still in love and wanted to test the author, that's his own manipulative behavior. The author had no way of knowing it wasn't a real breakup at the time. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014sleeping with others\u2014were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. Since the guy didn't maintain communication boundaries or clarify his intentions, the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies with the guy for not being honest and setting up a test without clear communication. The author's decision to move on by dating others isn't unethical if they believed the relationship was ended. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
