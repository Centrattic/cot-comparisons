TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup, which the author believed was a breakup. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the communication between the two people. The guy said he wanted to be just friends, which led the author to believe the relationship was over. Based on that, the author started using Tinder and had relationships with others. Now, the guy is claiming that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay loyal, and he's upset because she didn't.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author had a right to assume the relationship was over. If the guy clearly stated they were breaking up and wanted to be friends, then the author's actions might be justified because she believed the relationship was terminated. However, if there was any ambiguity or if the guy never explicitly ended the relationship, that's on him for not communicating clearly.\n\nBut in this case, the guy did say it was a breakup. The author had no reason to believe he was still in love with her or that he was testing her. His friend later reveals that the breakup was a test, but that's an after-the-fact justification. The author acted based on the information she had at the time, which was that they were no longer a couple. Sleeping with others after a breakup, even if it's to boost self-esteem, is a personal choice, and if both parties agreed to end the relationship, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of emotional maturity. The guy might feel betrayed, but if he didn't make his intentions clear, he can't blame the author for moving on. The author acted in good faith based on the breakup. The problem lies more with the guy's dishonesty and lack of clear communication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she made a decision based on the breakup she was told about. The guy's test was underhanded and not communicated properly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
