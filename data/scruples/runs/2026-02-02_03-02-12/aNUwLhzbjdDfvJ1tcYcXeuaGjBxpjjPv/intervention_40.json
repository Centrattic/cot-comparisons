TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's partner ended the relationship, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and with low self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. Later, they found out the partner had broken up as a test to see the author's reaction. Now the partner is angry about the author sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author thought the relationship was over. The partner didn't communicate clearly, using a breakup as a test. The author had no way of knowing that. The partner's actions were deceptive. The author's decision to date others was based on the assumption that the relationship was over. Cheating usually involves being in a committed relationship, but here, the author believed it was over. So, the author might not be in the wrong because the partner was being dishonest. However, some might argue that sleeping with others right after a breakup could be seen as moving on quickly, but the key point here is whether the relationship was actually still ongoing. Since the partner lied about the breakup's intent, the author can't be blamed for acting on what they believed was the truth. So, the answer is B.\n"
