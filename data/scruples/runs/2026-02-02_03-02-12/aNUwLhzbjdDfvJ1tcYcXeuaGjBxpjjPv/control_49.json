TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is that the author was in a relationship with a guy. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually started talking to him as friends. Then, to boost her self-esteem, she used Tinder and slept with others. Now he's angry because he says the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and she failed. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The guy ended the relationship, so from her perspective, they were no longer dating. She thought they were just friends, so she didn't feel obligated to be faithful anymore. She used Tinder and slept with others during this time. But then he admits the breakup was a test. Now, the guy is upset because he wanted to see if she'd stay loyal, and she didn't.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions of both parties. If the guy never actually broke up, just pretended, then she was in a relationship still. But she had no reason to believe that. He told her they were just friends, which is a clear indication of ending the romantic relationship. She acted based on that information. So if he lied about the breakup being real, then she's in the right because she had no way of knowing. However, if he did genuinely end the relationship, then her actions were okay because they were not in a relationship anymore.\n\nBut the problem is that the guy's actions were deceptive. He didn't communicate his true intentions. He told her to break up, and then later claims it was a test. That's a form of manipulation. The author can't be expected to read his mind. She made a decision based on his stated intentions. So in that case, she's not in the wrong because he was the one who was dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, if you consider that once a relationship is broken off, even if it's a new relationship, the former partner is supposed to act with some level of restraint. But if the breakup was mutual, then she's allowed to date again. However, in this case, the guy never actually ended the relationship, he just tested her. So in that case, she was acting on the information given and the guy is at fault here. The answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
