TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup, the author sleeping with others, and the ex being upset because the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy broke up, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others on Tinder. Then the guy revealed the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. He's now angry and blocked her.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author did wrong by sleeping with others after the breakup. Since the breakup was supposed to be final, she acted based on that assumption. Even if it turned out he wasn't really ending the relationship, she had no way of knowing that. Cheating usually involves a current relationship, but they were supposed to be over. So technically, she wasn't cheating. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if he was testing her, she didn't know, so she can't be blamed. On the other hand, maybe she should have communicated more or waited to move on. But given the info she had, she made a decision that was reasonable. The guy's actions (testing the breakup) are questionable too. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup being real. The fault lies with him for using a breakup as a test. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
