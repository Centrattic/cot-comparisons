TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and to boost self-esteem, started dating others via Tinder and had sex. Later, she found out that the guy had broken up with her as a test to see if she'd stay loyal, and he's now mad at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The guy initiated the breakup, claiming they should be friends. The author believed it was over and thus felt free to move on. But then it turns out he was testing her loyalty, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, once a breakup is declared, especially by the other person, it's reasonable to assume the relationship is over. She's acting on that assumption by moving on. She's not in the wrong for trying to heal and regain self-esteem after being dumped. \n\nHowever, the guy's actions complicate things. By using a breakup as a test, he's not being honest. His anger at her sleeping with others when they weren't a couple might be more about his own control issues rather than her actions. Legally and socially, once a relationship is ended, both parties are free to date others. \n\nBut there's a nuance here: if the guy never actually ended the relationship and was just testing her, then the author's actions might be seen as breaking trust. However, the problem is that he didn't communicate his test clearly. He led her to believe it was over, which she accepted. \n\nIn relationships, consent and communication are key. If someone ends the relationship, the other person is within their rights to move on. The fact that he was testing her without being honest is a red flag. His reaction seems more about betrayal because she didn't pass his test rather than any actual wrongdoing on her part. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup he declared. His test was dishonest, and his anger stems from manipulation rather than her actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
