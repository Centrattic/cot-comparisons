TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The main points are:\n\nThe author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate the same way. He broke up, saying they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others, thinking they were no longer in a relationship. Then, the guy revealed that the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. He's now angry and blocked them.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author was in a committed relationship when they slept with others. If the guy ended the relationship and they were just friends, then the author isn't cheating. But if the breakup wasn't mutual or clear, there could be ambiguity. However, the guy said he was breaking up, so the author had a right to believe the relationship was over. The problem is the guy's actions\u2014using a fake breakup as a test is manipulative. The author acted based on the information they had. So, the author isn't at fault; the guy's dishonesty is the root issue. Answer B.\n"
