TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the story was in a relationship where the other person broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be just friends. The author, heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others, thinking they were no longer in a relationship. Then the ex says the breakup was a test, and now he's angry because the author was with others even though he claims he was still in love.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the clarity of the breakup and consent from both parties. The ex didn't communicate clearly that he was still in love and that the breakup was a test. The author assumed they were over and acting accordingly. Cheating usually requires a current relationship or mutual agreement. Since the ex claims it was a test, maybe the author had no reason to know they were still in the relationship. The ex's actions of being adamant about being friends might have led the author to believe the split was real. The author wasn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had. The ex's test was deceptive, so the blame lies more on him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
