TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's partner ended the relationship, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then moved on, used Tinder, and slept with others. The partner later revealed it was a test to see if the author would stay loyal, and he's upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The partner said they were just friends, so the author assumed the relationship was over. In that case, the author might not have felt obligated to remain faithful. But the partner later says it was a test, which complicates things. \n\nBut wait, if the breakup was real, then the author isn't in the wrong for moving on. However, if the partner faked the breakup to test loyalty, that's a different angle. The key here is whether the breakup was genuine. The author believed it was a breakup, so acting accordingly might be reasonable. However, the partner's intention to test loyalty could imply that the author didn't know the true situation. \n\nBut the author didn't know it was a test. They acted based on the information given. So, in that case, the author isn't at fault for sleeping with others after a breakup. The partner's actions (faking a breakup to test) are problematic. The author's mistake might be not clarifying the situation, but the partner's deception is the main issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the breakup as communicated, even if the partner lied about the reasons. The partner's behavior is questionable, not the author's.\n"
