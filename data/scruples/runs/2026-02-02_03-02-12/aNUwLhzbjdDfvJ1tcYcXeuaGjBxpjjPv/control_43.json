TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, and they started seeing other people. But now the partner says the breakup was a test to see what the author would do, and they're angry about the author sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline and the communication between both parties. The guy called it a breakup and said they should just be friends. The author took that at face value and moved on. But if the guy later claims it was a test, that's a problem. Did he communicate clearly that it was a breakup? If he said they were just friends, the author might have reasonably believed the relationship was over. Then, moving on by seeing others isn't necessarily wrong. However, the guy's actions (immediately blocking and getting angry) are problematic because he didn't clarify his intentions.\n\nAnother angle: in a breakup, even if it's a test, once one person says it's over, the other is free to pursue new relationships. The guy's test was a manipulative tactic. The author didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on the information given. The fault here might lie with the guy for not being honest and for using a breakup as a test. But the author didn't explicitly confirm the breakup's finality, which could be a point. However, it's generally expected that if someone says they want to be just friends, you respect that. The author's actions are justified if the breakup was real. But if it was a test, maybe the author was wrong for moving on without clarification. Wait, but the guy never said it was a test. The author had no way of knowing. So the guy's anger seems misplaced. The key is whether the breakup was genuine. If the author believed it was over and the guy didn't tell them it was a test, then the author isn't at fault. The guy's behavior is more questionable here. But some might argue that if the guy still had feelings, the author should have waited. However, the author's self-esteem was low, and the guy didn't express his intentions clearly. So the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
