TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where a breakup is declared, but one person later realizes they weren't actually broken up.\n\nFirst, the key points are: The guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, believing they were no longer in a relationship, started dating others on Tinder and had sex with multiple people. The guy later claims the breakup was a test to see if she would stay loyal, and now is upset because she didn't. The author is still in love with him, and now he's blocked her and refuses to talk.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author do something wrong by sleeping with others after the breakup? Let's consider the facts. The guy initiated the breakup and was clear about wanting to be friends only. The author, feeling rejected and trying to rebuild her self-esteem, moved on. If the breakup was genuine and not a test, then the author isn't in the wrong because once a relationship is over, both parties are free to date others. However, if the guy was still in love and considered the breakup a test, his actions might have been manipulative from the start. \n\nBut here's the catch: The guy didn't clarify the status of their relationship. If he said they were breaking up but didn't specify that it was a trial separation, the author had every right to believe the relationship was over. Cheating typically involves being in a committed relationship and engaging with others without the partner's consent. In this case, the author wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, the guy's claim that the breakup was a test raises red flags about his intentions and communication. \n\nThe problem arises from the lack of clear communication. The guy didn't set boundaries if he intended to test her, and the author acted on her belief that they were separated. Since the author didn't know it was a test, she can't be blamed for acting on the information she had. The guy is in the wrong for not being honest and for using a breakup as a test, which is a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed the breakup as communicated, and it's the guy's responsibility to have been clear from the start. So the answer would be B.\n"
