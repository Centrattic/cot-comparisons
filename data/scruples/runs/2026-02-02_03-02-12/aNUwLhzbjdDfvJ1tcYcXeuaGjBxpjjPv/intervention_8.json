TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after what they thought was a breakup. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy broke up with her, they were no longer in a relationship. The author assumed it was a real breakup, not a test. He told her he wanted to be friends, which she took as a definitive end. After the breakup, she used Tinder and slept with others, which she thought was okay because they weren't together anymore. Later, she found out that the breakup was actually a test, and he was still in love. He's furious now because she slept with others during this time.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she believed they were no longer a couple. The guy was the one who initiated the breakup, so she had no obligation to remain faithful. She even mentions he said it would be better to be friends, which makes it seem like a real breakup. She acted on her own to rebuild her self-esteem, which is a common reaction after a breakup. The problem arises because the guy was using a test, which is a manipulative tactic. He never clarifying that the breakup wasn't real, so she couldn't have known. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since she acted based on his initial breakup and his insistence on being friends, she's not at fault. The guy's actions (using a test without clear communication) are the root issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
