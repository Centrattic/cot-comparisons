TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's partner ended the relationship, and then the author started dating others. Now the ex is upset because he actually didn't mean to break up and was testing the author's loyalty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy said they should just be friends, and the author assumed it was a breakup. The author then moved on by getting back into the dating scene. The key issue here is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup.\n\nBut wait, the ex says the breakup was a test. So, from the author's perspective, the relationship was over. Even if the ex had mixed signals, the author had every reason to believe they were no longer in a relationship. Cheating typically means being unfaithful while in a committed relationship. Since the author thought the relationship was over, sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. \n\nHowever, the ex's intention was to test the author's loyalty, which complicates things. But the author didn't know that. The ex's actions of breaking up and saying they should be friends, even if it was a test, would lead a reasonable person to think the relationship had ended. So the author's actions were based on the assumption that they were no longer in a relationship. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for acting on the breakup. If the ex had given mixed signals but still said it was over, the author isn't at fault for moving on. The ex's mistake was in creating a situation where the author had no reason to remain loyal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
