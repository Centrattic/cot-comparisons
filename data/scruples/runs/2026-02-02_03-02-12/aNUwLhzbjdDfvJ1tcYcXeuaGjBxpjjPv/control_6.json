TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author was in a relationship with a guy who broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. After the breakup, she used Tinder and slept with others to boost her self-esteem. The guy later revealed the breakup was a test to see how she'd react, and now he's angry and blocked her. The author is wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sequence of events. The guy ended the relationship and said they should be friends. The author, believing it was over, moved on by dating others. The key point here is whether the breakup was genuine. The guy later admitted it was a test, implying he never actually wanted to end the relationship. But at the time, the author had no way of knowing that. \n\nFrom a conventional standpoint, if the relationship was officially over, then the author isn't cheating by moving on. However, the guy's actions were deceptive. By pretending to break up and then testing her reaction, he created a situation where his expectations might be conflicting. But the author acted based on the information she had at the time. \n\nAlso, the guy's anger seems to stem from her moving on, which he didn't expect. If he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty, but then got upset when she did what he told her to do (be friends and move on), that's a bit contradictory. \n\nBut there's another angle: the guy might have felt that even if they were broken up, there was some unspoken rule that she shouldn't date others. However, typically, after a breakup, unless there's an agreed-upon period of being \"on a break,\" you can move on. Since he said they should be friends, and didn't set any boundaries about other relationships, the author's actions are justifiable. \n\nThe deception part is tricky. The guy's friend told her that the breakup was a test. So maybe he intended to get back together but wanted to test her reaction. But the author had no way of knowing that. She acted in good faith. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she made decisions based on the breakup he initiated. His anger seems misplaced because he set up a situation where he wanted to test her but was upset with the outcome. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the guy's feelings were valid, but the fault lies in his deceptive actions rather than the author's. The author's actions were a natural response to a breakup. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
