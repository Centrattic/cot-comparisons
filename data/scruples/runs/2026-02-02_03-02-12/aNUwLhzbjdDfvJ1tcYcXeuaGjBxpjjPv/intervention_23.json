TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy never confirmed his feelings. He broke up with her, saying they should be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually started talking to others using Tinder and slept with new people. Then she mentioned this, and he got angry because he had actually broken up with her as a test to see her reaction. Now he's blocking her and refuses to talk.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the ambiguity of the breakup. The guy claimed it was a breakup for friendship, but later the author's friend says it was a test. So the guy never clearly communicated his intent. The author assumed it was a real breakup and acted accordingly. She slept with others because she thought they were no longer in a relationship. The guy, however, intended to test her loyalty, which is a bit manipulative in itself.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, infidelity is typically considered wrong when there's a commitment. But in this case, the author believed the relationship was over. If the breakup was genuine, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, if the breakup was a test (as revealed later), then the author might have been in a de facto relationship still. But the problem here is that the guy never made his intentions clear. He used a breakup as a test, which is deceptive. The author had no way of knowing his true intentions.\n\nSo, the author acted based on the information she had. The guy's deception complicates things. While sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating if the breakup is real, if the guy was still emotionally involved and using the breakup as a test, she might have been in the middle of a confusing situation. But the main issue is the lack of clear communication from the guy. The author isn't in the wrong for acting on the assumption that the relationship was over. The guy's test is the manipulative part here. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
