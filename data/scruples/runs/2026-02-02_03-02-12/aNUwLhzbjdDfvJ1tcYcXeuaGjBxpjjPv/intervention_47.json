TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, where Ross breaks up with Rachel, then later realizes he's in love with her again.\n\nFirst, the guy (author) was in a relationship where he was in love, but the other person didn't feel the same way. The guy broke up with her, saying it was better to be friends. The author was heartbroken but eventually accepted the breakup. Then, to boost her self-esteem, she started using Tinder and slept with other people. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. However, the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see what she would do, and he's now angry and blocked her.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the nature of the breakup. The guy initiated the breakup by saying they should be friends. The author took that at face value and moved on. If the guy's intention was to test her, that's a problem because he didn't communicate his actual feelings or intentions. In a breakup, both parties need to be clear. If he broke up with her and then expected her to stay single while he tested her, that's not fair. The author had no obligation to remain faithful once they were no longer in a relationship. However, her actions might have been a way to heal, but the guy's test was manipulative. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she did sleep with others after a breakup, which is a common way to move on. But if the breakup was a test, then maybe she didn't know the true nature of the breakup. However, the guy can't blame her for acting on the information he provided. If he genuinely broke up with her, she's within her rights to move on. The real issue is with the guy's lack of honesty and his use of a test as a breakup reason. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
