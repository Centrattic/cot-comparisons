TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is that the person was in a relationship where the guy ended it, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to rebuild their self-esteem, started dating others through Tinder and had sex. Now the guy says he broke up as a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and he's angry she slept with others, even though they weren't official anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the nature of the breakup and the expectations each party had. The guy broke up with her, and she assumed it was a real breakup. If he told her it was a test, maybe she didn't know that. But he didn't communicate that clearly. When someone breaks up, the expectation is usually that the relationship is over. So sleeping with other people after a breakup isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the ex had already said they wanted to be friends and there's no ongoing relationship.\n\nHowever, if the guy considered it a breakup but still wanted to test her loyalty, that's on him. He didn't clarify his intentions. The author acted based on his initial breakup statement. So maybe the guy is being hypocritical here. She wasn't in a relationship anymore, so she wasn't cheating. The problem is that he created a situation where he wanted to maintain some control without being clear about his true intentions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have waited or communicated more, but he didn't set boundaries. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, he shouldn't have ended the relationship in a way that led her to believe it was over. His actions were deceptive, so the fault might lie with him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup he declared, and his anger stems from his own manipulative behavior.\n"
