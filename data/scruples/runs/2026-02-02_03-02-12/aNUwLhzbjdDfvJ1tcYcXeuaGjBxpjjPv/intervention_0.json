TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with the author, claiming they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with other people. Then the guy turned out to have broken up as a test to see how she would react. He's now angry because she slept with others while they were \"just friends,\" and he's in love with her still.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered wrong in relationships. If you're in a relationship, being unfaithful is typically seen as wrong. But here, the guy ended the relationship. The author thought it was over, so she started seeing other people. If the breakup was real, then she's not in the wrong for moving on. However, the twist is that the guy's breakup was a test. \n\nBut wait, if he ended the relationship, even if it was a test, then from her perspective, they weren't together anymore. She had a right to move on. The fact that he didn't communicate his intentions clearly is on him. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, that's a bit manipulative. The author acted based on the information she had. \n\nAlso, in relationships, honesty is key. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, he should have been upfront. By pretending to break up, he set up a scenario where she could be judged for acting on the breakup. That's not fair. \n\nSo, if the breakup was real, she's not wrong. If it wasn't, then his actions are the issue. Since the guy created a false scenario, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with him for not being honest. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
