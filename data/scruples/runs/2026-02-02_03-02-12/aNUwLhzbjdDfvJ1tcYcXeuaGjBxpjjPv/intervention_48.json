TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the guy said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others to boost their self-esteem. Later, the guy says the breakup was a test and is now angry because the author slept with others. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basic principles here. When someone breaks up with you, unless there's some agreement otherwise, they're no longer a part of your romantic relationship. So if the guy explicitly said it was over and they should be friends, then the author isn't obligated to be faithful anymore. The guy made a choice to end the relationship, and the author took that at face value. \n\nBut then there's the twist where the guy says it was a test. But if he was still in love and wanted to see the author's reaction, that's a bit manipulative. By pretending to break up, he's playing a game with the author's emotions. The author didn't know that, though. The author acted based on the information they had at the time.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were about self-esteem and moving on. It's common for people to seek emotional support and new connections after a breakup. The fact that the author is still in love with the guy complicates things, but the actions taken were in response to the breakup being declared. \n\nThe guy's anger seems to stem from the idea that the author didn't \"pass\" his test. But by ending the relationship, even if it was a test, he set the stage for the author to move on. The author isn't responsible for his hidden motives. The guy's actions (breaking up and then playing a test) could be seen as deceitful. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are key. The guy didn't communicate his true intentions. The author made decisions based on the breakup being real. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being upfront and for creating a situation where the author felt the breakup was final.\n"
