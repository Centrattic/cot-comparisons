TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's ex decided to break up, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author, trying to move on and boost self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. Then the ex revealed the breakup was a test, and he's angry now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author thought the relationship was over. When someone breaks up with you, even if there's lingering feelings, the general expectation is that the relationship is ending. If that's the case, then moving on by dating others would be understandable, especially if the ex didn't make it clear that this was a test. The ex's actions here are a bit manipulative because he set up a scenario where he could test the author's response, but then gets upset when she followed through on what he told her to do. \n\nBut wait, the ex's friend mentioned the breakup was a test. That means the ex never actually ended the relationship in a genuine way. If the breakup wasn't real, then maybe the author was justified in moving on. However, the key point is communication. Did the ex make it clear enough that the breakup wasn't real? If he said it was over and the author had no reason to believe otherwise, then sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice and not the author's fault. The ex's anger seems to stem from his own manipulative test, not from the author's actions being wrong.\n\nAnother angle is trust. If the ex was testing the author's fidelity, then he's the one who created the situation. The author acted based on the information she had. It's unfair for him to get angry when she followed through on his initial instructions, which were to be just friends and not a couple. The real issue here is the ex's lack of transparency and honesty. His test was a form of emotional manipulation, which is his fault. The author isn't obligated to stay loyal to someone who's not being truthful about their intentions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex's actions and lack of clear communication led to the situation. The author had every right to move on after what she believed was a genuine breakup. The ex's anger is misplaced because he created the scenario through his test. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
