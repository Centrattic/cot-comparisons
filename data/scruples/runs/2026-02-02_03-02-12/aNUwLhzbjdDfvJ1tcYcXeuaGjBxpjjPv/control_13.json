TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy broke up with her, she thought they were over, and then she started seeing other people. The guy later said the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay loyal, and now he's mad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author thought they were broken up, so she moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. She did this to boost her self-esteem, which makes sense after a breakup. But the guy later admitted he never really broke up with her; it was a test.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong. If they were still technically in a relationship, then sleeping with others would be cheating. But the problem is the guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. He said he wanted to be friends, which the author took as a breakup. \n\nSo, the guy's actions might be at fault for not being clear. He used a breakup as a test, which is manipulative. The author acted based on what he told her. She didn't know it was a test. Cheating usually involves being in a committed relationship, but if the guy said it was over, then she's not cheating. However, if there was no actual breakup, then she is. \n\nBut here, the guy's actions are confusing. He broke up with her, leading her to believe it was over. Now he's upset because she moved on. His test was to see if she'd stay faithful, but by ending the relationship, even if it was a test, he set the stage for her to move on. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author did what she thought was right after a breakup. The problem lies with the guy's manipulation. He can't have it both ways: breaking up and then being upset when she dates others. The author isn't in the wrong because she followed his lead. The guy should have been honest from the start. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
