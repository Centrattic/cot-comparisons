TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was in a relationship with a guy who didn't express strong feelings but hinted at them. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually accepted it. To boost her self-esteem, she started using Tinder and had sex with others, believing they weren't a couple anymore. She's still in love with him. Later, she mentioned sleeping with others, and he blocked her. His friend revealed that the breakup was a test because he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. Now he's angry and refuses to talk to her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. The guy broke up with her, and she thought they were no longer a couple. After the breakup, she started seeing others, which she felt was okay because they weren't together anymore. However, he later claims the breakup was a test, implying they were still in a relationship. \n\nBut here's the key point: if the breakup was genuine, then the author was justified in moving on. The problem is the guy's claim that it was a test. If he actually wanted to test her, that's deceitful because he didn't communicate his true feelings. However, from the author's perspective, she acted based on what he told her. She had no way of knowing it was a test unless he told her. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. In that case, sleeping with others isn't cheating because they weren't in a relationship anymore. The guy's anger stems from his own deception. He set up a scenario where he pretended to break up to test her, then got upset when she moved on. That seems unfair. \n\nBut some might argue that if the breakup was a test, then technically, the relationship wasn't truly over. However, the guy didn't clarify that to the author. He said they were just friends, which the author accepted. So, the responsibility lies with him for not being honest. The author acted based on the information given to her. \n\nIn most breakup scenarios, if one person initiates the breakup and the other moves on, it's not the moved-on person's fault. The deception here is on the guy's part. He used a breakup as a test, which is manipulative. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the breakup being real, and his anger is misplaced. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No).\n"
