TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel storyline from Friends, right? So the guy breaks up with the author, claiming they need to be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to boost her self-esteem, starts dating others via Tinder. Then, when she mentions sleeping with others, the guy gets angry and blocks her. Later, it turns out the guy's breakup was a test to see her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The key points here are the communication (or lack thereof) and the understanding of the relationship status. The guy said they should be just friends, and the author took that as a breakup. She didn't have any obligation to stay faithful if it was truly over. However, he later says it was a test, implying he never intended to end the relationship. \n\nThis is a gray area. If the relationship was officially over, then the author isn't in the wrong for moving on. But if the guy's \"breakup\" was a manipulative test without clear communication, then the fault lies more with him. The problem is that the guy didn't clarify the situation. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. She thought they were broken up, so sleeping with others isn't a betrayal. However, the guy felt wronged because he didn't actually end the relationship in his mind.\n\nBut in relationships, if one person says it's over, the other is generally expected to take that as final. The fact that he continued talking to her might have muddied the waters. However, the author's actions were reasonable given his initial statement. The real issue is his lack of honesty about the test. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the breakup being real. The guy's manipulation is the root problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
