TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate the same way. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. However, the guy later admitted the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful, and he's now angry because she slept with others. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The guy initiated the breakup, which is a significant point. If someone ends the relationship, the expectation is that the other person is free to move on. The author's actions were a response to the breakup, which was mutual but not consensual in terms of the guy's hidden intentions.\n\nThe guy's actions complicate things. By breaking up and then secretly testing her loyalty, he was being deceptive. He knew she was in love with him and used that to create a situation where she might be vulnerable. The author had no way of knowing the breakup was a test; she acted in good faith based on what he said. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, especially if one party is still emotionally attached. It's a common way people try to recover from a break up.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is consent and clarity in the breakup. If the guy had truly ended the relationship, there's no expectation of fidelity. The problem arises from his dishonesty. By pretending to break up to test her, he set up a scenario where her natural reaction (moving on) would lead to his anger. That seems manipulative. \n\nThe author's actions were a healthy response to a breakup. She was trying to rebuild her self-esteem and move past the relationship. The fact that the guy was still in love but didn't communicate that adds another layer. He could have addressed his feelings instead of using a breakup as a test. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are essential. The guy's lack of honesty and the author's lack of knowledge about his true intentions make this a complex situation. The author acted based on the information she had. Since the breakup was presented as final, her decision to date others was reasonable. The guy's anger stems from his own manipulative behavior, which is the real issue here.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed the breakup as communicated to her. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being truthful about his intentions.\n"
