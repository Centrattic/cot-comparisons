TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. But then she found out that the break-up was actually a test because he was still in love with her and wanted to see how she'd react. Now he's angry because she slept with others when they weren't together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy said they were breaking up and wanted to be friends. She thought the relationship was over, so she dated others. But he didn't actually end things; he was testing her. The key point here is whether the break-up was genuine or not. If the guy never actually ended the relationship, then maybe she was still in a committed relationship and sleeping with others would be cheating. However, if he truly broke up with her, then she's not in a relationship anymore and her actions are her own.\n\nBut the problem is that the guy intended it as a test, which is deceptive. He led her to believe they were broken up, which she accepted, and then later revealed his test. His actions were manipulative. So, from her perspective, she acted based on the information she had at the time. She wasn't aware he was still considering them in a relationship. Therefore, she didn't know she was supposed to stay loyal. However, if they were in a monogamous relationship and he never clarified that the break-up wasn't real, then she might have a right to feel wronged. But the guy's deception complicates things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the guy is at fault for lying and testing her without being honest. The author acted on the assumption that they were no longer a couple. So, is she in the wrong for sleeping with others after a break-up? If they were truly broken up, then no, she's not cheating. But if the break-up was a test and they were still in a relationship, then yes, she cheated. However, since the guy didn't communicate his intentions, it's unclear. The main issue is the guy's dishonesty. The author might not be in the wrong because she didn't know the truth. But some might argue that she should have confirmed if the break-up was real before moving on. But in most break-up scenarios, if someone says they want to be friends, the other person is free to date. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted based on the information she had, and the guy's deception makes him responsible for the situation.\n"
