TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me parse through the details.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a guy who didn't express the same level of love but hinted at it. Then he broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on. To boost her self-esteem, she used Tinder and slept with others, assuming they were no longer a couple. Now, the guy says the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful, and he's angry that she moved on.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the definition of a breakup and consent. If he said they were just friends and ended the relationship, then from her perspective, it's over. In that case, she's not in the wrong for moving on. But he later claimed it wasn't a real breakup, which complicates things. However, the responsibility is on him to communicate clearly. If he broke up with her without clarifying that it's a test, she's justified in moving on. Plus, using a breakup as a test is manipulative and not healthy. The author's actions were in response to what she believed was the end of the relationship, so she's not at fault. Answer B.\n"
