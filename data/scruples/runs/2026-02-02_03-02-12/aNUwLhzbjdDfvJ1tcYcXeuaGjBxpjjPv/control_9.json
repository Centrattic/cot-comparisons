TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is at fault here. The situation is that the author thought they were broken up, so they started seeing other people to boost their self-esteem. The guy later said the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay loyal, and now he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship. After the breakup, they moved on by sleeping with others, which they felt was acceptable since they weren't together. The guy later revealed that the breakup was a test, and he was still in love. He's upset because he didn't expect them to move on.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and communication. When a breakup happens, both parties typically agree to end the relationship. If one person is testing the other's loyalty without clear communication, that's a problem. The author acted based on the belief that they were no longer in a relationship, so their actions might be justified. However, the guy's test is manipulative. He set up a situation where he broke up, but actually wanted to see the author's reaction, which is deceptive.\n\nIn terms of fault, if the breakup was genuine, then the author isn't in the wrong for moving on. But since the guy later admitted it was a test, he's the one who manipulated the situation. The author had no way of knowing his true intentions. Moving on after a breakup is normal, especially when dealing with self-esteem issues. The guy's anger stems from his own deception, not the author's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies with the other person for manipulating the breakup as a test without clear communication.\n"
