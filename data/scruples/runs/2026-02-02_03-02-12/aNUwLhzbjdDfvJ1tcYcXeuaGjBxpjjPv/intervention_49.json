TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is that the OP was in a relationship where the other person ended it, claiming they wanted to be friends. The OP then moved on, used Tinder, and slept with others. The ex then revealed he broke up as a test and is now upset about the OP's actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The OP believed they were no longer in a relationship after the breakup. They were told to be friends, so they assumed no exclusivity. The ex later admitted the breakup was a test, implying he never actually ended the relationship in his eyes. But from the OP's perspective, they followed through with the breakup as presented.\n\nFidelity in a relationship is typically expected when you're in a committed partnership. However, if the relationship has ended, the expectation of exclusivity might not apply. The OP's actions were based on the belief that they were no longer together. The ex's actions of breaking up as a test are manipulative, but that complicates things. The OP isn't responsible for the ex's dishonesty. The ex set the scenario by not being clear about his intentions and then getting upset when the OP acted accordingly.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? If they honestly believed they were no longer in a relationship, then their actions might be justifiable. However, some might argue that even after a breakup, there's an emotional expectation of not immediately moving on, especially if the ex was using the breakup as a test. But the key point is consent and communication. The ex didn't communicate his test properly, so the OP can't be blamed for acting in good faith based on the information given.\n\nAnother angle: If someone breaks up with you and you're no longer in a relationship, moving on is normal. The ex's test is a red flag, but the OP isn't at fault for taking the breakup at face value. The responsibility lies more with the ex for being deceptive. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
