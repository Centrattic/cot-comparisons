TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they were in a relationship, then the guy broke up with them but wanted to be friends. After the breakup, the author started dating others and sleeping with people on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. Then they mentioned this to the ex, who got angry and blocked them. The ex later said the breakup was a test, and he was still in love, but he's mad that the author slept with others.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. Let's break down the key points. The ex claimed the breakup was a test, but the author thought it was real. They were in a relationship, then it ended, and the author moved on. The ex's actions here are a bit shady because he didn't communicate clearly. If the breakup was a test, that's manipulative. But the author believed it was over, so they acted accordingly. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't necessarily wrong if the relationship is truly over. The ex's anger might be because he didn't want the author to move on, but that's his issue. The author isn't obligated to stay celibate after a breakup unless there were specific agreements. However, the ex's test is a red flag. The author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over, so they aren't in the wrong here. The main problem is the ex's manipulation. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
