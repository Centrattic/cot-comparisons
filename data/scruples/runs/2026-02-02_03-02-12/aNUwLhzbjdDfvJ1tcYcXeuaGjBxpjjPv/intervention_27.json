TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author, thinking they were over, started seeing others and now the guy is upset.\n\nFirst, the author believed they were in a breakup. The guy said they should be friends, and the author accepted that. The key here is the communication. If the guy didn't clearly state that it was a test and the author had no reason to doubt their breakup, then the author isn't at fault. Cheating is typically about being unfaithful when in a committed relationship. Since the author thought they were no longer a couple, sleeping with others isn't cheating from their perspective.\n\nHowever, the guy's friend revealed that the breakup was a test. But if he didn't communicate this to the author, then the author had no way of knowing. The responsibility lies with the guy to be clear about his intentions. The author acted based on the information given to them. The guy's anger stems from the author not knowing about the hidden test, which isn't the author's fault. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
