TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, claiming it was better to be friends. The author then moved on by sleeping with others on Tinder. Now the ex is angry because he says the breakup was a test and he's still in love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. When someone is in a relationship, they have certain expectations about exclusivity. If the partner ends the relationship, even if it's a test, the ex is still supposed to respect the other person's decisions once it's over. The author thought the breakup was real, so they acted accordingly. Cheating, but in this case, the author wasn't cheating because they were no longer in a relationship. The ex's test is questionable because he didn't communicate his true intentions. The author had every right to move on, especially after being told it was over. The ex's anger seems hypocritical, as he manipulated the situation without being honest. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
