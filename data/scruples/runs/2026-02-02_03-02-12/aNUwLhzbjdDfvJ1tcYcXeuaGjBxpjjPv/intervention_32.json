TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-partner broke up with them, and during the breakup, it was clear they should just be friends. The author then started dating others on Tinder to boost their self-esteem and move on. However, the ex later revealed the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. The ex is now upset that the author slept with others after they broke up.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the initial breakup terms. The guy said it was better to be friends, and the author believed they were no longer in a relationship. So, from the author's perspective, there was no ongoing relationship, hence no infidelity. The issue arises because the guy's real intention was to test the author's loyalty, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nBut fidelity is typically expected within a committed relationship. Once the relationship is over, unless there are specific agreements made (like waiting periods for dates after a breakup), the author isn't bound by those rules. The ex's anger seems to stem from the assumption that the breakup wasn't final, which is his own fault for using a test. The author acted based on the information given at the time.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have waited to see if the ex would come back, but that's placing an expectation on the author to stay celibate after a breakup, which isn't universally expected. The ex's manipulation complicates things, but the author's actions were based on what they believed was the truth.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on the breakup being final as communicated. The ex's test is a red flag, but the author's actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\n"
