TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario, which I remember from Friends. In that show, Ross and Rachel have a complicated on-again-off-again relationship, with Ross breaking up with Rachel and then being upset when she dates someone else. But this is a real-life situation, so I need to analyze it based on real-life morals.\n\nThe author was in a relationship with a guy. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but accepted it. Then, to boost her self-esteem, she started dating others through Tinder and slept with them. She thought it was okay because they were no longer in a relationship. But then the guy said the breakup was a test, and he was still in love with her. He's now angry and blocked her. \n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The guy ended the relationship, initiating the breakup.\n2. The author moved on by dating others after the breakup, which is a common way people deal with heartbreak.\n3. The guy later claims the breakup was a test and was still in love with her, but didn't communicate that clearly at the time.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup. In most ethical frameworks, when a relationship is ended by one party, the other is free to move on. The author had no obligation to stay single because the relationship was over. The guy's decision to break up and then later claim it was a test seems manipulative and unclear. If he was still in love but ended the relationship to test her, that's being dishonest. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the breakup wasn't clear or there were lingering feelings, the author might have been in a gray area. But the guy clearly said they should be friends, and the author acted on his initial decision. It's the guy's fault for not being honest about his feelings and intentions. The author wasn't in a relationship anymore when she started dating others, so she wasn't cheating. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
