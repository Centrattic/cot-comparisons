TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author thought their relationship had ended when the guy said they should just be friends. The guy was adamant about being friends only, and the author took that as a breakup. Then, to boost their self-esteem, the author used Tinder and slept with others. Now, the guy has revealed that the breakup was actually a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and he's angry about them sleeping with others even though they weren't officially a couple anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of a breakup. If someone says they want to be friends only and the other person agrees, that typically ends the romantic relationship. So the author probably thought they were no longer in a relationship. In that case, moving on and seeing other people isn't cheating because the relationship was supposed to be over. However, the guy's friend says he was testing her loyalty. But if the breakup was real, then the author isn't obligated to stay faithful. \n\nBut here's the twist: the guy didn't actually break up, he just used it as a test. If that's the case, maybe the author wasn't supposed to take the breakup seriously. However, from the author's perspective, he was clear about wanting to be friends, so they had no reason to believe he didn't mean it. The problem arises from the guy's deception. The author acted in good faith based on his initial statement. So the guy might be at fault for not being clear and testing her loyalty without her knowing. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have known better than to move on so quickly. However, after a breakup, it's common for people to seek emotional healing by dating others. The author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. The guy's anger stems from his hidden agenda, not from the author acting appropriately after a breakup. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they responded to what they believed was an actual breakup. The real issue is the guy's manipulation and lack of clarity about his intentions. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
