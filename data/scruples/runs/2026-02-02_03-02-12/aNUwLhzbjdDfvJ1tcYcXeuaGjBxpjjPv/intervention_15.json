TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, sleeping with others, and the ex using a test to see their reaction.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author was in a committed relationship when they slept with new people. The guy initially broke up and said they should be friends, which the author accepted. The author believed they were single and thus free to date others. In most relationships, fidelity is expected during the relationship, but if the relationship is over, sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, there's ambiguity here because the guy later claims the breakup was a test, implying he never intended to end the relationship. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, they were acting on the belief that they were no longer in a relationship. The guy's friend clarifies that the breakup was a test, but the author had no way of knowing that at the time. The guy's actions were deceptive\u2014using a breakup as a test without clear communication. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, infidelity is typically a no-no, but in this case, the author didn't know the relationship was still active. The guy's fault is in manipulating the situation without transparency. The author acted based on the information they had, which was that the relationship was over. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they made a judgment based on the breakup and their self-esteem issues. The guy's anger stems from a lack of communication and perhaps double standards. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
