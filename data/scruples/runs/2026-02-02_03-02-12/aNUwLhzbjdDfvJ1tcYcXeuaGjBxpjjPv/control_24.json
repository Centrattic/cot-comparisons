TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is a bit like the Ross and Rachel scenario, which I know from Friends, where Ross breaks up with Rachel and then later says it was a mistake. \n\nSo the author was in a relationship where the guy said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts dating others on Tinder to boost self-esteem. Then the guy later claims the breakup was a test, and he's upset she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy initially said it was over and they should be friends. The author, believing it was a breakup, started seeing others. If the guy didn't actually end the relationship but was testing her, then technically the author wasn't cheating because they were still technically in a relationship. But the problem is that the guy later admitted the breakup was a test, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nBut wait, if he said it was over, then the author had no way of knowing it wasn't. So from her perspective, she was following his lead. When someone ends a relationship, even if it's a test, the other person has a right to move on. Also, emotional infidelity is different from physical, but the guy is upset about the physical part. \n\nHowever, if the guy never actually ended the relationship, then maybe the author was in the wrong for moving on while they were still technically together. But the guy's part in this is also questionable because he didn't communicate that it wasn't really a breakup. \n\nBut according to the information given, the guy did say they should be friends, which is a definitive breakup statement. The author acted on that, so she might not be in the wrong. The guy's actions are the issue here for making it a test without clarifying. \n\nSo, in terms of the question, is the author (TA) in the wrong? If the breakup was real, then no, she's not wrong. But if he didn't actually end it, then yes. Since he said he ended it, and later admitted it was a test, the problem lies with him for not being honest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she believed the relationship was over.\n"
