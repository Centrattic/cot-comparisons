TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, the author sleeping with others, and the ex claiming it was a test.\n\nFirst, the guy said they were just friends after the breakup. The author thought it was over and started dating others on Tinder. The key point here is whether the breakup was genuine or not. The ex later says it was a test, which complicates things. \n\nIf the guy actually intended for it to be a breakup and then changed his mind, but never communicated that clearly, it's his fault for being unclear. On the other hand, if the author made assumptions based on his initial statement, maybe she's not at fault. \n\nBut wait, he was adamant about being friends, so she had reason to believe the relationship was over. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong if they're not exclusive. However, if the guy's test was to see if she'd stay faithful, that's a red flag on his part. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the information she had at the time. The ex's \"test\" is manipulative because he never clarified his intentions. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
