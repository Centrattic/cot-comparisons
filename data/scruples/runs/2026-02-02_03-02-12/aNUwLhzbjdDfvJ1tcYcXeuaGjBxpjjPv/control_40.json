TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, they were supposed to be just friends. She got on Tinder and slept with others to boost her self-esteem. Then he found out and got angry, saying the breakup was a test. Now the question is whether she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy ended the relationship and said they should be friends. The author thought they were no longer an item, so she moved on by dating others. But he later claims the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful, which is pretty weird. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she believed they were broken up. Once a relationship ends, it's generally expected that both parties are free to date others. So if he broke up with her, she's not in a committed relationship anymore. Her actions were based on that belief. \n\nBut there's a problem here. The guy was testing her, which is manipulative. He didn't communicate his intentions clearly. By ending the relationship, he gave her the impression they were not together anymore. If he wanted her to stay exclusive, he should have made that clear. However, from the author's point of view, she had no way of knowing it was a test. She acted based on the information she had, which was that they were no longer in a relationship.\n\nThe key issue is consent and communication. The guy didn't set boundaries or explain that the break-up was conditional. The author wasn't cheating because they weren't in a relationship when she started seeing others. Cheating typically involves being in a committed relationship and violating that commitment. Since he said they were just friends, she had no obligation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if he still had feelings and considered himself in a de facto relationship, maybe she was in the wrong. But in reality, once a person ends the relationship, unless there's a mutual agreement to stay exclusive, the other person is free to move on. The guy's actions were deceptive by using a test, which is manipulative. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on his stated decision to break up. The guy's anger stems from his own manipulative behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
