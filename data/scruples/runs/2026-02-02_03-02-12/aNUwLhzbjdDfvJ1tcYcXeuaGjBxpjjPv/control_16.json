TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate the same level of feelings. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to accept it. To boost her self-esteem, she used Tinder and had sex with others, thinking they were no longer a couple. Then, when she mentioned this to him, he blocked her and later revealed that the breakup was a test because he was still in love with her. Now he's angry.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the breakup and whether it was genuine. If the guy broke up with her, then technically, they were no longer in a relationship. So, if she's not in a relationship anymore, sleeping with others isn't cheating. But the twist is that he was using the breakup as a test. That complicates things because he didn't actually end the relationship; he was just testing her loyalty. So, she didn't know that. \n\nFrom her perspective, she thought they were broken up. So acting on that assumption, she's not in the wrong. But from his side, he considered the breakup a test, meaning he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. However, he didn't communicate this clearly. He told her they should be friends, which is a breakup. So he's the one who didn't clarify his intentions. \n\nThe problem here is his deception. If he was testing her, that's a manipulative approach. The author acted based on the information she had. She had no way of knowing it was a test unless he told her. So she's not at fault for trusting his initial breakup decision. \n\nBut some might argue that maybe she should have realized it was a test. But that's hindsight. People do break up for various reasons, and it's not her responsibility to question every breakup as a test. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed the breakup as communicated. The issue lies with him for not being honest about his intentions.\n"
