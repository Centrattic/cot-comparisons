TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit like the Ross and Rachel scenario, which is a common example in these kinds of debates. \n\nSo, the author was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but the guy never reciprocated the same level of feelings. He then decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but tried to move on. To boost their self-esteem, they used Tinder and slept with others. The key point here is that the author believed they were no longer in a relationship.\n\nNow, the twist comes when the guy says the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. He was still in love and wanted to see if they'd be faithful if he wasn't around. When he found out they slept with others, he got angry and blocked them.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to sleep with other people after a breakup. But there's a problem here: was it actually a breakup? The guy claims it was a test, but the author didn't know that. The author acted based on the belief that the relationship had ended, which the guy led them to believe. \n\nIn relationships, fidelity is typically expected as long as both parties consider themselves in a committed relationship. However, if one person unilaterally decides to continue a test or maintain some form of relationship without clear communication, that could be problematic. The author made a decision based on the information they had at the time, which was that the relationship was over. They didn't have any indication that the guy was still in love and that the breakup was just a test.\n\nThe guy's actions here are questionable because he didn't communicate his true intentions. He led the author to believe the relationship was over, then later claimed it wasn't. That's a form of deception. The author, acting on the belief they were single, made choices they thought were appropriate. \n\nTherefore, it's more the guy's fault for not being honest. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup they were told about. They had no way of knowing it was a test. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
