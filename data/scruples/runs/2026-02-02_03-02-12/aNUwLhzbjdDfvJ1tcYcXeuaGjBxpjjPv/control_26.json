TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship where they were deeply in love with their partner. The guy broke up with them, saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but eventually started seeing other people on Tinder as a way to boost their self-esteem. They thought it was okay because they weren't in a relationship anymore. Now, the guy claims the breakup was a test to see how the author would react, and he's angry that she slept with others. He blocked her after finding out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the breakup. The guy said it was a breakup, so the author reasonably assumed they were not in a relationship anymore. The key point here is whether the breakup was genuine or a test. The author had no way of knowing it was a test, so acting based on the breakup being real seems valid. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, after a breakup, moving on by dating others is common. The problem arises because the guy later says it was a test. But tests like that are ethically questionable because they deceive the other person. The author didn't know they were still in the relationship, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. \n\nHowever, the guy's actions\u2014pretending to break up to test fidelity\u2014might be manipulative. But the question is about the author's responsibility. Since the author acted on the information given (a breakup), they aren't in the wrong for moving on. The issue is more on the guy for setting up a deceptive test. \n\nOn the other hand, if the breakup wasn't final and the guy still considered them in a relationship, then the author might be in the wrong. But since he explicitly said they were broken up, it's reasonable for the author to proceed. The guy's test is more of a red flag in the relationship, but the author isn't at fault here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
