TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then started dating others on Tinder, thinking the relationship was over. Later, they found out that the break up was actually a test, and the guy was still in love and wanted to see how the author would react. Now he's angry because she slept with others while they were supposedly broken up.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about the nature of the breakup. If the author believed the relationship was over, then sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, right? Because once you're not in a relationship, you're free to date. But the twist here is that the guy didn't actually break up; he was testing. So did the author make a mistake in assuming the breakup was real?\n\nBut wait, how should she know it was a test? The guy said it was over and wanted to be friends. From her perspective, it was a breakup. She acted accordingly. The problem arises because he didn't actually end the relationship but wanted to see her reaction. However, from her side, she took his words as a real breakup. \n\nIn most relationships, if one person says they want to be friends and ends the relationship, the other person is entitled to move on. So if she took it as a breakup, she's not wrong for starting to date again. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he never actually ended the relationship in a way that was clear. He was testing her, which is a bit manipulative, really. So the fault might lie more with him for not being honest about his intentions. \n\nBut some might argue that she shouldn't have moved on so quickly, but that's more about personal boundaries. Since he was still in love and wanted to test her, but presented it as a breakup, she had no reason to know. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
