I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sleeping with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The key points here are consent, knowledge, and the consequences of exposing the cheater.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed not to out the man when he confessed he was gay and closeted. They had a relationship knowing this, but the author didn't realize he was married and having kids. So, the author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. That's a big factor. The man was already cheating, which is wrong, but the author wasn't aware of the marital status at the time. \n\nNow, when the author finds out he's married, they feel guilty because they've been cheated on before and understand the pain. The dilemma is whether to tell the wife, which would out him. The author is considering exposing the cheating spouse but is conflicted about outing him because of his family's potential reaction.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The man is the one who cheated, lied about his marital status, and is in a closeted situation. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the relationship. The author is now trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it might out the man. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, even if it leads to outing him. \n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The author's actions are driven by a sense of obligation to the wife, who has a right to know about the infidelity. However, outing someone without their consent can be seen as violating their privacy. But in this case, the author is trying to expose a cheating spouse, which is a separate issue. The key is whether the author should prioritize the wife's right to know over the man's desire to stay closeted. \n\nSince the man was already lying (about his marital status and orientation), the author's intention to inform the wife isn't necessarily wrong. The man's actions were deceptive, and the author is trying to correct that by revealing the truth. However, outing him could have severe consequences for him. But ethically, the wife has been wronged, and the author isn't directly responsible for the affair. The author's mistake might be not verifying his marital status earlier, but that's not entirely their fault. The main issue is the cheater's deception. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the infidelity even if it out him. Since the author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair, and the cheater was already in the wrong, the author's intent to inform the wife isn't malicious. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
