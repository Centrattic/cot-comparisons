I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. So the situation is that the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They found out he's cheating on his wife, and now the author is conflicted between not outing him and telling the wife.\n\nFirst, the author has to balance two ethical issues: the right to privacy (the man's sexuality) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. On one side, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a big deal, especially if their family might not accept it. On the other side, the wife is being cheated on, which is a serious betrayal.\n\nThe author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. The man was in the closet, so his actions were deceptive. The author is now in a bind because telling the wife would reveal his sexuality, which he hasn't come out about. But keeping quiet might let the wife continue being cheated on.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they had consensual relationships, but the man was married. The author might feel guilty about contributing to the infidelity, but the main issue now is whether exposing him is wrong. If the author tells the wife, they're protecting her but outing him. If they don't, they're letting the wife be unaware of the cheating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling the wife. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the duty to the wife might be stronger because she's being harmed. However, outing someone without their consent is a violation of privacy. But the man was already cheating, which is a betrayal. The author is in a tough spot. Legally, in many places, cheating isn't a crime, so there's no legal obligation to report it. Morally, it's a tough call. The author isn't the one who committed the adultery, so they might feel responsible to act because they know about it. But they also have to consider the consequences for the man's family and his personal privacy.\n\nIn some views, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, as the cheater's actions are the root problem. But if the author's action of telling the wife outed him, that could have lasting negative effects. Maybe there's a middle ground, like suggesting he seek counseling or talk to the wife himself. But the author might feel responsible since they were part of the affair.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to correct a wrong (cheating) but is conflicted about the means (outing). Since the man made choices to deceive both his wife and the author, the author's intent to inform the wife could be seen as morally justified, even if it has unintended consequences for the man's privacy.\n"
