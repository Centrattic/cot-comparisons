I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a series of affairs with a married man, who is also gay and closeted. The man was at the wedding as an usher, and they met there. The author didn't know he was married, only found out later. Now they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the cheating, but doing so would out him as gay. The author is questioning if they'd be in the wrong (WIBTA) for exposing the cheater, even if it means outing him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral aspects here. The man is cheating, which is clearly wrong. The author is involved in an affair, which is also ethically questionable. But the author is now considering exposing the man to his wife, which would reveal his infidelity but also his sexuality, potentially causing family issues because his parents are traditional.\n\nThe author is in a dilemma between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality. On one hand, the wife deserves to know about the betrayal. On the other, outing someone without their consent is a big deal, especially if they're closeted. The author also mentions that the man's parents might react poorly to his being gay, adding another layer of potential harm.\n\nBut wait, the author was in an affair with a married man. That's not a good position to be in. The author might have some responsibility here for entering into a relationship with someone they knew was married? Wait, no\u2014they didn't know he was married when they started the affair. The author found out later. So the affair started without knowledge of his marriage. However, the author still continued the relationship after finding out. Also, the man is using Grindr, which might suggest he's cheating on his wife with others as well. The author's own actions are part of the problem here.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing him to his wife. But does the author have the right to do that? The author is not a party to the marriage, so they might be overstepping by interfering. The wife has a right to know, but the author isn't in a position to decide to expose someone else's partner. Additionally, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is generally seen as a violation of privacy, even if the intent is to expose infidelity.\n\nSo, the author's actions in exposing the cheater could be seen as wrong because they are meddling in someone else's marriage and violating the man's privacy. Even if the intention is to help the wife, the author isn't the one to make that decision. Also, the author is partly responsible for the affair, which complicates their moral standing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for planning to expose him, especially since it involves outing him against his wishes. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
