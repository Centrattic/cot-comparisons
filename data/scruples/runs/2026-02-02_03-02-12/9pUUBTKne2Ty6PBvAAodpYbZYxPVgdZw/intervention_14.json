I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for possibly exposing a cheater by outing him. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the cheating, even if it means revealing his sexuality to the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The man is cheating on his wife, which is a serious betrayal. The author is in a relationship with him, so that's an affair too. The main dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (since he's closeted) and informing his wife about the infidelity. \n\nThe author argues that they shouldn't out him because his parents might not handle it well. But the wife has a right to know that her husband is cheating. However, the act of informing the wife would also out him, which could have significant consequences for him and his family. \n\nI should think about the author's responsibility. If the author is complicit in the cheating by continuing the relationship, they might be part of the problem. But the key issue is whether they have a duty to inform the wife. On one hand, cheating is a major issue, and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially in a conservative family setting. \n\nIs there a way to tell the wife without outing him? Maybe, but the author might not have that information. The man's being gay isn't directly related to the cheating unless the wife is unaware of his sexuality. If the author tells the wife that her husband is cheating, the wife might figure out his sexuality on her own, especially if he has a Grindr account. However, the author's disclosure could be the catalyst for that revelation. \n\nSo, the author's rightness depends on the balance between the harm of cheating and the harm of outing. The man is in a difficult position, being closeted and having kids. The author might feel guilt from their own actions, but the moral obligation to the wronged wife is also strong. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, deceiving someone (cheating) is considered wrong, and informing a spouse about infidelity is often seen as a moral duty. However, outing someone without consent is also a violation of privacy. The author's position is tricky because they were in a relationship with the cheater, making them an active participant. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as cheating is a serious matter. But they should consider the potential consequences of outing him. However, since the affair is ongoing and the man is using the closet to hide his bisexuality, the author might have a responsibility to the wife. The answer is probably B (No), but I need to be careful. The author's own actions (affair) could be a point against them, but the main issue is the disclosure. So, B makes sense here.\n"
