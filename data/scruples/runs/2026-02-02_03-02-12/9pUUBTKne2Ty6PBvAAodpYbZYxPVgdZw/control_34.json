I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the scenario is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old married man who's in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, who's out of the country, and the person now wants to expose him by telling his wife, which would also out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed not to tell anyone, respecting the man's privacy. But after finding out he's married, they feel conflicted between helping the wife know about the cheating and not outing the man. The key points here are consent, privacy, and the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship, so maybe they were complicit in the cheating. But since the man was already in a marriage and cheating, he's the one who broke his vows. The author's dilemma is whether to inform the wife, risking the man's privacy and family dynamics, or stay silent.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but the wife has a right to know. However, the author isn't obligated to act as a whistleblower. The ethical issue is whether the author has the right to expose the man's infidelity and his sexuality. Outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the man's family is not accepting of his sexuality. The author might be causing more harm by outing him, even if the intention is to help the wife.\n\nBut the man is the one who was dishonest. The author could try to find a way to inform the wife without revealing the man's sexuality, but if the only evidence is through the author's relationship with him, it might be hard. The author is in a tough spot because they care about the man's well-being but also believe the wife deserves the truth.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they decide to expose the man, they're breaching his privacy, which could be wrong. But if they don't, they're letting the wife be deceived. However, the author wasn't the one who committed the infidelity. The main wrongdoer is the man. The author's actions here are a moral choice, not necessarily a legal one. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a complex situation. If they choose to tell the wife, they might be acting in the wife's interest, but it's still a breach of privacy and could out the man. The answer depends on whether the act of informing the wife (and thus outing him) is justified. Since the author didn't know the man was married at first, their initial actions were part of the cheating, but the decision to expose him now is another layer. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the man was the one who cheated and lied, and the author is trying to do the right thing despite the complications.\n"
