I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher, who is married with two kids, asked the author not to tell anyone because he's gay and in the closet. The author respected that and kept it a secret. They continued to have a relationship multiple times. Then the author found out the usher is married and cheating. The author confronts him, and the usher is conflicted about leaving his wife due to the kids. Now, the author is torn between not outing the usher (due to his family's potential reaction) and informing the wife about the cheating, which would out the usher.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author had a consensual relationship with someone who was married. The usher is cheating on his wife. The author is considering exposing the infidelity, which would also out him as gay. The author is worried about the repercussions on the usher's family and his own guilt from past experiences.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author did have a consensual relationship with the usher. Since both parties were adults, that's not necessarily wrong unless there's non-consent or other factors. But the usher was married, so the author was involved with someone who's in a committed relationship. That's cheating, but the author wasn't aware of the marriage initially. Wait, the author says \"if I'd known any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him.\" So the author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. The usher didn't disclose his marital status, which is a big deal. So the author was deceived. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is wrong to consider exposing the infidelity. The author is in a moral dilemma: the wife has a right to know, but outing the usher (as gay) could cause family issues. The author is considering whether to inform the wife, which would mean outing the usher. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater? Well, the author was in a relationship with the cheater without knowing he was married. The author was a victim of deception. The author's intentions in exposing the infidelity are to inform the wife of her husband's actions, which is understandable. However, doing so would out the usher as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is trying to balance two wrongs: the husband's infidelity and the potential harm of outing someone.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for wanting to do this? If the author is the one who had the affair without knowing, maybe there's some responsibility there. But since the usher was already married and in a relationship, he's the one who's cheating. The author was misled. \n\nThe author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, which is a difficult decision. However, the act of outing someone without their consent can have serious consequences. But the author is trying to inform the wife, which could be seen as a noble cause. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The usher did. The author is trying to take responsibility by informing the wife, which might be the right thing to do. However, there's a potential for causing additional harm by outing the usher. But the author is considering that and trying to find a way to inform the wife without outing him, which shows some consideration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be B (No), because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife about the infidelity, even though it's a tough situation. But there's a nuance here. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The act of sleeping with a married man was a mistake, but the author didn't know. The author's main issue is whether to expose the cheater, which is a moral dilemma. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even though it's a tough decision. The wrong would be with the usher for cheating and not disclosing his marital status. The author is trying to correct the wrong by informing the wife.\n"
