I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a complex set of actions and moral dilemmas. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a man who's married and in the closet. The man, who works as an usher, asked the author not to out him, and the author agreed. They had multiple encounters, and later found out that the man is married with two kids. The author feels guilty because he was cheated on before and wants to do the right thing by informing the wife. However, doing so would out the man, which could have serious consequences for him, especially with his conservative parents. The central question is whether the author is in the wrong if he decides to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a consensual relationship with someone who is married and in the closet. The author is now considering revealing the infidelity to the wife, which would also come out the man's sexuality. The author is torn between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the potential harm of outing the man against his wishes.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. The man is in a committed marriage, and having an affair is a breach of trust. The author, while not in a relationship with the man, had consensual encounters. However, the author is now faced with the dilemma of whether to inform the wife, which would protect her from being cheated on but also out the man, which he had previously agreed not to do.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions: Initially, the author kept the man's secret about being gay, respecting his privacy. However, the author now wants to report the infidelity, which involves the man's other secret (the affair) and his sexuality. The problem is that the author is not the man's partner, so the responsibility to inform the wife isn't clear. The author might argue that the wife has a right to know, but the author isn't in a position to act as a whistleblower without consequences. Additionally, outing the man against his wishes could be considered a violation of trust, even if it's to expose the cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as trying to do the right thing by stopping the ongoing infidelity, but the method involves outing someone, which complicates things. The man's closeted status and family situation add layers of potential harm. Outing him could lead to familial conflict, which the author is aware of and doesn't want to cause. However, by not informing the wife, the author might be complicit in the man's continued cheating.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's initial relationship with the man was consensual. Since both parties consented to the encounters, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for participating. However, the act of cheating is on the married man, not the author. The dilemma is whether the author should take it upon themselves to expose the man's actions, which involves breaking his confidentiality. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to inform the wife. The wife's partner is the one who has a duty to be honest. The author, as a third party, might not have the right to interfere unless there's a legal obligation (like in some jurisdictions, knowing about a spouse's infidelity and not reporting it could be a legal matter, but that's rare). Since this is a moral question, it's more about the author's personal ethics.\n\nIf the author decides to inform the wife, they might be justified in wanting to protect her, but the method of doing so by outing the man could be seen as harmful. Alternatively, the author could try to inform the wife without disclosing the man's sexuality, but the user mentions that the wife might not be the only other person involved (Grindr account), implying the man has multiple partners. If the author could find a way to inform the wife without outing him (e.g., through a third party or anonymously), that might be a middle ground. However, in this case, the author's relationship with the man and the circumstances might make anonymity difficult.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing by the wife, but the act of outing the man could be problematic. However, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the married man is. The author's involvement was consensual, so they aren't at fault for participating. The main issue is the potential exposure of the man's private information beyond the infidelity. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation where the author is trying to navigate conflicting moral obligations.\n"
