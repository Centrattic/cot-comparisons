I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sexual relationship with someone they found out is married and gay, and now they're conflicted about whether to expose the cheater without outing him.\n\nFirst, the author initially had a relationship with the married man, who is in the closet. The man asked them not to reveal his sexuality. The author respected that but later discovered he was cheating. Now they're considering telling the wife, which would out him. \n\nThe key issues here are: Is the author obligated to inform the wife about the infidelity? Is outing someone a problem here? Also, the author is concerned about family reactions if the man's parents find out. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is a serious breach of trust. The wife has a right to know if her husband is being unfaithful. However, the author's actions in the first place\u2014sleeping with a married man\u2014could be seen as contributing to the problem. The author might be in the wrong for engaging in the affair, which complicates their moral stance on exposing the cheater. \n\nBut the user's own perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong. The user might be focusing on the fact that the author is trying to do the right thing by considering informing the wife, despite the potential fallout. The dilemma is between two wrongs: cheating and outing someone. The author is stuck between two harms. \n\nHowever, there's also the question of consent and privacy. The author broke the man's trust by having a relationship with him while he was married and then considering exposing him. Even if the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, their initial actions were part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to correct a mistake, but their initial decision to engage in the affair is questionable. The answer hinges on whether the author's intent to right a wrong (cheating) justifies the means (outing someone). Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong for the affair but not necessarily for trying to inform the wife. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they are trying to address the harm they caused. But the act of sleeping with a married person is a problem. The user's own answer is B (not in the wrong), but maybe the correct answer is A (in the wrong) because the author's actions contributed to the situation. However, the user's perspective might prioritize the author's intent to do the right thing despite the complications.\n"
