I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Aiding) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher, who is married with two kids, told the author he's gay but in the closet and asked not to be outed. They hooked up multiple times. Then the author found out the usher is married and cheating. The author is conflicted: he wants to tell the wife but doesn't want to out the man because the man's parents are conservative and might not accept his sexuality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if he decides to expose the cheating, which would out the man.\n\nFirst, let's break down the moral issues here. The key points are:\n\n1. The author had a consensual relationship with the man, who was married. The man was cheating on his wife, which is unethical and potentially illegal if it's against the law where they are.\n2. The man asked the author not to out him as he's in the closet. The author initially agreed but is now considering exposing the cheating, which would reveal his sexuality.\n3. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible wrongdoings. The author's actions so far: sleeping with someone who was married without knowing about the marriage, which could be considered unethical, but he didn't know. However, after finding out, he's trying to decide whether to inform the wife. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially exposing the infidelity (which is a betrayal by the husband) even if it means outing him. The wife's right to know about the cheating versus the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexual orientation.\n\nIn many places, adultery isn't a legal matter, but it's a moral one. However, if the wife's children are involved, the situation becomes more complex. The author might feel a moral obligation to inform the wife because she has a right to know she's being cheated on, especially with multiple children involved. But outing someone against their wishes complicates things. The man's request for privacy must be weighed against the wife's potential harm.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife? Well, if the author is the sole person who knows about the infidelity and the wife has no other way to find out, then there's an argument that the author has a duty to inform her. However, the author is also bound by the confidentiality the man trusted him with. \n\nBut here's the catch: the man was deceptive. He didn't disclose his marital status or the fact that he was cheating. The author was deceived, which might shift some responsibility. If the author had known the man was married, he wouldn't have had the relationship. Now that he knows, he's trying to balance the wife's right to know with the man's right to privacy. \n\nHowever, by engaging in the relationship, the author might have contributed to the infidelity. But that's a different angle. The main question is whether he's wrong to expose the cheating, which would out the man. \n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, you might not have a legal obligation to inform the wife, but morally, it's a different story. The wife is being harmed by the infidelity. The man's request to stay in the closet is about his personal life, but the wife's harm is more direct. \n\nThe author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the man did. The author's role is as a person who was involved in the affair. So, if the author decides to inform the wife, is that in the wrong? Or is the author trying to do the right thing by preventing further harm to the wife? \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not the one who cheated. The man did. The author is trying to inform the wife, which is a moral duty, even if it means outing him. The man's request to not be outed is valid, but the wife's right to know about the betrayal is also significant. \n\nHowever, there's a potential for the author to find a way to inform the wife without outing the man. For example, maybe the wife can be told about the infidelity without revealing the author's identity or the man's sexuality. But the author mentions that the man has a Grindr account, suggesting he might have other affairs. That complicates things because it indicates the infidelity isn't a one-time thing. \n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it would be for outing the man without his consent. But if the author is doing it to prevent the wife from being further harmed, maybe that's not in the wrong. The ethical dilemma here is tough. \n\nIn many moral frameworks, the harm caused by keeping the secret (wife being cheated on) might outweigh the harm of outing someone. However, the author's initial involvement in the affair could be seen as complicity. But he didn't know the man was married. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing the man. However, the answer depends on the balance of harms. If there's a way to inform the wife without outing the man, that would be better. But if outing is the only way, then the duty to prevent harm to the wife might take precedence. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
