I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone they met at a wedding. They found out later he was married and had kids. They're conflicted between wanting to tell the wife and not outing him. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the guy is cheating, which is a serious issue. The wife has a right to know, right? But the author is also considering his privacy, since coming out as gay might not be safe for him given his family's possible reaction. \n\nBut wait, the guy is already cheating. He's in a committed relationship and having an affair. The author slept with him multiple times, but they didn't know about the marriage. Now, the author is in a dilemma. They want to tell the wife but don't want to out him. \n\nIs it their responsibility to inform the wife? The author might feel they need to do the right thing by the wife, but the method of doing so could involve outing him. But maybe there's a way to tell the wife without mentioning his sexuality, just that he cheated. However, if the author knows he's gay and in a secret relationship, maybe the wife would eventually find out other ways. \n\nBut the author was part of the affair. They might be complicit in the cheating. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for exposing it. The author isn't the one cheating; they were the other person. But they could be in the wrong for not considering the consequences of exposing him, given his closeted status. However, the wife's right to know is also important. \n\nThe author might be in a tough spot. They could be helping the wife by reporting the infidelity, but outing him against his wishes. But is the author morally obligated to do so? Or is the author overstepping by trying to protect him from his family?\n\nHmm. The answer might depend on perspectives. If the author chooses to inform the wife without outing him, that's better. But if they do it by outing him, maybe that's harmful. But the author might feel that the wife deserves to know the truth, even if it's painful. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing for the wife, but they need to find a way that respects his privacy. But if they end up outing him, maybe that's wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater if it means outing him. If there's a way to tell the wife without outing him, then the author isn't wrong for trying to do that. But if they choose to out him, that's a different story. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B, not wrong, but it's a bit ambiguous. But the user says they think the author isn't wrong. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
