I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old who had an affair with a married man, 23-year-old, who is gay but in the closet. The man asked the author not to reveal his sexuality, but the author is now considering exposing the affair to the man's wife because he cheated on her. The dilemma is whether outing the man is justified.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual sex with the man while knowing he was married. That's cheating, and the author is now conflicted about whether they should expose the man to his wife. The author's friend's sister is the wife, so there's a connection there. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, since cheating is wrong, but doing so would out the man, which he's not ready for.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating isn't illegal, so there's no legal obligation to report it. Ethically, the wife has the right to know about the infidelity. However, the man's privacy and safety regarding his sexuality are also important. Outing him could have serious consequences, especially given his family's potential reaction. The author is in a tough spot between protecting the wife's rights and respecting the man's privacy.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they were involved in an affair themselves. By sleeping with a married man, they contributed to the situation. However, their intention to inform the wife is about honesty, which is morally right. But outing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong. The author's actions could lead to harm to the man's family and personal life. There's a potential to find a middle ground, like involving authorities if there's a crime (like using Grindr for illegal activities), but if it's just cheating, the author's options are limited. \n\nThe author's main mistake was entering into an affair with a married person. However, considering the complexities of the man's closeted status and the possible family repercussions, the author is trying to balance conflicting ethical concerns. It's a tough call, but the act of cheating is the initial wrongdoing. However, the author's intent to correct that by informing the wife is commendable but comes at the cost of the man's privacy. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong because they're trying to right a wrong, but their initial involvement was problematic. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for possibly exposing the cheater, considering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
