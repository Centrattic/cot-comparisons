I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The situation involves a married man who cheated with the author and is in the closet. The author is conflicted between protecting his privacy and informing his wife about the infidelity.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with the husband, which they later found out was an affair. The husband is married, so the author is part of an extramarital affair. That's a red flag. The author might be in the wrong for entering into a relationship with a married man in the first place. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing him.\n\nThe husband is in the closet, so outing him could have serious consequences for him, especially with his family's reaction. The author is trying to balance the wife's right to know she's been cheated on versus the husband's privacy. The author might not have a legal or moral obligation to inform the wife unless they have a direct relationship. However, the author is aware they're not the only person he's cheated with, which complicates things.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they might be protecting the wife's rights and helping her make informed decisions. But outing the husband against his wishes could be seen as a violation of trust, especially since he asked them not to tell. There's no clear legal duty here, so it's more of an ethical dilemma.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as trying to mitigate harm. If they don't tell the wife, the wife remains unaware of the betrayal. If they do tell, they help the wife but out the husband. The author isn't legally in the wrong for either choice, but socially, there might be judgment either way. The key is whether the author has a responsibility to act here, which isn't clear-cut. The answer hinges on whether the author is justified in exposing the husband despite the consequences.\n"
