I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's also gay and in the closet. They slept together multiple times. The man didn't disclose his marriage or his sexuality initially. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the cheating, which would out him to his family who might not accept his sexuality.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for considering exposing the cheater? Let's break it down. The author was deceived. The man was married and had a secret sexuality. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. The author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it means outing him. \n\nOn one hand, the author had an affair with someone who was married. That's a problem. But they were kept in the dark about his marital status. The man was also hiding his sexuality, which adds another layer. The author is trying to protect the man's family from finding out about his sexuality, which could be harmful. \n\nIs the author at fault for the affair? Maybe partially, but they were misled. The main issue is whether exposing the cheater (and outing him) is justified. The author is in a dilemma between helping the wife and protecting the man's privacy. \n\nThe key points are intent and context. The author wants to do the right thing but is caught between two wrongs. They\u2019re not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, especially if they suspect he's cheated on her. However, the act of cheating itself complicates things. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering all factors.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they were deceived and are trying to make amends. They\u2019re not the one who broke the marriage vows. The man is, in fact, the cheater here. The author's intentions to inform the wife, despite the potential fallout, show a desire to do the right thing. So the answer is B.\n"
