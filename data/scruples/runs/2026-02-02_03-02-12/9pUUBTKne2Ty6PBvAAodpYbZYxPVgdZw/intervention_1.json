I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who had a relationship with a married man who is also in the closet. The author is considering exposing the cheating but is worried about outing him, which could cause family problems. They don't want to out him but feel the wife should know.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a relationship with someone who was married and not out as gay. The man asked the author not to out him. Now, the author is conflicted between protecting the man's privacy and informing the wife about the cheating. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong if they choose to tell the wife, even if it out the man.\n\nThe person in question is cheating on their wife, which is a betrayal. The author, while they had consensual relationships, is now considering exposing the cheating. The dilemma is about the duty to inform the wife versus respecting the man's wish to stay closeted. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between two moral obligations: the right of the wife to know she's being cheated on, and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author might feel a responsibility to the wife because cheating is a serious matter. However, outing someone without their consent can have severe consequences, especially if the family is not accepting of being gay.\n\nThe author did not know the man was married when they started the relationship. The man was in the closet and possibly using multiple relationships (Grindr account). The author feels guilty for being a cheater themselves but is trying to do the right thing by the wife. \n\nIs the author in the wrong if they tell the wife? If they do, they're exposing the cheating but also outing the man. The man's actions are wrong (cheating, lying to his wife), but the author is now mediating between these two parties. The author's intention is to inform the wife, but the method could involve outing. \n\nLegally, maybe there's no issue with the author informing the wife. Ethically, it's more complex. The author might be considered in the right for trying to uphold the wife's right to know about the infidelity, but they might be in the wrong for outing someone without consent. However, if the man is cheating, the author's actions could be seen as a moral duty to the wronged spouse. \n\nAlternatively, there's a possibility that the author could inform the wife without revealing the man's sexuality. But if the only way to inform her is to expose his sexuality, then the author is creating an ethical dilemma. The answer depends on whether the author can separate the two issues. If the cheating can be reported without outing, that might be preferable. But if not, the author is forced to choose between two wrongs. \n\nIn this case, the user says they think the author is not in the wrong. The options are A or B. Given that the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but is concerned about outing, it's a tough call. But if the author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife, even if it out the man, maybe they are not in the wrong. The man is the one who cheated, so the author's action is to rectify that wrong. However, the act of outing could be seen as another harm. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the main issue is the cheating, and the author is trying to inform the wife of her husband's infidelity, which is a valid concern. However, the method might involve outing, which complicates things. But in terms of right or wrong, the author's intention is to correct a wrong done by the man, so they are not in the wrong.\n"
