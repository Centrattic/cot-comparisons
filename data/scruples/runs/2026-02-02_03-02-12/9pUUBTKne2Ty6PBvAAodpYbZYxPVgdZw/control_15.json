I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (let's call them Person A) had a relationship with someone (Person B) they met at a wedding. Person B is married and has kids, and when Person A found out, they were upset because they've been cheated on before. Now Person A is trying to decide whether to tell Person B's wife (and thus out him) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to check if Person A is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. Person A was friends with Person B's family for a long time, and they ended up sleeping with the usher who was in the closet. Person A kept it a secret at first, as they understood the sensitivity. Then they found out Person B is married and has children, which complicates things. The question is whether Person A should expose the cheating, which would also out Person B as gay.\n\nSo, the main ethical dilemma here is between respecting Person B's privacy (and possibly his right to not be outed) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. But Person A was also complicit in the affair. If Person B is cheating on his wife while being married, that's clearly wrong. However, Person A had no idea about the marriage before engaging in the relationship. They might not be in the wrong if they were unaware, but once they found out, their responsibility comes into play.\n\nBut wait, the author is considering exposing the cheater to the wife. If they do that, they're not just reporting the infidelity but also revealing Person B's sexuality. Depending on the context, outing someone can be a serious issue, especially if it's against their wishes. Person B said he's not ready to come out, so Person A would be violating his trust by exposing him. However, the wife is being cheated on, which is a betrayal of her marriage. \n\nBut the author's actions are a bit complex. They didn't know he was married when they started the relationship, so maybe they're not entirely at fault for not checking up on him. However, once they found out, they had a choice to either stop the relationship or take action. If they decided to tell the wife, they might be justified in wanting to protect her, but the method of exposure could also be problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that Person B is in the closet and his parents wouldn't react well to his sexuality adds another layer. Person A is in a position where revealing the infidelity would also out him to the wife and possibly others. But the wife has the right to know about the affair. The author is now conflicted between these two rights: Person B's privacy and the wife's right to know. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if they had an affair with a married man who is in the closet, they were part of a situation where both people are not in a position to be in a relationship. But if Person A is considering exposing the cheating, that could be seen as doing the right thing to inform the wife. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is usually viewed as a violation of their privacy. So even if the intent is good (to inform the wife about the infidelity), the method of doing it by outing Person B as gay might be crossing a line. \n\nBut maybe there's another way to report the infidelity without revealing his sexuality. The author could just tell the wife he's cheating without mentioning the nature of the relationship. However, if the relationship is with another man, it's possible that the wife would eventually find out he's gay through other means. The question is whether the author can ethically disclose the infidelity without outing him. If that's possible, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. But if the only way to inform her would be to out him, then the author might be in a tough spot where they are violating his privacy for her benefit. \n\nAlso, considering the moral dilemma, the author is struggling with their own guilt and wanting to prevent harm to the wife. But the act of exposing the cheater could cause harm to both the wife and the person's family. So it's a balance of harms. The author's decision to out him would be a breach of trust, but the wife is being cheated on. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that the person being cheated on has the right to know, but the one who is in the closet might have a right to self-determination. The author is now in a position where they might be choosing between two wrongs. If they tell the wife, they help her but out her husband. If they don't, they let her be unaware but protect his privacy. \n\nBut the author's initial actions\u2014starting the affair without knowing he was married\u2014might be a problem. They didn't ask questions about his marital status, so they contributed to the situation. However, they might not have known, so their fault could be lesser. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not entirely in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method of doing so (outing him) might be. However, the author is now trying to rectify their mistake by exposing the cheater, which could be seen as a positive action. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now, after the fact. \n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it's more about the initial affair with a married person, but the current dilemma is about the exposure. The answer might hinge on whether the exposure is necessary. If there's a way to tell the wife about the infidelity without outing him (like just saying he's having an affair, not specifying with who), then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. If they have to out him to do so, then it's a different matter. \n\nSince the author is asking if they would be in the wrong for exposing him by outing him, the answer would consider that outing someone, even if they're cheating, could be a violation of their privacy. So, the author's plan to out him in the process of exposing the infidelity might be in the wrong. But if they can find a way to inform the wife without outing him, then that's better. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because exposing the cheater by outing him could be a breach of trust and privacy, even if the intent is good. The author should consider other ways to inform the wife without revealing the husband's sexuality unless the husband is open to that.\n"
