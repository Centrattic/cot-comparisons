I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author met someone at a wedding, they had a relationship, and later found out the guy is married with kids. The guy is also in the closet. The author is torn between telling the wife about the cheating (which would out him) or keeping quiet.\n\nSo, the key points here: the man is cheating, which is wrong, and he's hiding his sexuality. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would involve outing him. The author is worried about the consequences of outing him, like family issues, but also feels the wife has a right to know.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong, so the man is at fault here. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but the method involves outing him. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for planning to expose the cheating? Well, the author is a third party who was part of the affair. However, the author didn't know about the marriage at first. The man lied about his situation. The author confronted him, and he was honest about being in a closeted marriage. \n\nThe author is now in a dilemma: report the cheating (and out him) or stay silent. The author is considering the man's well-being versus the wife's right to know. \n\nIn terms of legal and moral obligations, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the act of outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially in a family where the parents might not be accepting. \n\nThe author isn't the one who cheated; they were deceived. They are trying to balance between two harmful outcomes. Legally, the author isn't obligated to report this. Morally, it's a tough call. But since the author is also part of the relationship, maybe they have some responsibility. \n\nHowever, the author could consider other options, like involving authorities or trying to get the man to come clean. But since the author is the one who had the affair, maybe they are partly responsible. \n\nBut the main question is if the author is in the wrong. The cheater is the one at fault here. The author is trying to do the right thing, even though the method is complicated. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they are trying to correct a wrong done by the cheater. So the answer would be B.\n"
