I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author (a 20-year-old man) had a sexual encounter with a 23-year-old usher at their best friend's sister's wedding. They both agreed to keep it a secret because the usher is gay and not out yet. They ended up hooking up multiple times. Then the author found out the usher is married with two kids, so he's cheating on his wife. The author wants to tell the wife but is worried about outing the usher, given his family's potential reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they expose the cheater, which would out him.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author had a consensual relationship with someone who was married. So, the author is an active participant in the affair. That's a big point. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so the author is complicit in the husband's infidelity. Now, the author is conflicted between protecting the usher's privacy and informing the wife about the cheating.\n\nOn one hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. On the other, outing the usher might cause family issues and breach his privacy. The author's dilemma is between these two moral obligations. \n\nBut wait, the author is also part of the problem here. By engaging in the affair, they contributed to the harm caused to the wife and children. So, if the author is considering exposing the cheater, are they trying to make amends? Or are they just trying to distance themselves from the situation?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the author has a responsibility to inform the wife since she's been wronged. Others might say that the author's own role in the affair makes them complicit, and thus, they shouldn't be the one to expose the cheater, especially if it out him. But in terms of right or wrong, the main issue is whether the author is justified in their actions. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this based on ethical perspectives. If the author decides to tell the wife, they're acting in the wife's best interest, even if it out the usher. However, if they don't, they might be enabling the cheating and not taking responsibility for their own actions. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater? Probably not, because the wife has a right to know. However, the author's participation in the affair complicates things. So the main question is whether the author's decision to expose the cheater (even if it out him) is morally right or wrong. \n\nIn some moral frameworks, the duty to prevent harm to the wife would justify informing her. However, the author's own actions in the affair could be seen as wrong, but that's separate from the decision to expose. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because they're trying to do the right thing for the wife, even though their initial actions were problematic.\n"
