I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is trying to figure out if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater. The situation involves a man who had an affair with the author, is married, and is also in the closet about being gay. The author is torn between exposing him to his wife and not outing him, considering his family's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married without knowing, which is cheating. The author now feels guilty and wants to inform the wife. But doing so would out him as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is trying to balance the wife's right to know about the infidelity against the man's privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nThe key points here are the ethical obligations. The author isn't the one who cheated; they were deceived. The man is the one who violated his marriage by being unfaithful and hiding his sexuality. The author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it means outing him. However, outing someone can have serious consequences, especially in a family that might not accept it. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity and the children's well-being too.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're caught in a difficult position. They didn't know the man was married when they had the relationship, so their initial involvement was based on a lack of information. Now they're trying to make amends by informing the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of privacy. But in this case, it's part of exposing the infidelity. \n\nBut the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it's a tough call. The main wrongdoer here is the married man who cheated and hid his truth. The author's intentions are to correct a wrong, even if it has collateral consequences. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
