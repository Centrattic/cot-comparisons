I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with a man they met at a wedding who is married, thus cheating. The man is in the closet, and the author is considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They had multiple affairs with a married man. That's cheating, which is generally considered wrong. So the author is at fault here for participating in an affair. The question is about whether they're in the wrong now for considering exposing him.\n\nThe man is in a difficult position, closeted, married, and cheating. The author is conflicted between protecting his privacy (not outing him) and informing the wife (which would out him). The user wants to know if the author is wrong for considering this.\n\nThe key points are: The author was complicit in the cheating. They now want to expose the man to his wife, which would ruin his marriage and out him, causing family issues. The author is in a moral dilemma between two wrongs: keeping the secret or exposing him. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author is the one who had the affair. They enabled the cheating. So in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is definitely part of the problem. Even if they're trying to inform the wife, they are still part of the infidelity. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Given that the author was involved in the cheating, they are in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
