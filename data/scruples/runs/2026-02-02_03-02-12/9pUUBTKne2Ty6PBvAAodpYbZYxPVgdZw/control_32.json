I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation presented. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where they had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and in the closet. The man (let's call him John) is married with two kids, and the author found out he's cheating via dating apps. The author is now considering exposing John's infidelity to his wife, which would also out him as gay, even though he's not ready. The dilemma is whether the author should tell the wife, risking outing John, or stay silent.\n\nSo, the main ethical conflict here is between the man's right to privacy and the wife's right to know about her husband's infidelity. The author is conflicted because they don't want to out John, especially given his family's likely negative reaction, but they also feel a duty to the wife.\n\nNow, let's consider the author's actions. Initially, the author had a consensual relationship with John, who was married. That's cheating, so the author is complicit in the infidelity. However, the author didn't know about the marriage at the time. Once they found out, they realized the mistake and confronted John, who was crying and said he wants to leave but can't. \n\nThe author is now considering exposing this to the wife, which would involve sharing personal information about John's sexuality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they proceed. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a tough spot. On one hand, they're helping the wife by informing her of her husband's infidelity, which is a breach of trust. On the other hand, outing someone in the closet can have serious consequences for their mental health, family relationships, and personal safety. The author also acknowledges that John's parents might not accept his sexuality, which adds another layer of potential harm.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author's initial involvement was consensual and without the wife's knowledge. They had a series of relationships, which could be seen as contributing to the problem. However, once they discovered the marriage, they tried to address it with John. Now, the author is considering taking a step that could cause significant harm to John but might benefit the wife.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to expose John? If the author shares the information with the wife, they are fulfilling a duty to the spouse but violating John's privacy. If they don't, they might be enabling the cheating but protecting John's privacy. The question hinges on which ethical duty is more important: the wife's right to know versus John's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to privacy is significant, especially when it comes to personal identity like sexuality. Outing someone without their consent is generally considered a violation of that right. However, informing a spouse about infidelity is often seen as a moral obligation. The conflict here is between two important ethical principles.\n\nThe author might argue that they're helping the wife by exposing the infidelity, but the method involves outing John, which complicates things. If there's a way to inform the wife without outing John (like revealing the cheating without detailing his sexuality), that might be better. But the author is unsure if that's possible. If the only way to tell the wife the truth is to out John, then the author is causing harm to both the wife and John, which is a serious ethical dilemma.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a tough spot. However, the initial act of having a consensual relationship with a married man is problematic. But the main question is about whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose the infidelity. If the author's intention is to help the wife, it could be seen as a moral action, but the method of outing John complicates that. The answer might depend on whether the author can separate the infidelity from the outing. If they can't, then they might be causing unnecessary harm. If they can, then it's a better choice. Since the author isn't sure, maybe the better approach is to find a way to inform the wife without violating John's privacy, perhaps by contacting the wife directly and not mentioning his sexuality unless necessary. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are in a gray area, but the main issue is the conflict between the two ethical duties. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to do the right thing, but they need to be cautious about the method. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater (which would involve outing him), the answer might lean towards B (No), because the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it's a difficult situation.\n"
