I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The author is conflicted about exposing the cheating because it would out him, but also feels the wife has a right to know.\n\nFirst, the author had a consensual relationship with someone who is married. But wait, the man was married and having an affair, so he's the one who's cheating. The author, however, was aware he was gay but not that he was married. So the author didn't know about the marriage when they started the relationship. But after finding out, they confront him, and he admits he's cheating and wants to leave his wife but can't because of the kids.\n\nNow, the dilemma is whether to tell the wife, which would out the man. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would lead to outing him. The question is if the author is in the wrong by doing so.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, who's being cheated on. The man is the one who's unfaithful and hiding his sexuality. The author's actions could be seen as protecting the wife's right to know. But on the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without their consent can be a violation of their privacy, especially if it's against their wishes. The man is in the closet, and the author promised not to tell anyone about his sexuality.\n\nBut the author's main issue is that the man was married and cheating, so the author's relationship with him was part of the infidelity. However, the author might not be at fault because they didn't know about the marriage when the relationship started. The problem is the man's deception. The author is now faced with the consequence of that deception and the moral choice of whether to expose the cheating, which would out him.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the man's actions, the author's intent is to inform the wife about the cheating, which is a separate issue from outing him. However, the method of informing the wife might inherently involve outing him, which complicates things. There might be a way to inform the wife without outing him, like through a third party or anonymously, but the author is considering direct exposure.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't the one who's cheating; the man is. The author's actions are a reaction to being misled. However, by having a relationship with a married man, the author might be complicit in the cheating, but that's a different angle. The key is whether informing the wife is the right action. If the author does it in a way that respects the man's privacy as much as possible (without outing him), that's better. But if outing him is inevitable, then the author's intent is to prevent further harm to the wife, which could justify it.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it leads to outing him. The main wrongdoer here is the cheater. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
