I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male who's married and a father. The man was in the closet and asked the author not to out him. The author now knows the man is cheating and wants to inform the wife, which would out him as gay. \n\nThe key points here are the author's actions. The author had consensual sex with the man, who was married. The author didn't know about the marriage at the time. The man is cheating on his wife, which is a separate issue. Now the author is conflicted between exposing the cheating (which would out the man) and keeping the secret.\n\nThe author's mistake was getting involved with a married man. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the infidelity, leading to outing the man. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a serious issue. The author had promised not to out him, so doing so could be a betrayal of trust. \n\nBut the man is cheating, which is harmful to his family. The author's dilemma is between two harms: outing someone's sexuality versus allowing continued infidelity. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. However, the initial relationship was consensual between two adults. The real wrong here is the man's cheating. The author isn't obligated to report it unless there's legal implications, but morally, it's a gray area. \n\nIf the author chooses to inform the wife, it's a breach of the man's privacy, but it's also trying to prevent further harm. If the author keeps quiet, they're not taking responsibility for their role in the situation. \n\nBut the key is that the author's actions led to the relationship. Since they knew he was in the closet, they might have a duty to avoid further harm. However, the author isn't the man's spouse; they don't have the right to expose his infidelity unless there's a direct impact on them. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't in the wrong for considering the options. They're in a difficult position and trying to weigh moral responsibilities. The answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
