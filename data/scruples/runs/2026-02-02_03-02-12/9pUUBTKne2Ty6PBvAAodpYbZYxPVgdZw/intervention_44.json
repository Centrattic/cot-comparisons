I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who had an affair with someone who's married to a woman, and he's gay and closeted. The author wants to expose him for cheating but doesn't want to out him. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the man is cheating on his wife, which is a violation of their marriage. The author is in a dilemma because they don't want to out him but feel the wife should know. The author has a right to be concerned since they were involved in a relationship with the cheater. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a sensitive issue. The wife's right to know about the infidelity is important, but how to do it without outing the husband?\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is complicit in the affair but didn't know the man was married. On the other, they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife but facing the dilemma of outing him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife? Well, the author might be justified in wanting to inform the wife about the infidelity, but how they go about it matters. Directly telling the wife would out him, which could have severe consequences. The author's intention is to help, but the method could be problematic. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the potential harm of outing someone. The author was told to keep his sexuality a secret and respected that. Now, revealing that to the wife would break that trust. However, the wife's right to know about the cheating is also a factor. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife, but the method could be ethically questionable. \n\nMaybe there's a middle ground, like advising the wife to investigate or working with authorities. But the author is conflicted. The answer hinges on whether the author's intentions are valid and if there's a less harmful way to approach the situation. Since the author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife, their intent is good, but the act of outing could be harmful. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because the moral obligation to the wife might outweigh the potential out.\n"
