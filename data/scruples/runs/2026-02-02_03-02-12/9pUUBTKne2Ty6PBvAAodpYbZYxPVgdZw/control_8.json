I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a man who's married and in the closet. They met at a wedding where the author's friend's sister got married. The author, who's 20, slept with the usher, who's 23. The usher asked not to be outed because he's gay and not ready to come out. They had multiple encounters, and then the author found out the man is married with kids. The author feels bad because they know what cheating is like and want to tell the wife but don't want to out the man, especially since his parents might not accept his sexuality.\n\nSo, the author is torn between telling the wife (which would out the husband) and keeping quiet. The dilemma is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to expose the cheating, which would involve outing him.\n\nLet me think about the key points. The author is not the one who cheated; the husband did. The author had consensual relationships, not knowing he was married. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to inform the wife. The husband is already in a situation where he's cheating and hiding his sexuality. \n\nIs the author responsible for the husband's actions? The author didn't know he was married initially. The husband is the one who's lying to his wife and hiding his true self. The author, while maybe a bit naive in getting involved, isn't the one who's committed adultery. \n\nBut the author is considering exposing the husband, which would out him. Is that justified? The author's intention is to help the wife by informing her of the cheating. However, outing someone without their consent is a serious matter, even if the reason is to protect someone else. \n\nBut wait, the author is also considering the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the husband's right to privacy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife? If the author tells the wife, they're not the one who committed the infidelity. However, by doing so, they're also outing the husband, which could have serious consequences. But the husband's actions (cheating and lying) are the root of the problem. The author is a third party here. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as enabling the cheating by continuing the relationship after finding out. But the author did confront the husband and felt bad, which shows they have some moral conflict. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author is obligated to act. The wife has a right to know about the cheating, but the author isn't in a position to mediate that. However, the author's actions in telling the wife would involve outing the husband, which is a separate issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, which would out him? The author is not the cheater. The cheater is the husband. The author's involvement might be a mistake, but they didn't know he was married initially. The author's intent to inform the wife is to do the right thing, but the method involves outing the husband. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, the author isn't the one who's at fault here. The husband is the one who's cheating and hiding his sexuality. The author is trying to correct a wrong by the husband. However, the act of outing someone can be a violation of their privacy, even if the motive is good. \n\nBut given that the husband is already cheating and hiding a major part of his identity, the author is in a tough spot. It's a balance between the wife's right to know and the husband's right to privacy. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might be a minor participant in the situation, the main wrongdoer is the husband. The author's intention to inform the wife is an attempt to correct the husband's wrong, but the means of doing so (outing) complicates it. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing, even if the method is questionable. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
