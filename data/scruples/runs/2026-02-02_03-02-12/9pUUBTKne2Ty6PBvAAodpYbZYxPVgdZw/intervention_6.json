I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man, who is married and has two children. The man, who is in the closet about being gay, asked the author not to tell anyone. The author kept this secret but later found out the man is married and cheating. Now, the author is conflicted between exposing the cheater (which would out him as gay) and keeping it secret to protect his family from potential backlash.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider the moral and ethical implications here. On one hand, the author was deceived because the man didn't disclose his marital status. The author might feel a duty to inform the wife about the cheating. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent, especially if it could harm their family, is a serious matter. There's also the fact that the author was complicit in keeping the man's sexuality a secret, which might affect their responsibility.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, adultery isn't a crime, so the author isn't breaking any laws by not reporting it. However, the ethical duty to the wife is conflicting with the duty to the man's privacy and potential family dynamics.\n\nThe author's intentions matter. They feel guilty because they've been cheated on before and understand the impact. They want to do the right thing but are torn between two harmful outcomes. There's no clear right answer here, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to expose the cheater, leading to outing him.\n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, they could be seen as helping the wife know the truth, which is her right. However, outing someone against their wishes is a violation of trust, even if the man was deceptive. The author might be in a difficult position where either choice has negative consequences. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to act in good faith, even if the outcome is messy.\n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong if they violate the man's trust without a strong justification. But since the man was cheating, there's an argument that the wife deserves to know. The author's dilemma is between two ethical obligations. The decision to expose the cheater might be justified as a moral duty to the wife, even if it out the man.\n\nSo considering all angles, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're in a tough spot and trying to balance conflicting obligations without a clear solution. Their intent is to do the right thing, even though the consequences are uncertain.\n"
