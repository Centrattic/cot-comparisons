I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is a 20-year-old who had a sexual relationship with a male usher (23 years old) at his best friend's sister's wedding. The usher is married, with two kids, and the wife was out of the country. The author didn't know he was married and they ended up hooking up multiple times. Now the author found out he's married and is considering whether to tell the wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially exposing the cheater by informing the wife. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They had a relationship with someone who was married without knowing the husband's marital status. The husband is in the closet, so the author didn't know about the marriage initially. But after the fact, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him. \n\nThe author is considering exposing the cheater, which would involve outing him. The dilemma is between protecting the husband's privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife? Well, the author didn't know about the husband's marriage at the time of the affair. So they weren't intentionally cheating on the wife. But now that they know, they have a moral obligation to the wife? Or is the author not responsible because they weren't aware?\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a situation where they were deceived by the husband. The husband lied about his status. The author might feel that the wife has a right to know, especially if the husband is cheating. But outing someone's sexual orientation can have serious consequences, even if it's to expose infidelity. \n\nThe author's dilemma is between two wrongs: outing someone (which can be harmful) or allowing a spouse to be cheated on without knowing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to inform the wife, even if it means outing him.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, typically, a spouse has the right to know about infidelity. However, the author isn't in a position to expose the husband unless they have a direct responsibility to the wife. Since the author isn't the husband's partner, maybe they don't have the right to involve themselves in the wife's knowledge. But the wife is being cheated on, so there might be an argument that the author has a duty to inform her, especially if the husband is using the closet to hide his infidelity.\n\nHowever, the author's own actions in having a sexual relationship with a married man could be seen as unethical, even if they were unaware initially. But since they didn't know, maybe they can't be blamed for that. The main issue is whether informing the wife is the right thing to do.\n\nIf the author chooses to tell the wife, they are taking a stand against infidelity, which could be seen as right. But the act of outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. So even if the husband is cheating, the author's method of exposing it might be problematic.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they decide to tell the wife, the wrongness would depend on the method. If they can tell the wife without outing him, that might be better. But if outing is the only way, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the wife's right to know outweighs the husband's privacy in this case. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not have the authority to intervene in the husband's marriage. It's possible that the author's role here is not to take sides but to consider the consequences. However, the author's own relationship with the husband complicates this. They might be seen as an accomplice to the infidelity, but again, they were unaware initially.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision to inform the wife might be morally justified to protect her from being cheated on, even if it means outing the husband. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do that. The answer would be B (No).\n"
