I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is 20, had a series of sexual encounters with a man who was married and in the closet. The author found out the man is married with kids and is cheating on his wife. Now they're conflicted about whether to expose him, which would out him as gay, even though he's not ready to come out. The question is if the author is in the wrong if they decide to tell the wife, thereby outing him.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married without knowing. They were both adults, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault for not knowing. But since they had a relationship, there's a question of consent and responsibility. The man didn't disclose his marital status, which is a big deal. The author might be complicit in the cheating by engaging in it, but they didn't know initially. However, after finding out, they did continue the relationship, which could be a problem.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing the man to his wife. This would involve outing him as gay, which he's not ready to do. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know she's been cheated on and the man's desire to stay closeted. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between the harm of keeping the secret (the wife being cheated on) and the harm of outing him (family issues, social stigma). The author might think they're doing the right thing by informing the wife, but outing someone's sexuality without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. However, the wife has a right to know about infidelity. \n\nBut the author is not the one who committed the infidelity; the man did. The author is in a tricky position. If they inform the wife, they're helping her but outing him. If they don't, they're letting her continue to be deceived. \n\nIs the author in the wrong if they go ahead? Well, the author isn't the cheater, but they were part of the affair. However, they didn't know the marital status initially. After finding out, continuing the relationship might be considered wrong, but they do feel remorse. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author has the right to expose the man's sexuality to his wife. Outing someone is a serious action, even if the intention is to protect the wife. The author might be crossing a line by using the information about his sexuality to inform the wife. There's also the question of whether the author can be sure that the wife would appreciate being informed this way. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel obligated to tell the wife, but they also have a duty to respect the man's privacy. The dilemma is between two wrongs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose to inform the wife, they might be acting in the wife's interest but violating the man's privacy. If they don't, they're allowing the wife to be deceived. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances and cultural context, but generally, outing someone without their consent is problematic. The author could be seen as in the wrong for outing him, even with good intentions, because they're breaching confidentiality. However, if the author is also complicit in the cheating, they might share some responsibility. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong if they expose the cheater by outing him. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering the ethical implications, outing someone's sexuality is often considered a violation, even if the reason is to inform the wronged spouse. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for outing him, so the answer would be A.\n"
