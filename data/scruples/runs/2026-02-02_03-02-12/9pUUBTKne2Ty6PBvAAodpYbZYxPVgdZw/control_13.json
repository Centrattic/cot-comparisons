I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The story is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a one-night stand with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher is married with two kids and is in the closet. The author found out later that the usher is married, so he's cheating on his wife. Now the author is conflicted between exposing the husband to his wife (which would out him as gay) or keeping it a secret to protect his family from potential issues.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author had a sexual relationship with a married man, which is cheating. The usher is gay and hasn't come out yet. The author wants to tell the wife about the cheating, which would out her husband. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he had multiple sexual encounters with someone who is married. That's definitely unethical and wrong because it's cheating. The usher was in a committed marriage, so the author's behavior is a violation of that relationship. So in that aspect, the author is at fault. But the user is more focused on whether exposing the cheater is wrong.\n\nThe author is now considering exposing the husband's infidelity to his wife. The problem is that this would out the husband as gay, which he's not ready to do. The author is trying to balance between protecting the husband's privacy and informing the wife of her husband's infidelity. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is it the author's responsibility to inform the wife? The wife has a right to know about the cheating, but the husband's sexual orientation is a different matter. However, in this case, the two are linked because the infidelity is with another man. So if the author tells the wife, he's both exposing the infidelity and revealing his husband's sexuality. \n\nBut the author is in a difficult position. The author might not be directly responsible for the husband's cheating, but the author is complicit in the infidelity. The key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for being involved in the affair. Since the author was aware that the husband was married and still continued the relationship, that's definitely a problem. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding the decision to expose the cheater. The author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, knowing that it would out the husband. The author's dilemma is more about moral responsibility towards the wife vs. the husband's privacy. \n\nBut the initial act of the author (having the affair) is wrong. So the answer is that the author is in the wrong for being involved in the affair. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just about the exposure but the entire situation. The user's scenario is about the exposure part, but the root issue is the author's actions in the affair. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he was complicit in the infidelity. Even if the exposure part is a moral dilemma, the fact that he was involved in the affair makes him at fault."
