I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author slept with a married man, who is also their friend's sister's husband. The man is in the closet, and the author is considering exposing the cheating but doesn't want to out him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a relationship with someone who is married, so that's an affair. He's 20 and the man is 23, which is an age where they're both adults. The man asked the author not to tell anyone because he's gay and not ready to come out. The author is now conflicted between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author did something wrong. If B, then they didn't. \n\nWell, the author was in a sexual relationship with a married man, which is a betrayal. So the author is at fault here. But the man is also cheating, so he's not blameless. The dilemma is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater. \n\nThe post says the author is considering telling the wife, which would essentially out him. Legally and ethically, if the author is the one who cheated, they might not have the right to expose the man. However, in terms of the moral dilemma, the user is asking if the author is wrong for wanting to do that. \n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it's because they were part of the cheating. But if the question is about the act of exposing the cheater, then the author might be in the wrong for outing him, even though he is the one who cheated. Wait, but in this case, the author is the one who had the affair. So the author is in a position where they are part of the infidelity. The man is the married person who had the affair. The author is now trying to decide whether to tell the wife, but that would out the man. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. The user is asking if the author is wrong for wanting to do that. \n\nSo the main issue here is the author's actions in both being part of the affair and the potential exposure. The author is part of the problem, but the dilemma is about the next step. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical advice, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author is in the wrong for having an affair with a married man. But the act of exposing the cheater might not be wrong, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doing so. However, since the author is part of the infidelity, they might be considered at fault. \n\nAlternatively, the user is seeking advice on whether they should expose the cheater. The question is if the author is in the wrong for doing that. If the author is the one who cheated, then the act of exposing the cheater (the man) could be seen as a way to shift blame. \n\nBut the user's situation is that they are conflicted between the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. The author is part of the affair, so they are complicit. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, which is the man. \n\nSo the answer would likely be A, because the author is part of the cheating. They had the affair, so they're at fault. But the user is asking if they're in the wrong for exposing the cheater. However, in this case, the author is the one who was involved in the affair, so they are part of the problem. But the act of exposing the cheater (the man) is not their main wrongdoing. The main issue is their own participation in the affair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater. So, if the author is already in the wrong for the affair, then they might still be in the wrong regardless of their next actions. But the user is asking specifically about the exposure part. \n\nIn many cases, when someone is in an affair, they are in a morally wrong position. The author had consensual sex with a married man, so they are part of the infidelity. However, if they were to expose the man, the wife has a right to know, but the author could be seen as complicit. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for both being part of the affair and for considering to expose the cheater, which might not be their place. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. The exposure itself could be considered wrong if it violates the man's privacy, especially since he's in the closet. Even though he's the one who cheated, outing him without consent could be wrong. However, the author is part of the cheating, so they are already in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A because the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. The dilemma about exposing the cheater is a secondary issue, but the primary problem is their own actions.\n"
