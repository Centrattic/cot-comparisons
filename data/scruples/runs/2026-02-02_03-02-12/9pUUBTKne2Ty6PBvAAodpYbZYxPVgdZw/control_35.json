I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Approaching This Situation) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 20 years old and had a one-night stand with a 23-year-old man, who's the brother of their friend. The man was married and in the closet. After sleeping together multiple times, the author found out he's married with kids. The author is now considering exposing the cheating to the wife, which would out him as gay. The dilemma is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially outing him while informing the wife.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had consensual relationships with someone who's married. The man is cheating, and the author is considering breaking his confidentiality (since he asked not to be outed) to inform the wife. The author's concern is about the morality of outing him versus the wife's right to know.\n\nFirst, the author's responsibility. They had consensual encounters, so maybe they're not at fault for being cheated on, but they did know he was married. Wait, did the author know he was married when they started sleeping together? The scenario says the author found out a week ago that he was married. So before that, they didn't know. The author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. That's important. The man lied about his marital status. So the author wasn't in a position to know, which might reduce their fault in that aspect.\n\nBut then, when they found out, the author is considering exposing the infidelity, which would out him. So the question is, is the author in the wrong for doing that? The man is in a cheating situation, which is wrong, but he's in a closeted situation. The author might feel a duty to the wife to tell the truth. However, by doing so, they would be outing him, which he requested not to happen.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They had a consensual relationship, but the man was married. The author might feel guilt because they contributed to the cheating, but the main issue is the man's deceit. The author's intention is to inform the wife, which is a matter of loyalty to the wife's right to know. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is generally considered a violation of privacy, especially if the person is in the closet. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as a conflict between the wife's rights and the man's privacy. If the author is the one who had the affair, they might be complicit in the cheating, which complicates their moral standing. But if the man is the one who cheated, the primary wrongdoer is him. The author's dilemma is whether they have the right to expose him, even if it out him, given that he's the one who lied.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if they decide to inform the wife, they might be doing the right thing from the wife's perspective but violating the man's privacy. On the other hand, if they don't inform the wife, they're allowing the cheating to continue. However, the author themselves was involved in the cheating, which could make them part of the problem. \n\nBut the author didn't know he was married at the time of the affair. So they might not be at fault for the initial part. The main issue is the decision to inform the wife. If the author is not the one who cheated in a relationship (since the man was married), but had an affair with him, then the author is complicit. However, the man is the one who was married and cheating, so the primary moral fault is on him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong now for wanting to expose the cheating, even if that out him. If they do, they might be doing a moral act by informing the wife, but also violating the man's request for privacy. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. In some views, the wife has a right to know, so the author isn't in the wrong for that. But in terms of outing someone without consent, that's generally seen as wrong. However, since the act of cheating is involved, the author might feel justified.\n\nBut the author is also part of the cheating scenario, so they might be in a position where they have a duty to inform the wife. However, they are also complicit in the infidelity. The answer here is complex. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for informing the wife, but ethically, it's a tough call. The question is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the man.\n\nIn the WIBTA context, the community often considers intent and consequences. The author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife, but the consequence is outing the man. Depending on how the community views the balance between the wife's rights and the man's privacy, the answer could vary. However, since the man is the one who was cheating, the author might not be in the wrong for informing the wife, even if it out him. But since they had the affair, they might be seen as part of the problem, making them complicit in the cheating, which could mean they have some responsibility in the situation.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong now for considering to expose the cheating. If the author is taking responsibility by trying to inform the wife, they might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that they had the affair in the first place could be a point against them. However, they didn't know he was married when they started the affair. So maybe they aren't at fault for that part.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's main action is deciding whether to inform the wife. If they do, they're doing something that could be seen as right by the wife's side but wrong by the man's privacy. But since the man was cheating, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to inform the wife. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
