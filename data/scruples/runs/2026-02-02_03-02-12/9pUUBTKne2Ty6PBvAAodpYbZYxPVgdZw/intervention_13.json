I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a situation where they had a sexual relationship with a married man who's also gay and closeted. They found out he's cheating on his wife. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong if they expose him, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. That's a key point. If he had known, he wouldn't have continued. The man was in the closet, so the author initially kept his secret. Now, the author is conflicted between protecting his privacy and informing his wife about the infidelity.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, so the author isn't breaking any laws. Morally, it's tricky. The author's intention to expose him could be seen as trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent can be harmful and is generally considered a violation of privacy. The author is in a tough spot because they want to right the wrong but are worried about the consequences.\n\nThe author's actions so far were based on information they had at the time. They didn't know about the marriage and the man's other potential affairs. Once they found out, confronting him and feeling conflicted is a natural response. The dilemma is between honesty and privacy. Since the author is considering exposing him to protect the wife, it's a matter of weighing the harm between the wife's right to know versus the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nThere might be a middle ground, like advising the wife to investigate if she suspects infidelity without directly outing him. But since the author is not in a position to mediate that, their choice to inform the wife could be seen as an attempt to help. However, outing someone is a serious action with potential negative impacts. So, while the author's intent is good, the method could be problematic. The answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because they're acting on new information and trying to correct a mistake, but the act of outing could still be seen as wrong regardless of intent.\n"
