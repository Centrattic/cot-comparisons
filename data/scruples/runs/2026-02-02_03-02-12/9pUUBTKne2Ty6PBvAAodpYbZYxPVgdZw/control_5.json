I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them having an affair with someone they found out is married and in a closeted same-sex relationship. The key points here are consent, consent withdrawal, and the ethical implications of exposing someone's infidelity versus outing them.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual encounters with the man, who was in a committed marriage. The man was dishonest about his marital status and his sexuality. The author discovered he was cheating and now faces a dilemma about exposing him to his wife. \n\nLegally and ethically, cheating is a breach of a marriage, so there's a question of whether the wife should be informed. However, the author is also considering outing the man's sexuality, which he's kept private. The author's main conflict is between the duty to inform the wife and respecting the man's privacy.\n\nThe man didn't disclose his marriage or his infidelity, which means he's at fault. The author's actions involved consent initially, but once they learned the truth, their continued involvement could be seen as complicity. However, the author is not the one who initiated the cheating or lied. \n\nWhen considering whether the author is in the wrong, it's important to note that they didn't know the man was married at the time of their encounters. The author is now trying to mitigate the harm by considering telling the wife. However, outing the man's sexuality might not be necessary for the disclosure. For example, the author could inform the wife about the infidelity without revealing the man's sexual orientation. \n\nIf the author shares the information with the wife in a way that doesn't out the man, they might be doing the right thing. But if they include his sexuality, that's a separate issue. The author's mistake might be not figuring out a way to inform the wife without outing him. However, they are not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife about the cheating, as that's her right to know. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author can separate the infidelity disclosure from outing the man. If they can do that, then they're not in the wrong. If they include the sexuality, they might be overstepping. But the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even if the method is tricky, they might not be in the wrong. However, their continued involvement after knowing he's married makes them complicit. But since they didn't know at first, it's a bit more nuanced. \n\nOverall, the main issue is the author's role in the affair without knowing the marital status. Since the man lied, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being deceived. The moral dilemma is about the next steps, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given that, the answer is probably B (No), because the author is trying to correct a mistake and inform the wife, which is the right thing to do, unless outing is unavoidable. But the author is not the one who cheated; the man did. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it leads to outing. However, the act of outing without the man's consent is problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they are trying to do the right thing by the wife, the answer leans towards B.\n"
