I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who had multiple affairs with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The author is now conflicted about whether to expose the cheater, which would also out him as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author initially had a one-night stand at a wedding and agreed not to out the man. They continued the relationship, discovered he's married with kids, and now they're wondering if they should tell his wife, even if it means outing him. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate the ethics here.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong because it betrays the trust of the spouse. However, the author was also deceived because the man was hiding both his marriage and his sexuality. The author might feel guilt and a desire to do the right thing by informing the wife. But outing someone's sexuality without their consent is also a violation of privacy, especially if the man is in the closet. \n\nThere's a conflict between two ethical principles: the right to privacy and the duty to prevent harm. The author's actions could cause significant harm to the man's family relationships if they are not accepting of his sexuality. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity, which is a serious breach in their marriage. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could contact the wife anonymously, but that's risky and might not be effective. Alternatively, advising the man to come out to his wife and family might be a compassionate approach, but the author might not be in a position to force that. \n\nThe author's intent is to do the right thing, but the consequences are complex. If outing the man leads to family rejection and potential harm to the children, is that the author's responsibility? On the other hand, keeping silent allows the cheating to continue, which is also harmful to the wife. \n\nIn such cases, some ethical frameworks suggest that the duty to prevent harm to others (the wife) might outweigh the duty to respect privacy (the man's sexuality). However, others might argue that the author isn't responsible for the man's choices and that the wife should address the issue herself if she suspects infidelity. \n\nThe author was deceived as well; the man lied about his status. So the author's continued relationship was based on false premises. The author might feel a sense of obligation to the wife, but it's also possible the author is being drawn into someone else's marital issues. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot, but their intention to inform the wife is driven by a desire to prevent ongoing harm. However, outing the man without his consent complicates things. The answer might hinge on whether the act of informing the wife necessarily out the man. If there's a way to do it anonymously, that could mitigate some issues, but it's unclear. Given the options, the ethical dilemma is complex, but the author's actions could be seen as an attempt to do the right thing, even if the method has flaws.\n"
