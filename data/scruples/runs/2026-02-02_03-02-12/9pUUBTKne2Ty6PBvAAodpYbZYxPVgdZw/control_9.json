I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. They had multiple affairs, and the man asked not to be outed. Now the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the infidelity, which would involve outing him to her and possibly his family, who are not accepting.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the potential consequences. The man is married, so having an affair is cheating, which is generally considered wrong. The author engaged in this affair knowing he was married and in a closeted situation. That's a red flag. Then, after finding out, the author wants to inform the wife, which would mean outing him, despite his request for privacy.\n\nBut wait, the author's dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. The author is considering exposing the man's affair to the wife, which would effectively out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially exposing the man (outing him) to protect the wife.\n\nThe author's actions up to this point (having an affair with a married person) are already problematic. However, the main issue here is the moral dilemma of whether to inform the wife. If the author tells the wife, they are revealing confidential information and outing the husband. If they don't, the wife remains in the dark about the cheating.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Legally, the author isn't committing a crime by telling the wife, but ethically, it's complex. The author had an affair with a married man, which is cheating. Then, when confronted with the knowledge of the infidelity, the author is conflicted about exposing it. But the husband is the cheater here, not the author. Wait, the author is the one who had the affair. So the author is also cheating. So technically, the author is in the wrong for having an affair with a married person. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the husband.\n\nAlternatively, the user might be considering the author's position as trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it out the husband. The author is in a morally ambiguous situation because they were complicit in the cheating. So, the answer might depend on whether the focus is on the author's initial actions (cheating) versus their current dilemma (exposing the husband).\n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong now, regarding the decision to expose the cheater. If the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it out the husband, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the author is also part of the cheating scenario, which complicates things. But the user's question is about the current action of exposing the cheater, not the initial affair.\n\nSo, the author's initial affair is wrong, but the current dilemma is about whether to inform the wife. If the author decides to tell the wife, that's a breach of confidentiality but a way to protect the wife from being cheated on. However, it also out the husband against his wishes. The author's moral responsibility here is to the wife as well as the husband. \n\nIn legal terms, the author isn't obligated to inform the wife. But ethically, there's an argument for both sides. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which would mean outing him. The answer would depend on whether the author has a duty to the wife and whether outing the husband is justified. Since the author was part of the cheating, they might be in a position where they are not entirely blameless, but the act of informing the wife could be seen as a moral obligation despite the consequences.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. If the author is trying to correct a wrong by informing the wife, they might not be in the wrong. However, since the author was also part of the cheating, that complicates things. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they were complicit in the cheating, but the current action of informing the wife is a separate issue. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described, which includes both their actions and the current dilemma.\n\nI think the key here is that the author had an affair with a married man, which is cheating. That makes the author complicit in the wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. If the author is trying to do the right thing by telling the wife, then maybe they are not in the wrong for that action. But their initial actions (cheating) are wrong. However, the user's question is specifically about the current situation, not the past actions. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which would involve outing him. Given that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out the husband, because the husband was the one who cheated. However, the author is in the wrong for having an affair in the first place. But the question is about the current action. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, not the initial infidelity.\n\nBut the user might be conflating the two. The answer would need to address both. If the author is in the wrong for having the affair, but not for exposing the cheater, then the answer is complex. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong now, in the current situation. The answer would hinge on the justification for exposing the cheater. If the author is trying to do the right thing, then they are not in the wrong. However, the initial action of cheating is separate. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for the act of exposing the cheater, not the initial infidelity.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B) for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out the husband. Because the husband's infidelity is a wrong action, and the wife has a right to know. However, there's a moral dilemma in outing the husband, but the author's intent is to inform the wife, which is a separate issue from the initial cheating. So the answer is B.\n"
