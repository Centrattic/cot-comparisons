I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation involves a complex set of moral and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. They had a relationship with a married man, which is already a problem because he was in a committed marriage. The author was aware he was gay but didn't know he was married or had kids. The key point here is the man's deception. He didn't disclose his marital status or children, which are significant factors in any relationship. The author didn't know these details when they started the affair, so their initial involvement might be seen as a result of the man's dishonesty.\n\nNow, the dilemma is whether to inform the wife about the infidelity. The author is concerned about outing him, which could lead to family issues. But the man is in a committed relationship and has cheated. The wife has a right to know, as she's been deceived. However, the method of disclosure would involve revealing his sexual orientation, which could be seen as a violation of his privacy, even if he's the one who lied.\n\nThe question is whether the author is obligated to tell the wife. In many cases, people might not consider it their responsibility to expose others' infidelity unless they were part of the deception. Here, the man didn't hide being gay but hid his marriage. The author might argue that they weren't the one who lied about his marital status. However, they were part of the affair, which is on them. \n\nBut the act of exposing him to his wife by revealing the affair would inherently out him as gay. The author is in a tough spot because they want to do the right thing by the wife but also don't want to cause harm to the man's family. The man's parents might not accept his sexuality, so outing him could lead to family estrangement. The author has to weigh the wife's right to know against the potential harm to the man and his family.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the man using Grindr, which suggests he might have other partners. The author might feel responsible to inform the wife, but legally and ethically, that's not their role. However, from a moral standpoint, some might argue that the author has a duty to inform the wife. But the author is also someone who has been in a similar situation and has been cheated on before, so they understand the pain. \n\nThe main issue here is the author's own involvement. They were in an affair with a married man, which is wrong regardless of his sexual orientation. The fact that the author continued the relationship after finding out about the marriage makes them complicit in the infidelity. So, the first part of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they participated in the affair despite his marital status, they are at fault. However, the dilemma is whether they are now obligated to expose him, even if it out him. \n\nIf the answer is A, it's because the author was involved in an affair and now wants to expose the cheater. But if the answer is B, it's because the author's intention is to right a wrong by informing the wife, even though it means outing him. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, being an accessory to someone's infidelity is considered wrong, and the author is complicit. However, the act of exposing the infidelity could be seen as a good faith effort to inform the wronged party. The problem is that the author is using the wife's right to know as a justification, but their own actions were also morally wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. The decision to expose the cheater is a separate issue, but their initial actions were part of the problem. So the answer is A.\n"
