I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater (the usher) even if it means outing him. \n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a married man who is gay but closeted. The man asked the author not to tell anyone, and the author agreed. Now, the author knows the man is cheating on his wife, has kids, and his family isn't accepting of his sexuality.\n\nThe author is conflicted between not outing the man (due to his family's potential reaction) and informing the wife about the infidelity. The key points here are the ethics of exposing someone's infidelity versus outing their sexuality. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they might be breaching the man's privacy regarding his sexuality, which he hasn't revealed yet. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know about the cheating, which is a separate issue from his sexual orientation. \n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing him? If the author can disclose the infidelity without revealing his sexuality, that might be the ethical path. But if the infidelity is tied to his being gay (e.g., the author is the other man), then outing him might be unavoidable. \n\nThe author's initial agreement not to tell anyone complicates things. They broke that promise by continuing the relationship and now considering exposing him. However, the cheating is a separate moral issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they decide to inform the wife, they might be doing a moral duty by revealing the cheating, but it could also out him. The wrongness depends on whether the author has the right to expose the man's infidelity without his consent, especially if it leads to outing him. \n\nAlternatively, the author's own role in the affair could be seen as unethical, contributing to the problem. However, the main question is about exposing the cheater. If the author is choosing between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy, it's a tough call. But if they proceed, they might be wrong in violating the man's confidentiality, even if the intent is to protect the wife.\n"
