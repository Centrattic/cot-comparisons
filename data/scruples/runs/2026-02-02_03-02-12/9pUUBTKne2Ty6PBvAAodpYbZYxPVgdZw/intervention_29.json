I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which might out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married and in the closet. They had multiple affairs, and now the author discovered the man is married with kids. The author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, knowing that doing so would out him, which could have serious consequences for his family.\n\nThe key points here are the ethical considerations: the right of the wife to know she's been cheated on versus the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is torn between these two. The man is in the closet, possibly due to family pressures, and outing him could lead to familial issues. However, the wife has the right to know about the infidelity.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between two rights. On one side, the wife's right to know about the cheating. On the other, the man's right to privacy regarding his sexual orientation. The author is trying to decide if they have an obligation to inform the wife, even if it means outing him. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to inform the wife unless they're in a position where they have a responsibility to do so, like a legal duty or a role that requires it (e.g., a spouse). However, the author is a friend of the family, not directly involved in the marriage. So, the duty here is more about moral obligation than legal. \n\nOuting someone without consent is generally considered wrong, as it can lead to significant personal and social consequences. However, in this case, the act of informing the wife might inherently involve outing him. The author is trying to balance these two aspects. \n\nThe man is the one who is cheating, which is a breach of trust in his marriage. The author's actions would affect both the wife and the man, and possibly his family. The author's intention is to inform the wife to prevent further cheating, but the means might involve outing him. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if they choose to inform the wife, it's a complex situation. However, the author isn't the one who caused the cheating; they are a third party. The man is the one who broke the marital vows. \n\nIf the author decides to inform the wife, they might be doing the right thing to protect her, but it comes at the cost of outing him. However, if they choose not to inform her, they might be enabling the cheating. \n\nThe question is whether the author is morally obligated to act. Since they are not the spouse, their obligation is less clear. But given that they were involved in the affair, they have some moral responsibility. However, the act of outing someone is a serious matter. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to privacy is important, but so is the right of a spouse to know about infidelity. If the author is the only one who knows about the cheating, they might feel a duty to inform the wife. However, outing someone could have severe consequences, so it's a tough call. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering informing the wife, but they need to weigh the consequences carefully. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances and the potential impact on all parties involved.\n"
