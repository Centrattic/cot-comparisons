I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (a 20-year-old man) had a sexual relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They met at a wedding, slept together, and continued the relationship multiple times. Now the author found out the man is married with kids and wants to tell the wife, which would out him. The author is torn between not wanting to out him and feeling the wife has a right to know.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. He had a relationship with someone he knew was in a committed marriage, which is cheating. But he didn't know the man was married when they started. Wait, the man told him he was in the closet but didn't mention being married. The author might have been unaware of the marital status. But after finding out, the author is considering exposing the cheating, which would out the man. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the initial relationship was consensual between two adults. However, since the man is married, any sexual relationship with him would be considered cheating. The author didn't know he was married, but after finding out, he's now in a position where he's considering exposing the man. \n\nThe dilemma is whether the author should inform the wife. If he does, he's outing the man, which might cause family issues. If he doesn't, the wife remains in the dark. But the author might be complicit in the cheating by continuing the relationship after knowing. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it means outing the man. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as the husband is the one who cheated. But the author's initial actions (sleeping with a married man) could be seen as wrong, even if he didn't know initially. \n\nBut the key is whether the author is in the wrong now. The question is about the current situation: exposing the cheater by outing him. The author is in a moral dilemma, trying to balance two wrongs. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. In some views, the author has a duty to inform the wife, even if it out the man. Others might say the author shouldn't get involved. \n\nBut according to the \"What Would You Do\" context, the author is seeking advice, not having already acted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to expose the cheater by outing him. If the answer is A (yes), it would mean the author is wrong to out him. If B (no), then it's not wrong. \n\nConsidering the situation, the author is trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, which is a good intention. Even though it out the man, the husband's infidelity is the primary issue. The author's action could be seen as a form of justice for the wife. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong (B). However, some might argue that the author shouldn't meddle. But given the circumstances, the author's intent is to prevent further harm, which could justify the action.\n"
