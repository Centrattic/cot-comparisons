I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a married man who is in the closet. The man asked not to be outed, and the author initially respected that. But now, the author is conflicted because they found out he's married and cheating, and they feel the wife should know. \n\nSo the main issue is the moral dilemma between protecting someone's privacy (the man's sexuality) versus informing his wife about the infidelity. \n\nThe author is in a situation where they are the one who had an affair. They might be complicit in the cheating. But they're also considering exposing him to protect the wife. \n\nBut wait, the author's actions here are about whether to report the cheating, which would out him. The key here is whether the author has a right to involve the wife, even if it means outing him. \n\nThe WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) aspect is about whether the author is being selfish or acting in a justifiable way. The author might argue they're doing the right thing by informing the wife. But by outing someone without their consent, even for a good reason, it's a violation of privacy. \n\nAlso, the author had consensual affairs. They might not have the authority to report the man's actions. The wife's right to know is a factor, but the author isn't in a position to act as a third-party informant. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the man being in the closet. Outing someone can have severe personal and family consequences. The author could be causing harm, even if the man is cheating. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's plan to expose the cheater by outing him might be crossing a line. They're using the wife's right to know as an excuse to violate the man's privacy. The author is in a position of complicity by being part of the affair and then taking it upon themselves to act as a whistleblower. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. They should consider other options, like letting the wife find out on her own or seeking professional help rather than taking it upon themselves to expose the man, which ends up violating his privacy and outing him against his wishes.\n"
