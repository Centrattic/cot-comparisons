I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is complicated. So, the author is in a situation where they had multiple affairs with a married man who is also gay and closeted. The author found out he's married with kids and feels conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, even though that would out him.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the potential consequences. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would involve outing the man. The question is whether they are in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with someone who was married. That's cheating, so the man is at fault there. But the author is now trying to decide if they should tell his wife. The moral dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (since he's closeted) and informing the wife about the infidelity. \n\nThe author might argue that the wife has a right to know about the cheating. However, the act of telling the wife would also reveal the man's sexuality, which he hasn't come out about. The author is trying to navigate the ethical responsibility here. \n\nIs the author responsible for the man's infidelity? Not really; the man made the choice to cheat. The author's mistake could be in not checking if he was single before engaging in a relationship. But the author is now trying to make amends by considering informing the wife. \n\nHowever, outing someone's sexuality without their consent can be harmful, especially if the person's family is not accepting. The author is aware that the man's parents might not react well to him being gay. So there's a risk of family turmoil. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They could be seen as trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even if it out the man. But they could also be seen as overstepping, as they were part of the infidelity. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel obligated to disclose because they were involved in the cheating. But the act of outing the man complicates things. It's a balance between two wrongs: cheating and hiding one's identity. \n\nThe answer might hinge on the author's intent. If the main goal is to inform the wife of the cheating without outing the man, that's one thing. But if the information can't be provided without outing him, the author's responsibility might be questioned. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions in considering to tell the wife are out of a sense of moral obligation, but it's a gray area. However, since the author was part of the infidelity, some might argue they have no place to decide for the man. Others might see it as a way to make amends. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to correct a mistake by considering informing the wife, even though it's a difficult situation. But others might argue that the author is complicit and shouldn't be the one to decide. However, the author is seeking advice, which shows they are trying to do the right thing.\n"
