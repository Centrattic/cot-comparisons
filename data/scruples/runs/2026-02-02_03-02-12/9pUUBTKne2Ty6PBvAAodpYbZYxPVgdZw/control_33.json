I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a complex mix of cheating, being closeted, and moral dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man who is married and has kids. The man is gay but hasn't come out yet. The author found out about the marriage and now is considering exposing the man's infidelity to his wife, which would also out him as gay. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do that.\n\nSo, the author is in a tricky spot. The man cheated, which is a serious issue. The wife has a right to know, but outing the man could lead to family issues. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nBut wait, the author was also part of the cheating. They had multiple encounters. So maybe the author is partially at fault for the affair. But the question is about the author's decision to expose the cheater. If the author tells the wife, would they be in the wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author is taking responsibility by considering telling the wife, even if it's uncomfortable. On the other hand, the author was involved in the affair, so their motives might not be purely altruistic. Also, outing someone's sexuality without consent is generally not okay. However, in this case, it's tied to cheating, which is a different issue.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's role in the infidelity, the potential harm in outing the man, and the wife's right to know. The author might be trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, but the method might involve outing the man, which complicates things. However, there might be a way to inform the wife without directly outing the man's sexuality. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without revealing the man's sexual orientation, that would be better. But if the only way is by outing him, then the author might be making a tough choice between two wrongs.\n\nBut the author's intention is to do the right thing, even if it's painful. However, being involved in the affair could make the author complicit. The main issue is whether exposing the man's infidelity is the right action regardless of the consequences. Since the author is trying to inform the wife, which is a responsible action, even if it's uncomfortable, they might not be in the wrong. But the fact that they were part of the cheating complicates their position. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
