I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which might involve outing him.\n\nFirst, the author had a consensual encounter with a man they met at a wedding. The man was married and in the closet, which the author found out later. The author is now conflicted about whether to tell his wife, knowing it would out him. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author has a moral obligation to reveal the infidelity. On one hand, the author is trying to respect the man's privacy about his sexuality. On the other, the man is in a committed relationship and has a duty of honesty to his wife. Cheating is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know about the breach of trust.\n\nBut the author is not the one who cheated. They were, in a way, deceived by the man who kept his relationship secret. The author didn't know he was married when they started seeing each other. So, the author's role here is complicated. They might feel guilt because they were involved in a relationship that was unfaithful, but they weren't the one who committed the infidelity in the first place. \n\nThe dilemma is whether to prioritize the man's privacy (and potential family well-being) or the wife's right to know about being cheated on. Since the author is not the spouse, their duty isn't as clear. However, the act of exposing the cheater could cause significant harm to the man's reputation and family, even if it's to tell the truth. \n\nI think the key here is that the author was not the one who committed the infidelity. The married man made choices that led to this situation. The author's involvement, while perhaps careless or ill-advised, doesn't make them the wrongdoer. The real wrong is the cheating and the decision to hide his sexuality from his wife, which is the spouse's issue. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him. Their intent is to inform the wife of the betrayal, which is a valid concern. However, the ethical choice might involve finding a way to inform the wife without outing him, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering it. So, the answer would lean towards B (No).\n"
