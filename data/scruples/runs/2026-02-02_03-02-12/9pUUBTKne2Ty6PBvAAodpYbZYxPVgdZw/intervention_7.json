I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone who had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The author is considering exposing the cheater but is conflicted about outing him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. They knew he was in the closet and agreed not to tell anyone. Now they found out he's married and have to decide whether to tell the wife, which would out him. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for possibly doing that.\n\nSo the ethical dilemma here is between protecting someone's privacy (the man's sexuality) and preventing harm to another person (the wife being cheated on). The author is trying to balance these two. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. But outing someone against their wishes can have serious consequences, especially if the family is unsupportive. The author might be seen as helping the wife but at the cost of violating the man's confidentiality. \n\nBut the author's own actions\u2014engaging in an affair\u2014could be seen as problematic. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for exposing the cheater. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe others might argue that the author shouldn't interfere, especially since they were involved in the affair themselves. \n\nI need to consider legal and moral angles. Legally, the wife's right to know might take precedence, but morally, outing someone without consent is a big deal. However, the author is in a complex position because they were part of the affair. \n\nThe answer might depend on the context: if the author is trying to prevent further harm by informing the wife, but doing so by outing the husband. Since the author's actions were consensual with the husband, but now they want to protect the wife, it's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's intention is to stop the cheating and protect the wife, they might not be in the wrong. But if the act of outing is harmful without a valid reason, maybe they are. However, the wife's right to know is a strong point. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to inform the wife, despite outing the husband, could be seen as morally justified to prevent ongoing betrayal. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
