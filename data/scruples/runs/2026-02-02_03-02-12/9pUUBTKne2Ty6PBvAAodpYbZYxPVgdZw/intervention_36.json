I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, choosing between A or B. The situation involves the author sleeping with someone who's married and gay, then considering exposing the cheating but outing him in the process.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who was in the closet. The man cheated, and the author now feels conflicted about whether to tell his wife, which would out him. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to analyze the ethics here.\n\nThe author initially agreed not to out the man when he was honest about being gay. Then, the author found out he's married and cheating. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nIs the author morally responsible? The author was deceived by the man, who lied about his marital status. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. The author is now trying to do the right thing by the wife but causing a conflict with the man's privacy. \n\nOuting someone can be a serious breach of trust, but so can cheating. The author is in a tough spot. Legally, the wife might need to know to protect her marriage, but ethically, outing someone's sexuality without consent is problematic. There's no perfect answer here. The author is trying to balance two wrongs. Since the author was a victim of the man's deception, maybe they aren't in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, even if it leads to outing him. So the answer might be B.\n"
