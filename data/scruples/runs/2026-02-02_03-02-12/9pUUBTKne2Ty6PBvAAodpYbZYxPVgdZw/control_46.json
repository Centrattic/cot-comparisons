I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author is a 20-year-old man who had a relationship with a married man, someone they met at a wedding. They ended up sleeping together multiple times, but the married man was in the closet. Now the author found out he's married with kids and is cheating. The dilemma is whether to expose the cheater without outing him, but that seems impossible.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had a sexual relationship with someone who was married. The married man was gay but not out, and he asked the author to keep it a secret. The author respected his privacy at first. But now, they feel guilty because they know he's cheating and want to tell the wife. The author is conflicted between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the author is not the one who cheated; they were the other person. But they were aware that the married man was in a situation where he was cheating. The author might be complicit in the cheating, but they didn't know he was married at first. However, after finding out, they still continued the relationship. That part might be a problem because they were aware of the situation and kept going. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't know he was married until later. So initially, they had no idea. The married man didn't disclose that he was married, which is the main issue. The author's role here is complicated. They might have been deceived. Now, when they find out, they feel obligated to tell the wife but don't want to out him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't force the married man to cheat. The married man chose to be unfaithful and hide his sexuality. The author's actions in continuing the relationship after finding out the man is married could be seen as wrong because they knew he was cheating. However, the author is trying to do the right thing by considering telling the wife. \n\nThe problem is whether the author should be held responsible for not exposing the cheater. But the author is in a tough spot because outing him could cause family issues. The author is trying to balance two wrongs: keeping the cheating secret vs. outing someone. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the married man is the one who committed adultery and hid his identity. The author was deceived and then faced with a moral dilemma. The author's main mistake might be continuing the relationship once they knew the man was married. But the initial relationship was before they knew. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be partially at fault for continuing the affair once they knew, but the primary responsibility lies with the married man. The author is trying to do the right thing by considering telling the wife, which is a moral action. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
