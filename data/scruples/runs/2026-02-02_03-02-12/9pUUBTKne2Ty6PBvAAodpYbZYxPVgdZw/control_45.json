I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author slept with someone who's married and gay, and now they're trying to decide whether to expose the cheating husband, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with the married man. The man was in the closet, so they made a pact of secrecy. But then the author found out he's cheating on his wife. The moral dilemma is whether to tell the wife, even if it out him. \n\nSo, the author's actions: they had consensual relationships, then found out it's a marriage, so they're complicit in the cheating. But they didn't know he was married at the time. The question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nLegally, the author isn't the one who committed adultery; the married man did. But ethically, the author is involved in the affair. However, if they didn't know about the marriage initially, maybe that's a factor. But they did have multiple encounters after knowing he was married? Wait, no, the user says they found out a week ago. Wait, wait, the timeline: the first time was at the wedding, then five more times after. The author found out a week ago that he's married. So, they continued the relationship after knowing? Wait, the user says they confronted him after finding out a week ago. Wait, the user says they found out a week ago, confronted him, he cried, etc. So, prior to that, did they know he was married? Probably not. So they had relationships without knowing he was married. Once they found out, they confronted him. So the author's actions up to that point involved participating in an extramarital affair. That's one part.\n\nNow, the dilemma is whether to tell the wife. The author wants to protect the man's secret (his sexuality) but also think the wife deserves to know about the cheating. The user is asking if they'd be in the wrong if they exposed the cheating, which would out him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from the start, the author was involved in an affair. That's a factor. But the user is now considering exposing the husband's infidelity. If the author tells the wife, they are taking a stand against infidelity, but it out the husband. However, the husband was already cheating, which is wrong. The author is in a tricky spot because they were part of the affair but now want to do the right thing by the wife.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being part of the affair? Yes, because they knew he was married after the first time? Wait, no, they found out a week ago. So initially, they didn't know he was married. So their first encounter was at the wedding, where he was married but the author didn't know. Then continued the relationship, not knowing he was married. Once they found out, they confronted him. So, they were part of an affair without knowing the man was married. Once they found out, they stopped and are considering exposing him.\n\nSo, the author's wrongness would be in participating in the affair once they knew he was married. But according to the story, they found out later. So prior to finding out, they didn't know. After that, they might have stopped. So their role in the affair was before knowing, which isn't their fault. Then, the dilemma is about whether to expose him. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author is considering telling the wife, which would out him, but they are trying to do the right thing by the wife, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the author was involved in the affair, so they might be complicit. But the user is asking if they're in the wrong now, in the act of deciding to expose the cheater. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's decision to expose the cheater is wrong. If they do it, they're taking a stand against infidelity, but outing someone's sexuality. However, the husband is already cheating, which is a separate issue. The author's actions in the past were wrong (sleeping with a married man), but now they're trying to correct that by informing the wife. So maybe they're not in the wrong now. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong for being part of the affair in the first place. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The main act in question is whether they're in the wrong for exposing the cheater (which would out him). If they do that, they're doing a good deed for the wife but a bad one for the husband. However, the author's initial involvement in the affair makes them complicit. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong for being part of the affair, but the current decision to expose him is a separate matter. The user is asking if they'd be in the wrong for exposing him. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing for the wife, even if it means outing the husband. The answer would depend on cultural context and personal ethics. But according to the options given, answer A is yes (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nConsidering all factors, the author was involved in an extramarital affair, which is morally wrong. But the current act of considering to expose the cheater is an attempt to rectify their mistake. However, the act of exposing could be seen as the right thing to do for the wife, but the initial affair is the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong now. The user is asking if they'd be in the wrong for exposing the cheater. \n\nIf the author is in the wrong for being part of the affair, then the answer is A. If the current act is not wrong, then B. The question is phrased as \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" So, considering the entire situation, including their past actions, are they in the wrong? The author's actions in the past (sleeping with a married man) are wrong. But the current dilemma is about whether they're in the wrong for exposing him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. \n\nThe answer would likely be A (yes, in the wrong) because their initial actions were wrong. However, the user might be asking if the act of exposing is wrong. If the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being in the affair, the answer is yes. But the phrasing of the question is a bit ambiguous. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong in the entire situation, which includes both being part of the affair and the decision to expose. \n\nBut the initial question is \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" The situation includes both their actions and their current dilemma. So, considering all aspects, the author was wrong to be part of the affair, so they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
