I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with a married man who is in the closet about being gay. The key points are: the author knew the man was in the closet and agreed not to out him, then found out he's married and had an affair. Now they're considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him, but are conflicted about whether that's right.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had a sexual relationship with someone who is married. That's cheating, regardless of the circumstances. The man was in the closet, but the author still chose to engage in an affair. So, the author is complicit in the infidelity. \n\nThe man's situation is complex\u2014he's married, cheating, and in the closet. The author might feel conflicted because they care about him and don't want to out him, but they also want to inform the wife. However, the author's initial decision to have an affair is problematic. They didn't know he was married at the time, but after finding out, continuing the relationship shows they were aware and still participated in the cheating. \n\nThe moral dilemma here is whether the author should expose the cheater. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's actions contributed to the cheating, so they are at fault. Even if they want to do the right thing by telling the wife, their initial choice to be part of the affair makes them complicit. \n\nAdditionally, outing someone without consent is a serious violation, but in this case, the author is considering it to expose the cheating. However, the fact that they were involved in the affair themselves complicates their position. They can't claim moral high ground here. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair, regardless of their intentions to later expose the cheater. Their actions facilitated the cheating, and they should take responsibility for that. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
