I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The man asked them not to tell anyone because he's not ready to come out. Now, the author found out he's married with kids and feels guilty. They want to tell the wife but are conflicted because it would out him, possibly causing family issues.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author is in a moral dilemma. On one hand, cheating is wrong, and the wife has a right to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent is a serious violation of privacy, especially if the person's family might not accept their sexuality.\n\nThe author's actions: They had multiple affairs, which is unethical because the man was married. But they did so without knowing he was married. However, that doesn't excuse the affair once they found out. The question is about whether exposing him is wrong.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they're reporting a cheater, which could be seen as doing the right thing. But the method involves outing him, which he explicitly asked not to happen. So, there's a conflict between the husband's right to privacy (as a closeted gay man) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering this? Well, they were part of the affair, which is on them. But when it comes to exposing him, it's a tough call. The author might feel they have a duty to the wife, but outing someone without their consent is a big deal. Also, the man might have other reasons for staying closeted, maybe to protect his kids or family. The author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife, but the means could harm the man's relationships and mental health.\n\nThe author did ask around to see how the family would react, which shows they're trying to be considerate. But there's no clear way to inform the wife without outing him. Maybe there's a way to anonymously inform her, but that's uncertain. If they do tell, they're violating the man's privacy, but if they don't, the wife remains in the dark.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for having a moral dilemma. The question is about whether their action (exposing him) is wrong. If they decide to go through with it, they're breaching confidentiality, which is ethically questionable. But if they choose not to, they might be enabling the cheating. It's a tough spot. However, the initial affair was their mistake. So, the author's wrongness isn't just about the exposure but also about the affair itself. But the question is specifically about the exposure part. \n\nIn ethical terms, the right to privacy is significant. The author promised not to out him, so breaking that promise could be considered wrong. However, the wife's right to know about the infidelity is also important. There's no clear answer, but I think the author isn't in the wrong for considering it, given the circumstances. They're trying to do the right thing despite the complexity. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
