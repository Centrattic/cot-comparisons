I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which could out him as gay. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The man asked not to be outed. The author is now conflicted between telling the wife about the cheating and not outing him, which could cause family issues.\n\nThe main points here are consent and betrayal. The author slept with someone who was married, which is cheating. The author is aware of this and feels guilty. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose this.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel they have a duty to the wife to inform her about the infidelity. However, the act of sleeping with a married person is a violation of trust, and the author is also part of the cheating scenario. \n\nOn the other hand, outing the man could lead to him facing family rejection, which is a serious consequence. The author might be trying to balance two wrongs: the cheating and the outing. But the author's actions also contributed to the cheating.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but ethically, the author's role in the affair is questionable. The author's main dilemma is whether to prioritize the wife's right to know or protect the man's privacy. However, the author's own actions (multiple affairs) are part of the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to involve the wife might be seen as a way to make up for their own actions, but they are still complicit in the cheating. The key issue is that the author is part of the infidelity, so they might be in the wrong for both the affair and the potential exposure. \n\nBut maybe the author's intention is to do the right thing by the wife. However, their own participation complicates things. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were wrong. Since the author was involved in an affair, they have contributed to the cheating. Thus, they might be in the wrong regardless of their intentions.\n"
