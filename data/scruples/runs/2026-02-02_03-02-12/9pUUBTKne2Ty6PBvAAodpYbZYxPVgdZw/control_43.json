I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheating husband, which would out him as gay. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with the married man, not knowing he was married. They were both friends with the author's friend's family. The man is in the closet about his sexuality and asked the author not to tell anyone. The author now knows he's cheating and wants to tell the wife but is conflicted about outing him.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the author's role in the affair and the decision to involve others. Let's break it down. The author had consensual relationships with a married man. That's a problem because he's married, and the author didn't know initially. The author didn't set out to cheat; they were deceived. But the author continued the relationship after finding out he was married, right? Wait, no\u2014wait, the author found out a week ago that he's married. Wait, the timeline is that the author had multiple encounters after the initial one at the wedding, and then later found out he's married. So they had multiple affairs before discovering he's married. That complicates things because the author was in a relationship with someone who was already married, which might make the author complicit to some degree.\n\nBut the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. So the main question is about the author's obligation to the wife versus the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nThe author is torn between telling the wife the truth (which would out him) and keeping the secret. The author also mentions that the man is not the only one he's been with\u2014implying he's cheating on his wife with multiple people. The wife has a right to know, but outing the man could cause family issues.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was a participant in the affair. If the author had known he was married, they wouldn't have continued. But they did continue. So perhaps the author is partially responsible. However, the man was hiding his marriage and his sexuality. The author didn't know and was misled.\n\nNow, the author's dilemma is whether to inform the wife, which would involve outing him. If the author does that, they might be breaking a confidence the man placed in them. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the method of informing the wife could vary. The author could tell the wife without explicitly outing him, but that's complicated. The author might not have the right to interfere in someone else's marriage, but there's an ethical obligation to the wife.\n\nAlternatively, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect the man's privacy, but if the wife is being cheated on, the author might have a duty to inform her. However, the author isn't the one who's wronged the wife; the husband is. The author's participation in the affair is another layer. So the author might be in the wrong for engaging in the affair in the first place, but the question is specifically about exposing the cheater, which would out him.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is caught between two wrongs. The husband is the one who is cheating and hiding his sexuality. The author is trying to decide whether to prioritize the husband's privacy or the wife's right to know. Legally, the author isn't obligated to do either, but morally, it's a tough spot. The author might be in the wrong for participating in the affair, but the act of exposing the cheater could be seen as trying to make amends. However, outing the man could be harmful, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not doing it, but also not in the wrong for considering it.\n\nOverall, the author's main issue is being part of the affair without knowing the man was married. That's a mistake. But the act of considering exposure is a moral dilemma. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for considering it because they're trying to right a wrong done to the wife, but the act of exposing could be problematic. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was part of the cheating, they have some responsibility. However, the primary wrongdoer is the husband. The author's responsibility is more about informing the wife. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) for the act of considering exposure, but they are in the wrong for being part of the affair. But the question is specifically about the exposure part. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. The answer could be B because the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it's a tough call. Alternatively, they are in the wrong for not staying out of it. It's a tough call. The correct answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to inform the wife, which is a moral obligation, even if it's a complex situation.\n"
