I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man, who is married and has kids. The man is in the closet and asked the author not to tell anyone. The author found out about the marriage and the kids, and now wants to tell the wife but is conflicted about outing him.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong to consider exposing the cheater, which would out him. Let me think about the ethical aspects here. \n\nOn one hand, the man cheated, which is a serious betrayal for his wife. The wife has a right to know about her husband's infidelity. But the author is also considering outing him as gay, which is a personal choice and part of his identity. The man's parents are not accepting, so outing him could cause family issues. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot because they care about the man's well-being and don't want to cause harm. However, the author also feels a moral obligation to tell the wife. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it out him.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between the right to privacy and the duty to prevent harm. The author might argue that the wife's right to know about the cheating is more important than keeping the man's secret. But outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if it's not their choice to come out yet. \n\nHowever, the author is not the one who cheated. They were deceived, and they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. The author didn't know about the marriage at first, so their initial relationship wasn't consensual because the man was married. \n\nThe key here is whether the author has a responsibility to intervene. Some might say yes, because the wife is being wronged, while others might say the author isn't responsible enough to act. But the author is trying to navigate this carefully, considering both the wife's rights and the man's privacy. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to correct a wrong done by the man. The man's choice to be deceptive and cheat is the root issue. The author's intention to inform the wife is about preventing further harm, even if it means outing him, because the cheating is the bigger issue here. The author is also trying to find a way to do it without causing unnecessary harm, which shows consideration. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
