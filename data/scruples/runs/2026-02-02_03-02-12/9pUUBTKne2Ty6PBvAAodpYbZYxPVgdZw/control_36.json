I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sleeping with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The key points here are the author's responsibility, the potential consequences of exposing the cheater, and the ethical considerations involved.\n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man, which they later found out was an act of cheating on his wife. The man is in a heterosexual marriage but is gay and closeted. The author is now conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, knowing that this would also out him as gay, which could lead to family issues given his parents' likely conservative stance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater? The main factors to consider are the author's role in the situation. They were aware they were having an affair with a married man, which is generally considered unethical and often illegal. The fact that he's in the closet adds another layer, but the author chose to engage in a relationship knowing he was married. \n\nThe author's dilemma is about whether to inform the wife. While the wife has a right to know about the infidelity, the method of informing her would involve outing him, which could have severe personal consequences for him. However, the author's own actions in the affair might make them complicit in the cheating. \n\nLegally, cheating is not a criminal offense, but ethically, the author is part of the problem. The question is whether they have a moral obligation to the wife. The author might argue that they're trying to do the right thing by protecting the wife, but their initial decision to engage in the affair is problematic. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's intention to expose the cheater is justified despite their own role in the situation. Since the author was involved in an affair with a married person, they are partly at fault. However, their intention to inform the wife could be seen as trying to correct their mistake. \n\nBut the key point is that the author was complicit in the cheating by participating in the affair. Therefore, they are in the wrong for both the affair and the dilemma of exposing the cheater, regardless of intent. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
