I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the author had multiple affairs with a married man who is also gay and closeted. The author found out the man is married and now is considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author met the man at a wedding, had a sexual relationship, and the man was explicit about not wanting to be outed. The author agreed but later discovered the man is married. Now, the author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nLegally, cheating is not illegal, so the author isn't breaking any laws by revealing the affair. However, the author is considering outing the man, which could have significant personal consequences for him, especially given his family's potential reaction. The author is also concerned about being a cheater themselves, having been cheated on before. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. The man is in a committed relationship and has been unfaithful, which is a betrayal of trust. The wife has a right to know because she's being deceived. However, by revealing the affair, the author would also be revealing the man's sexual orientation without his consent, which invades his privacy. The man might have his reasons for staying closeted, such as family disapproval or other consequences. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as a breach of confidentiality. The man trusted the author not to out him, and the author used that trust for their own relationship, then is now considering violating that trust again. Even if the reason is to inform the wife, the method involves outing him, which complicates things. \n\nBut the author might argue that the wife's right to know is more important than the man's desire to stay closeted. However, outing someone is generally considered a serious violation of privacy and autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but the means of doing so by outing the man could be problematic. \n\nAlternatively, the author could consider other ways to inform the wife without revealing the man's sexuality, like contacting her through legal or appropriate channels, but that might not be feasible. The author is in a tough spot between two wrongs. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is not the one who cheated, but they did participate in a relationship knowing the man was married. However, the main issue here is the decision to expose the man's affair while outing him. The author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife, but the method is questionable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author proceeds to tell the wife and out the man, they might be violating his privacy. However, if they do nothing, the wife remains deceived. The author's situation is complex. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A because the author agreed to keep the man's secret and now is breaking that trust. But if the author is trying to correct a wrong by informing the wife, maybe they are not in the wrong. \n\nBut legally and morally, breaching confidentiality in this context could make the author at fault. The author's actions could lead to harm for the man, even if intended to help the wife. So, the answer could be A. Alternatively, since the author is trying to expose infidelity, maybe B. But the act of outing someone without consent is generally considered wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
