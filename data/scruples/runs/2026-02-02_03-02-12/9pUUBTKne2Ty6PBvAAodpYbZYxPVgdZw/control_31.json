I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet about being gay. They had multiple encounters, and now the author is conflicted between exposing the cheater (the man) to his wife and not outing him, which could harm his family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man is married, cheating, and in the closet. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. The man asked the author to keep his sexuality a secret. Now the author knows about the marriage and the cheating and is torn between informing the wife (which would out him) and keeping silent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet's break it down. The author was in a relationship with a married man without knowing he was married. That's a key point. The man lied about his marital status. The author might have been deceived here. But the author also didn't check into his background, perhaps? If they had known he was married, they wouldn't have continued. However, the man was married and had children, so his deception is significant.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing him to the wife, which would out him as gay. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nEthically, cheating is generally considered wrong, so the man is at fault here. The author was a participant in the affair but was misled. The author's intention to tell the wife is to right a wrong (cheating), but doing so would out him, which could have serious consequences for him and his family. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it out him? Or is the man the one at fault, and the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife? \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were deceived. However, by engaging in the affair, they were complicit in the cheating. But the key issue is whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the man. If the author is trying to inform the wife, which is a valid action given the betrayal, but it would out him, the ethical dilemma is complex. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the man is the one who cheated and lied. The author was a victim of deception. However, by continuing the relationship after knowing the man was in the closet (though not knowing he was married), maybe the author shares some responsibility. But the main issue is the cheating. \n\nThe author is trying to decide between two wrongs: outing someone's sexuality or allowing the wife to be cheated on. The author's intention is to stop the cheating, which is morally right, but the method involves outing him. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the wrong here is the man's cheating. The author is trying to correct that, which could be seen as right. However, outing someone without their consent is a serious matter. But the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is trying to inform the wife to stop the cheating but it results in outing him, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the primary wrong was the man's infidelity. The author's action is to address the infidelity, which is the greater wrong. However, the act of outing someone is a violation of their privacy, which is also a serious issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is trying to do the right thing by exposing the cheating, even if it out the man, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. The man is the one who committed the infidelity and lied. The author's action is a consequence of that man's actions. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong because they were part of the affair, which is a form of cheating. So their participation could be a moral failing. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing him. \n\nThe key here is that the author is trying to address the man's infidelity. If the author does expose him, it's to inform the wife, which is a valid action. The fact that it out him is a consequence, but the author's intent is to stop the cheating. So the author's action is in response to the man's wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The man is the one who is in the wrong for cheating and lying. The author is trying to correct that, even if it has side effects."
