I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author had a series of affairs with a married man who is also gay and closeted. The author now wants to expose the man's cheating by informing his wife, which would also out him to her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They had consensual relationships with someone who was married, which is cheating. The man was honest about being gay but not out, and the author promised not to out him. However, the author is now considering breaking that promise to tell the wife about the infidelity, which would reveal his sexuality.\n\nLegally, in many places, cheating isn't a criminal act, but ethically, it's about the agreements and trust between people. The author was aware that the man was married but chose to continue the relationship, which is morally questionable. The man might have been in the wrong by cheating, but the author also participated in the affair. \n\nNow, the author wants to inform the wife. The dilemma is between the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. If the author reveals the cheating, they are outting the man, which was a promise they made. However, the wife deserves to know about the betrayal. But the author's own actions in participating in the affair could be seen as part of the problem. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The main issue is that the author engaged in the affair, which is a breach of trust with the man's wife. By continuing the relationship despite knowing he was married, the author contributed to the situation. However, the author is now trying to right a wrong by informing the wife. But the act of outing the man, despite the wife's right to know, violates the confidentiality the author had agreed to. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They are partly responsible for the affair, and now their solution involves breaking a promise to the man. While the wife has a right to know, the author's method of informing her (which outts the man) might be ethically problematic. The author should consider if there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, perhaps through a third party or a letter. But given the actions taken, the author is complicating the situation by their own participation. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they initiated and continued the affair, and now their attempt to correct it by outing the man breaches the trust they had with him. They should have considered the consequences before engaging in the relationship.\n"
