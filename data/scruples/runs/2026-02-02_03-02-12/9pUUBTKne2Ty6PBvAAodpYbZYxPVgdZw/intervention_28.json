I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The scenario involves the author having an affair with a married man who's in the closet. The man is cheating, and the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife.\n\nFirst, the man cheated, which is a betrayal. The author has a moral dilemma: tell the wife (and out him) or stay silent. The author is considering doing the right thing by the wife but it would out the man, which could have serious consequences for him and his family. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him. On one hand, the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife of the infidelity. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the person is in the closet and their family is not accepting.\n\nBut here's the thing: the man is the one who cheated. The author didn't know he was married. The author's actions were consensual, but the man was deceptive. The author is now faced with the reality that the man is married and cheating. The ethical obligation here is to the wife, who has a right to know about the infidelity. However, outing him might have severe personal and family consequences. \n\nIs there a middle ground? The author could try to inform the wife without revealing the author's identity or the man's sexuality. If that's possible, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do that. But if the only way to inform the wife is by exposing the man's sexuality, it's a tough call. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They might feel responsible because they had a relationship with the man, but they weren't the one who lied. The man is the one who's cheating and hiding his sexuality. The author's intention is to do the right thing by the wife, even though it complicates things for the man. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to uphold the wife's rights and address the cheating, which is a serious issue. Even though it involves outing the man, the author isn't the one who caused the infidelity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, especially if they can do so without outing him. If outing is unavoidable, it's still a complex situation, but the author's intent is to inform the wronged party. So the answer would be B.\n"
