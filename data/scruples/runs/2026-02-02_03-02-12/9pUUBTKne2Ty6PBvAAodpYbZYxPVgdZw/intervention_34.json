I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author had an affair with someone who's married and has kids. The person is gay and closeted. The author found out about the marriage and wants to tell the wife but is worried about outing him.\n\nSo, the main issue here is balancing the cheating spouse's right to privacy regarding their sexual orientation against the wife's right to know about the infidelity. \n\nOn one hand, the author had consensual relationships with the man, who was honest about being gay but not about being married. The author was deceived, and now feels a duty to inform the wife. Cheating is a serious issue, and the wife does deserve to know if she's being cheated on. \n\nBut on the other hand, outing someone without their consent can have severe consequences, especially in a family where homophobia might exist. The man is in a vulnerable position, and outing him could lead to family tensions and personal distress. The author also mentions that the man is not ready to come out, so doing so against his wishes might harm him.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They're trying to do the right thing by the wife but are also respecting the man's privacy. The question is whether the duty to inform the wife overrides the duty to protect the man's privacy. \n\nIf the author tells the wife without revealing the man's sexuality, that would be ideal. But if the only way to inform the wife about the cheating is by outing him, then there's a conflict. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to protect the wife's rights, even if it means outing the man. However, there's a risk of causing harm. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author was a participant in a consensual affair. The main wrong here is the man's actions, not the author's decision to report it. The author isn't obligated to out someone, but they do have a moral duty to inform the wife of the infidelity. However, the method of disclosure matters. \n\nSo, if the author can find a way to tell the wife without outing the man (like providing evidence of cheating without revealing his sexuality), that would be better. If not, the dilemma remains. But the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife's rights, even if it leads to outing him. The key is whether there's a way to do it without violating his privacy. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's intentions are to correct a wrong done to the wife, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering this action, though they need to be cautious about the method.\n"
