I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who had a sexual relationship with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The author is now conflicted about whether to expose the man's cheating, which would also out him as gay, potentially causing family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The author had a consensual relationship, right? But the man was married and not truthful about his relationship status. So he's the cheater here. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. That's a key point. The author might be feeling guilty because they had a relationship with someone who's cheating, but they didn't know about the marriage initially. \n\nThe man also asked the author to keep his sexuality a secret, which the author agreed to. Now, after finding out he's married, the author is wondering if they should tell his wife, which would involve outing him. The dilemma is between protecting someone's privacy (the man's sexuality) and informing someone who's been cheated on (the wife).\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, so the author isn't breaking any laws here. But morally, is the author wrong? The author was deceived by the man. The man lied about his relationship status. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair, so they weren't intentionally cheating on someone else. The author might not be in the wrong for having the relationship, but they are now in a position where they might feel responsible for the wife knowing the truth.\n\nHowever, outing someone without their consent is a serious issue, especially when it could affect their family and possibly their job or social standing. The author might be torn between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, which would out him. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI think the key here is that the author wasn't the one who cheated. The man was the one who lied and had a secret marriage. The author's mistake might have been not doing enough to verify his relationship status, but they were deceived. So, if the author decides to inform the wife, that's ethically complicated, but the author themselves isn't in the wrong for the situation leading up to it. They were in a relationship with someone who was unfaithful and closeted. The author's dilemma is about the next step, but the initial actions don't make them morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
