I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sleeping with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, and the author is conflicted about whether to expose him, which would out him as gay, or keep quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author was in a relationship with the man, knowing he was married but not aware he was gay at first. Now, they found out he's married and cheating, and the author wants to tell the wife. But doing so would out him. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. The man is in a difficult position, possibly under pressure from family expectations, and outing him might have serious consequences for him and his family.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel a duty to the wife, as she's being cheated on. However, the author also made a promise of confidentiality to the man. Breaking that promise by telling the wife could be seen as violating trust. But the author's own actions (sleeping with a married man) might also be considered unethical, which complicates things.\n\nThe key factors here are consent, deceit, and the author's responsibility. The man was deceptive about his relationship status, which is a betrayal. The author, however, was also complicit in the affair. But the author's intention now is to expose the cheating, which is a separate issue. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially outing someone to protect another. In many ethical frameworks, respecting someone's autonomy and privacy is important. However, when someone is being harmed (the wife), there's a duty to intervene. \n\nThe author's decision could be seen as a conflict between two wrongs: the man's infidelity and the author's potential violation of his privacy. But the author's intent is to right a wrong (informing the wife) by another wrong (outing him), which doesn't necessarily justify the action.\n\nConsidering the scenario, the author's actions might be ethically complex. While the man's infidelity is a serious issue, the author's decision to expose him could lead to significant harm, especially given his family's potential reaction. The author's own role in the affair also raises questions about their judgment and responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to inform someone of being cheated on, but the method (outing a closeted gay man) introduces other ethical concerns. However, the author's own involvement in the affair complicates the moral standing. The answer depends on weighing the harm of the infidelity against the harm of outing. In this case, the author's intent is to prevent ongoing harm to the wife, but the means could be questionable. Given these factors, I'd lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
