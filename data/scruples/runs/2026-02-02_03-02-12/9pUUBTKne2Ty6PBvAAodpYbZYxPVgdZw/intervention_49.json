I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The situation is complex with multiple layers. \n\nFirst, the author slept with a man who is married and secretly gay, and the author found out about the marriage later. The man made the author promise not to tell anyone, but now the author is conflicted because the wife has a right to know about the cheating.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality vs. the wife's right to know. The author was a party to the cheating, so there's a moral obligation to inform the wife. However, doing so would out the man, which he isn't ready for. The author is trying to navigate this without causing more harm.\n\nThe man is in a closeted situation, perhaps due to family pressures. The author doesn't want to cause family issues. But the wife deserves to know about the infidelity. However, the author isn't the one who can directly inform the wife without outing the husband, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author at fault for wanting to do the right thing by the wife but respecting the man's privacy? The initial act of sleeping with the man was a mistake, but the author is now trying to rectify it. The dilemma is about balancing two wrongs: cheating and outing. However, the author isn't the one who cheated; they were part of the infidelity but might not be morally responsible for the cheating itself if they didn't know about the marriage at the time.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method is problematic. Maybe there's a way to report the cheating without outing him, like through a mediator or anonymous means. But the author might not have that option here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, which would out him. If the author proceeds, they might be violating the man's privacy, but the wife's rights are also a factor.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, given the circumstances. But they need to consider the consequences of outing him. The answer might hinge on whether the author is obligated to the wife versus respecting the man's confidentiality. Given the context, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
