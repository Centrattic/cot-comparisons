I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would involve outing him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who is married and not out as gay. The author found out about the cheating and the husband's sexuality. Now, they're torn between exposing him to his wife (which would out him) or keeping it secret to avoid family drama.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is generally considered wrong, but the husband is in a closeted situation. The author is concerned about outing him, which can be a serious issue depending on the family's views. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know if she's being cheated on. \n\nBut wait, the author also had a consensual relationship with the husband. They might be complicit in the cheating. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose him. The key factors are the duty to inform the wife versus respecting the husband's privacy. \n\nIf the author didn't know he was married initially, maybe there's some blame there, but they were misled. However, continuing the relationship after knowing he's married makes them complicit. But the main issue is their decision to tell the wife. \n\nOuting someone without consent can be harmful, but the wife's right to know her spouse's infidelity is also important. There's a conflict here. The author's intention might be to do the right thing, but the method (outing) complicates it. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering both the cheating and the outing, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, but the situation is complex. However, the author's own role in the cheating could be a factor. But since the user is asking if they are in the wrong for considering the expose, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as they're trying to address a wrong done. But there's a nuance here.\n"
