I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a complicated situation where they had a sexual relationship with someone they found out is married and cheating. The person is also gay and in the closet. The author is considering exposing the cheater to his wife but is worried about outing him, which could cause family issues.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They had consensual relationships with someone who was already in an intimate relationship. That's cheating and morally questionable, but the question is about the author's current dilemma. The main issue now is whether to inform the wife about the infidelity, which would out the husband as gay.\n\nThe author is conflicted between protecting his privacy and the wife's right to know. The husband is in a committed marriage (legally) and has children. Cheating is a serious breach, and the wife deserves to know the truth about her marriage. However, outing someone without their consent can have severe consequences, especially if the family isn't accepting of being gay.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author is the one who was cheated on as well. They didn't know the husband was married when they started the relationship. The author's mistake was not verifying the husband's relationship status before engaging. Now, they're trying to do the right thing by involving the wife, even though it means outing him. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to expose the cheater? Well, the author isn't directly responsible for the husband's infidelity, but they did engage in a relationship they knew was unethical. However, their intent now is to inform the wife, which is a moral action. The dilemma is about the method\u2014outing versus a way to inform without revealing his sexuality. \n\nIf the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing the husband, that would be ideal. But given the circumstances, outing might be the only way. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife's rights, even if it means causing the husband some distress. The husband made choices to hide his sexuality and cheat, which are his own moral failures. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to correct a mistake and protect another party. The answer should be B.\n"
