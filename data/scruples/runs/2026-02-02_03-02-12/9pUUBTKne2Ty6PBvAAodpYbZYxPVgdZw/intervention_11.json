I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheating husband by outing him as gay. The scenario involves a complex web of relationships and moral dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with a married man who is also gay and closeted. He was aware of the man's marital status but didn't know he was married until later. Now, the author wants to inform the wife about the infidelity but is concerned about outing him, which could lead to family tensions. The key question is whether the author's intention to expose the cheater, despite the consequences of outing him, is morally wrong.\n\nThe author is conflicted between protecting the husband's privacy and informing the wife. The husband is in a harmful situation, cheating on his wife, which is a betrayal. The author's decision to come forward is driven by the wife's right to know she's been cheated on. However, outing the husband without his consent is a violation of his privacy and could cause personal and familial distress. \n\nMoral dilemmas like this often have no clear right or wrong answer. If the author's primary goal is to inform the wife about the infidelity, that's a valid concern because the wife deserves to know. But the method of disclosure\u2014outing the husband\u2014introduces another layer of complexity. The author might be in the right in wanting the wife to know the truth, but the act of outing could be harmful. However, in this case, the author is not just outing the husband for no reason; it's a byproduct of exposing the infidelity. \n\nConsidering the consequences, the author didn't ask for the relationship and only discovered the infidelity later. The man's actions (cheating and being closeted) led to the situation. The author's intention to protect the wife's rights might outweigh the potential harm of outing the husband, especially if the husband is already in a deceptive relationship. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author is caught in a difficult situation where the primary wrongdoer is the cheating husband. The author's intent is to inform the wife, which is a moral obligation, even if it inadvertently out the husband. The key is that the author's action is a response to the husband's betrayal, not a malicious act against him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering this course of action.\n"
