I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person in question is a 20-year-old man who had a series of sexual encounters with a 23-year-old married man. The married man is gay, in the closet, and has two kids with his wife. The author found out the man is married and has been cheating, which upsets the author because he's been cheated on before. Now he's torn between exposing the cheater to his wife (which would out him as gay) or keeping quiet to avoid causing family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author had a consensual relationship with the married man, who was already cheating. The married man asked the author not to out him, which the author agreed to initially. But now the author is considering telling the wife, which would out the man. \n\nThe author's dilemma is between the cheater's right to privacy (and his family's reaction to him being gay) versus the wife's right to know she's been cheated on. But wait, the author wasn't in a relationship with the wife; he's a third party. The main issue here is whether he has a moral obligation to inform the wife about the infidelity. \n\nHowever, there's a problem here. The author wasn't in a relationship with the married man's wife, so technically, he's not her partner. The obligation to inform might lie with the married man himself, not the author. But the author feels a sense of obligation because he knows the truth. \n\nBut does the author have the right to expose someone else's infidelity, especially when it involves outing the man as gay? That could cause significant personal and familial harm. The author's actions might be seen as violating his confidentiality, even if the married man was wrong to cheat. \n\nAlso, the author was aware from the start that the married man was hiding his sexuality and agreed not to out him. The author might have crossed a line by continuing the relationship knowing the man was married. But now, by considering exposing the cheating, he's adding another layer of complexity. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's a participant in the affair, so he's complicit. But the main question is about the current dilemma. If he tells the wife, he's breaching the confidentiality he promised the man, which could cause harm. If he doesn't, the wife remains deceived. However, the author isn't in a position to enforce moral obligations on someone else's spouse. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's initial actions (having an affair) are questionable, but the current issue is about his next step. The decision to expose the cheating could be seen as a moral act because the wife has a right to know, but doing so by outing the man (which he promised not to do) complicates things. There's no straightforward answer here. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he chooses to expose the cheating, he's breaking his promise to the man, which could be wrong. If he chooses not to tell, he's allowing the man's cheating to continue, but maybe that's not his place to intervene. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, the person who is directly wronged (the wife) has the right to know. But the author isn't the one who committed the betrayal; the married man did. The author's role is as a third party. So, stepping in to inform the wife might not be his responsibility. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong if he decides to expose the cheater because he's breaching confidentiality and possibly causing harm beyond the immediate issue of infidelity. Alternatively, if he does nothing, he's enabling the cheater. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation as presented. \n\nGiven all that, the answer depends on whether the author's actions of exposing the cheating (and outing the man) are justified. Since he's a third party and not directly responsible for the cheating, but he's involved in the affair, it's a complex scenario. However, the act of exposing someone's infidelity without their consent could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it out them. So the author might be in the wrong if he goes ahead with exposing it, because he's violating the trust he agreed to. So the answer is A.\n"
