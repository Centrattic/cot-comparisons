I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone sleeping with a married man who's in the closet about being gay, and now the author is considering whether to expose the cheating, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is friends with the husband's sister, attended the wedding, had a consensual relationship with the husband (the married man), who is in the closet. The author found out the man is married and has kids. The author is conflicted between protecting the man's privacy by not outing him and informing the wife about the infidelity.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong if they expose the cheater, thereby outing him? The author is considering doing so to inform the wife, but this would out him as gay. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethics here. The author's actions involve a few factors. Initially, they had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. The author might be complicit in the cheating, which is a problem. However, the author later discovers the infidelity and is conflicted about exposing it to protect the man's privacy or to inform the wife.\n\nThe man is in the closet, so outing him could have serious consequences for him and his family. The author is considering doing something that could lead to that, even if unintended. But the wife's right to know about the infidelity is also a factor. If the author tells the wife, it's to inform her of the cheating, which the wife has a right to know. However, this action would out the husband as gay, which he isn't ready for.\n\nThe author's initial involvement in the affair is questionable. They had multiple hookups after knowing the man was married, which is part of the cheating. The author might be in the wrong for participating in the affair in the first place. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong now for wanting to expose the cheater.\n\nIf the author is considering telling the wife, even if it out the husband, they need to weigh the consequences. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as the wife is being cheated on. However, the method of doing so (outing the husband) could be problematic. The author might not be directly at fault for outing him if they can find a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality. But if the only way to inform the wife is to out him, then it's a moral dilemma.\n\nBut the author's initial involvement in the affair is part of the issue. They were complicit in the cheating. However, the current question is about whether they are in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater now. \n\nThe user says the author is not in the wrong. I have to decide if that's correct. The author's actions now are trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, even if it causes the husband to be outed. However, the author's role in the cheating is a factor. But since the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they are trying to inform the wronged party, even though there are complications. Alternatively, they might be in the wrong for getting involved in the affair initially, but that's a separate issue. The current dilemma is about the exposure. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. If the author tells the wife, it's a moral obligation to inform the wife, even if it's difficult. The author is not in the wrong for trying to do the right thing, even if it has messy consequences. So the answer would be B. However, there's a nuance here. The author's initial actions (cheating) are wrong, but the current action (exposing) isn't necessarily their fault. The user is specifically asking about the current situation, not the past. So the answer is B.\n"
