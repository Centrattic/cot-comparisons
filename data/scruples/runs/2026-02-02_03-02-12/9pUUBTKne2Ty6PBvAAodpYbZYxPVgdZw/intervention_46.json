I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a series of sexual encounters with someone who is married and gay, and now they're conflicted about whether to expose the cheater, which would involve outing him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author was in a non-consensual relationship from the start because the person was married and thus in a committed relationship without the author's knowledge. The man was also hiding his sexuality, which he wanted to keep private. The author didn't know about the marriage and the kids, which complicates things.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing this. If the author decides to tell the wife, that would involve outing the man, which could have serious consequences for him, especially given his family's potential reaction. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. \n\nHowever, the author also had consensual relationships without knowing about the man's marital status, so there's a question of whether the author is partly at fault for not doing more due diligence. But since the man was deceptive about his relationship status and sexuality, the responsibility might not lie entirely with the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering reporting the infidelity, which could be seen as the right thing for the wife to know. But outing someone's sexuality without their consent can be damaging and a violation of privacy. The author has to weigh the harm of the infidelity against the harm of outing someone. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own feelings of guilt and responsibility. They feel obligated to tell the wife but are conflicted about outing the man. This internal conflict shows that the author is trying to do the right thing but is unsure. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but it's a breach of marital trust. However, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the married man did. So the author's role here is more about what to do with the information they have.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they are in a difficult ethical position. However, the act of the author being in the relationship wasn't malicious; they were deceived. So, if the author decides to expose the cheater, they might be doing the right thing for the wife, but they have to consider the consequences of outing someone. If they choose to stay silent, they might be protecting his privacy but allowing the infidelity to continue. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. The initial actions of the author (sleeping with the man) were consensual and based on mutual attraction, though the man was deceptive. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the relationship itself, but the dilemma is about the next step. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to resolve a moral conflict and hasn't acted yet. They are at a crossroads, not having committed a wrongdoing yet, but considering possible actions that have their own moral implications."
