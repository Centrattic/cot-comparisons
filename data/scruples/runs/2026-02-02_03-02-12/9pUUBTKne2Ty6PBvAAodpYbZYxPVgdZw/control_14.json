I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a complex mix of personal relationships, potential cheating, and the dilemma of exposing someone's secrets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the facts. The author, a 20-year-old male, had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher is married, has two kids, and is in the closet. The author found out about the marriage and feels conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out the usher. The author is considering exposing the cheater but is worried about outing him and causing family issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had consensual relationships with a married man who's in the closet. The author now knows he's married and possibly cheating on his wife, and they want to inform the wife but are conflicted about the morality of outing him.\n\nFirst, looking at the author's actions: he had consensual sex with someone who is married. That in itself could be considered morally wrong, depending on the context. However, the usher was in the closet about his sexuality, so perhaps he's in a heterosexual marriage but is having a same-sex relationship. If the husband is not in an open marriage, then he's committing infidelity. But if he's in a same-sex marriage, that's different. The story says he's married to a woman, so he's having a same-sex affair, which is cheating. \n\nThe author's responsibility here is tricky. Once he found out, he confronted the usher, who is struggling with leaving his wife for the kids. Now the author is trying to decide whether to inform the wife, knowing it would out him. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating isn't illegal, so the author isn't breaking any laws. Morally, it's more complicated. The author had a relationship with someone who was married, so he could be seen as enabling the cheating. However, the usher was the one in the wrong for cheating. \n\nThe dilemma now is whether the author has a duty to inform the wife. On one hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. On the other hand, outing the usher could cause family problems and potential harm to his children. The author is in a position where he's trying to balance the wife's right to know with the usher's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author decides to expose the cheater, he's outting him, which could be harmful. But if he doesn't, the wife remains unaware. However, the author also had a relationship with a married man, which is a moral issue regardless of the outcome. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they had consensual sex with someone who was in a committed marriage, which is cheating. So the author could be at fault for participating in the affair. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong now for considering exposing the cheater. \n\nIf the author is considering coming forward, the wrong would be in outing someone without their consent, which could be a violation of their privacy. However, the wife's right to know is also a factor. But the author's initial involvement in the affair might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is at fault for being part of the affair. Since he was part of the cheating, he might be in the wrong. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now regarding the decision to expose. \n\nThe author's current dilemma is about whether to inform the wife. The wrong would be in outing the usher against his wishes, but the author might be justified if the wife has a right to know. However, the initial act of having a relationship with a married person is the primary wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he was part of the cheating relationship. The current decision to expose is a separate issue, but his initial actions make him complicit in the infidelity.\n"
