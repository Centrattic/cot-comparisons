I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they had an affair with a married man who's also closeted. He's a friend's family member, and there's a moral dilemma about whether to expose him to his wife.\n\nFirst, the author is considering exposing the cheater, which would also out him as gay. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for doing that. \n\nThe author's actions were consensual with the man initially, but the man was married and cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage at first, but after learning, they confront him. Now, the conflict is between not outing him (which he wanted) and telling the wife about the infidelity. \n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author's main issue is whether they should break the confidentiality they agreed to. The man asked not to be outed, and the author initially respected that. However, the author is now considering breaking that trust because of the cheating. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong from the start? They had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. However, the man was the one who was already in a married relationship. The author might argue they didn't know, but the key point here is the question of whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose him now. \n\nThe dilemma is between the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. But the author's actions in the affair themselves might be a factor. If they had a consensual relationship without knowing the marriage, maybe they're not at fault. But once they found out, continuing the relationship could be considered wrong. However, that's a separate issue from the current question of whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose him. \n\nThe author is trying to do the right thing by considering telling the wife, even if it out him. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The original question is about the exposure, not the affair itself. So the answer depends on whether the author is justified in exposing him despite the outing. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the act of outing him could be a problem. However, the user is specifically asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which would result in outing him. The answer might depend on cultural or personal moral codes. Since the author has a duty to the wife, perhaps they aren't in the wrong. But if they're violating the man's privacy, they could be. \n\nBut the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be A if the author is wrong to expose a cheater when it leads to outing, or B if they're not. Considering the options, maybe the answer is B because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it's a tough choice. Alternatively, A if they breached confidentiality without a valid reason. \n\nBut in this case, the author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife, which is a valid reason. So maybe B (not in the wrong). However, the act of outing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong, unless there's a compelling reason. Since the author is considering it to prevent cheating, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author had a consensual affair and then is considering exposing the cheater, they might share some responsibility. However, the main issue here is the exposure. The answer could hinge on whether the author is justified in prioritizing the wife's right to know over the man's privacy. \n\nGiven the situation, the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they are trying to act ethically by informing the wronged party, even though it's a difficult decision. But there's a risk of being in the wrong if the author is violating the man's trust. It's a tough call. \n\nBut in the context of the options given, the correct answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are attempting to do the right thing by informing the wife, even if it has consequences for the man's privacy. The act of exposing the cheater is morally justified here, despite the potential to out him. However, the answer might depend on cultural norms. Given the scenario, the answer is B.\n"
