I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a complicated web of relationships and moral dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand with a man who was an usher at a wedding. The man was in the closet, so the author promised not to out him. They became friends and had more encounters. Then the author found out the man is married with two kids and cheating on his wife. Now the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him, or stay silent.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The initial part: the author had consensual sex with someone who was married. That's cheating from the man's side, but the author might not be in the wrong if they didn't know he was married. The problem arises when they found out he's married. The author now has to decide whether to expose the cheating, which would out him as gay, potentially causing family issues.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between protecting the husband's privacy (as he's in the closet) and informing the wife about the infidelity. Legally, cheating isn't a crime, but morally, the author might feel obligated to tell the wife. However, outing someone against their wishes could be considered a violation of their privacy and trust. The author had promised not to out him, so breaking that promise might be wrong. But the wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating, so not telling could also be seen as wrong.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own actions. If the author knew the man was married from the start, that would be different. But since they didn't, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault for the initial relationship. However, continuing the relationship after finding out he's married complicates things. The author might be enabling the cheating, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. If the author decides to tell the wife, they might be justified in wanting to protect the wife's rights. However, the method of telling\u2014without outing him\u2014might be tricky. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without revealing the husband's sexuality, that might be the ethical choice. But if outing is inevitable, then the author is caught between two wrongs.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing by the wife. The husband is the one who cheated and is in the closet. The author's promise to keep it secret was based on the assumption that the relationship was consensual and not harmful. Once the cheating aspect comes into play, the dynamics change. The author might feel a duty to the wife, even if it means breaking the promise to the husband.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial agreement to keep the secret could be seen as a commitment, and breaking it might be a breach of trust. But the husband was the one who was deceptive by not disclosing his marital status. The author's actions were based on incomplete information. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for acting on the new information.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a tough spot, but their intentions to inform the wife could be seen as morally justified, even if it means outing the husband. However, they might be in the wrong if they directly out him without considering the consequences. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether their actions of exposing the cheater (which involves outing) are justified. If the author's primary obligation is to the wife, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if they broke their promise to the husband without a valid reason, they might be. But given the husband's deceit, the author's actions could be seen as necessary. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
