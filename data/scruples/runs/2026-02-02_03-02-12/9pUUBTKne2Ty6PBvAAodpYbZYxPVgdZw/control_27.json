I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for A?) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sleeping with a married man who is also closeted and gay. The key points here are the author's actions and the potential consequences.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. The man is also gay and in the closet, so the author was aware of that and agreed not to out him. However, after finding out about the marriage and the kids, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out the husband.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong, but the author might feel they were deceived since the man was already in a marriage. However, the author initiated the relationship after the fact, so they might be complicit. The dilemma is whether to expose the cheating, which would out the husband's sexuality, or stay quiet.\n\nThe author's options are to either tell the wife (outing him) or not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him. Legally, cheating isn't a crime, but ethically, it's complicated. The author might feel justified in protecting the wife, but outing someone against their wishes is a serious breach of privacy. \n\nThe man was in the closet, and the author had agreed not to out him. By telling the wife, the author is breaking that promise. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author's moral dilemma is between respecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author decides to expose the cheating, they might be right in the wife's eyes but wrong in the man's. Conversely, not telling the wife could be seen as enabling the cheating. The author's actions depend on their perspective on the conflict between the two parties' rights. \n\nSince the author is trying to decide whether they would be in the wrong for taking action, the answer depends on societal norms. Generally, people might judge the author for outing someone, especially if it's against their wishes. However, others might argue that the wife deserves to know. The complexity here makes it a nuanced situation. Given that the author is trying to act in good faith but is causing harm to the husband, it's possible they're not entirely in the wrong, but there are valid arguments on both sides. The answer hinges on whether the act of outing is considered more harmful than the cheating. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife, even with the consequence of outing the husband. But some might argue that the author's actions are in the wrong because they're violating the man's privacy. However, given the cheating aspect, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
