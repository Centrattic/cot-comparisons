I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with a married man who's hiding his sexuality and cheating on his wife. The author found out about the marriage and the kids, and now is conflicted between not wanting to out him (due to his family's potential reaction) and feeling a duty to inform the wife about the infidelity. \n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him as gay? Let's break it down.\n\nThe author had a consensual relationship with the man, who was married. The man was in the closet, and the author promised not to reveal his sexuality. Now, the author is thinking of telling the wife, which would violate that promise. But the wife has a right to know about the cheating. However, outing someone without their consent is generally considered a serious breach of trust, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is being cheated on, which is a valid reason to want to inform her. On the other hand, outing someone can have severe consequences for them, especially in a family that's not accepting. The author is in a difficult position because they care about the man and don't want to cause him harm, but also feel a moral obligation to the wife.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship, but they were aware he was in a closeted situation. The author's initial agreement to keep his sexuality private is important. Now, revealing that information to the wife would mean breaking that promise. Even if the intent is to inform the wife about the cheating, the method involves outing the man, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: Could the author inform the wife without outing the man? Maybe by providing evidence that he's cheating without revealing his sexuality. For example, if there's other evidence of infidelity. But the author mentions the man uses Grindr, which is directly tied to his sexuality. So, it's unclear if there's a way to do that without outing him.\n\nLegally and ethically, while a spouse has a right to know about infidelity, outing someone without their consent is generally frowned upon. The author might be trying to protect the wife's interests, but at the cost of violating the man's privacy. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a line by breaking a promise made in confidence, even if the intention is good.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for planning to expose the man's sexuality to inform the wife. The right course of action might be to find another way to inform the wife without outing him, if possible. But since the author is conflicted and doesn't have a clear path to do that, the act of outing him would be a betrayal of the trust they built with him, making the author at fault.\n"
