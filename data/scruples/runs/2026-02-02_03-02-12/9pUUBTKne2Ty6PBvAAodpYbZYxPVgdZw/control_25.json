I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, a 20-year-old man, had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man who is married and a father. The married man is in the closet and didn't want anyone to know he's gay. The author initially agreed not to tell anyone but later found out the man was married with kids. Now the author is conflicted about exposing the cheating because it would out the man, but he feels the wife has a right to know.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. But he didn't know about the marriage initially. Wait, the user says he found out the man is married. So the author was in a sexual relationship with a married man, which is adultery. But the author didn't know at the time, right? The wedding happened a month ago, and the affair began at the wedding. The married man was the one in the wrong by being unfaithful. The author might feel he was used or deceived.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing the cheating to the wife. But doing so would out the man as gay, which he isn't ready for. The author is aware that the man's family isn't accepting. So there's a conflict between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater? Let's consider the moral implications. The married man is the one who cheated, which is a serious betrayal. The author was his partner in the affair. However, the author was not his wife. The author could argue that he had no obligation to the wife, but he might feel responsible because he was involved in the infidelity.\n\nBut the author is also considering outing someone who asked for secrecy. The man wanted to remain closeted. The author promised not to tell, which he respected initially. Now, breaking that promise could cause significant harm to the man, especially if his family isn't accepting. The author is in a tough spot because he might be trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, but it comes at the cost of outing the man.\n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing him? The author is asking if that's possible. If the author could anonymously inform the wife without revealing his own involvement or the man's sexuality, then maybe that's an option. But if the only way to inform the wife is by revealing the affair, which would out him, then the author has to weigh the consequences.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as trying to set things right, but the method of doing so involves violating someone else's privacy. The man who cheated is the primary wrongdoer here. The author might be trying to rectify his own actions by helping the wife, but he's also complicit in the affair. However, he wasn't aware of the marriage initially and might have a defense there.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he wasn't in a relationship with the wife, so he might not have a direct obligation to her. But he might feel a moral obligation because he was part of the cheating. However, the author's own actions were also ethically questionable. He engaged in a sexual relationship with someone who was married, even if he didn't know at the time. So he's part of the problem as well.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, leading to outing him. The answer depends on the balance between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy. If the author is trying to inform the wife in a way that out the man, he might be causing harm for a perceived good. However, if he's acting in the wife's interest, maybe he's justified. But since the author is also involved in the affair, he might not be the best person to make that decision.\n\nI think the author is in a tough spot, but considering the circumstances, he's not entirely in the wrong. The married man is the one who committed adultery and hid his sexuality. The author's decision to inform the wife, while it out the man, is driven by a sense of justice. However, the wrong here is more on the married man's side. The author's actions are a consequence of his own involvement, but he's trying to make amends. So the answer might be that he's not in the wrong, but there are complexities.\n"
