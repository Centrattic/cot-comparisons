I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The scenario involves the author (20M) having multiple affairs with a married man (23M) who is in the closet. The author now knows the man is cheating on his wife and is conflicted about whether to inform the wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They had consensual relationships with someone who was married, which is cheating. So, the author was part of the infidelity. However, the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him as gay.\n\nThe man is cheating on his wife, and the author is considering telling her to protect her. The dilemma is between the man's right to privacy (being closeted) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are exposing the man's secret (his sexuality and infidelity), which could have serious consequences for him. But the wife has been cheated on, and the author might feel a moral obligation to inform her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to do that? Well, the author was also complicit in the cheating. However, the question is about exposing the cheater, not their own actions. The author's intent is to inform the wronged party (the wife), which is a protective action. But by doing so, they out the man, which could be harmful. \n\nIt's a complex situation. On one hand, the author's own behavior was wrong (cheating), but the question is specifically about the exposure. The author might be trying to correct their mistake by ensuring the wife knows. \n\nThe options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author is trying to inform the wife about the cheating, which is a valid concern, even if it means outing the man. The author's intent is to prevent further harm, which could be seen as morally right. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is problematic. \n\nBut since the man is already cheating, the author might argue that the wife has a right to know. The author's own actions are questionable, but the exposure is a different matter. The answer likely hinges on whether informing the wife justifies outing him. The author is trying to do the right thing for the wife, even if it causes issues for the man. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
