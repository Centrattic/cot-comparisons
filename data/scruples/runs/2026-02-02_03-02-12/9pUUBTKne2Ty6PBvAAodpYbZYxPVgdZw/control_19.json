I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author slept with someone they met at a wedding, who later turned out to be married. The author is now conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out the husband as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the usher had a relationship that the usher was keeping secret because he's in the closet. The author agreed not to out him. But then the author discovers the usher is married and cheating. The author is considering telling the wife but is worried about outing him, which could cause family issues given his parents' conservative views.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author is involved in a cheating situation. They had multiple affairs with a married man. That's a problem because it's infidelity. The author might be in the wrong for participating in the affair, regardless of the usher's situation. Also, the author is considering exposing the usher, which could be seen as a betrayal of the trust they had, even if the usher was the one cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author might feel a moral obligation to inform the wife. However, by doing so, the author would be outing the usher, which he specifically asked not to happen. The author initially promised not to out him, so going against that could be a breach of trust. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the wife's rights. Cheating is a serious issue, and the wife deserves to know. However, the author's role here is complicated because they were part of the affair. The author's actions might have contributed to the situation. \n\nIs there a way to tell the wife without outing the usher? Maybe, but if the author provides the wife with evidence that the husband is cheating, the wife might discover his sexuality through other means, especially if he's on Grindr. So outing might be inevitable. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They have conflicting obligations: their promise to the usher and the wife's right to know. The author's initial decision to engage in the affair could be seen as the first wrong. Participating in an affair is ethically questionable, especially since the usher was married. The author might be in the wrong for starting the relationship in the first place. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the current situation\u2014specifically, whether they are wrong for considering exposing the usher. If the author decides to inform the wife, that might be a separate issue from their initial involvement. \n\nBut the author's initial actions (sleeping with a married man) are problematic. That could be the main issue here. The dilemma about whether to expose the usher is a consequence of that initial wrong. So the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. The subsequent action of considering exposure is a separate decision, but the root issue is the affair itself. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they were involved in an affair, which is a breach of trust and ethical violation. The dilemma about what to do next is a result of that initial mistake.\n"
