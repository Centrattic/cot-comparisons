I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author (a 20-year-old male) had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher was in a closeted marriage, and the author found out he's married with kids. The key points here are: the author didn't know he was married when they started the affair, and the usher is gay but closeted. The author is now deciding whether to expose the cheating husband to his wife, which would out him as gay, and if that's wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a consensual relationship with the married man. They both knew each other's situation? Wait, no. The author didn't know he was married when they started. The usher told him he was gay and closeted, but didn't mention being married. Wait, the author says that after sleeping together, the usher asked him not to tell anyone because he's gay and closeted. So the usher told the author he's gay but didn't mention being married. The author then continued the relationship, not knowing he was married. Then later found out about the marriage and kids.\n\nSo the usher was already in a fraudulent marriage, cheating on his wife, and hiding his sexuality. The author was deceived into having a relationship with someone who was already married, which is a form of infidelity. But the author didn't know about the marriage initially. So the usher is the one who's being dishonest.\n\nNow, the author is now considering telling the wife about the affair, which would out the usher. The author is conflicted between the usher's privacy (not being outed) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, even if it out him? Well, the author was also part of the situation, engaging in an affair. However, the usher was the one in a marriage and cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage, so maybe the usher is the one with more fault in that. But the author is now in a moral dilemma about whether to tell the wife. \n\nIf the author chooses to tell the wife, he's doing it to prevent further harm, but it would out the usher. However, the usher is already cheating, which is a betrayal. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The usher's closeted status complicates things, but the author isn't the one who caused the marriage; the usher did. So maybe the author is not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it out him. The usher is the one in a wrong position here for being married and cheating while closeted. \n\nBut the author was also part of the affair. So does that make the author complicit? Maybe. But the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions could be seen as wrong in that he was involved in an affair with a married man, but he didn't know about the marriage initially. If the usher had been truthful from the start, maybe the author would have known. But the usher was deceptive. \n\nSo the main wrongdoer here is the usher, who's in a fraudulent marriage and cheating. The author is now trying to decide whether to expose the cheater, which is a moral choice. If the author does expose him, he's not necessarily in the wrong because the usher is the one cheating. However, if the author decides not to expose him, that's also a choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering or deciding to expose. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes exposing a cheater is seen as the right thing to do, even if it's uncomfortable. The author's dilemma is between protecting the usher's privacy and the wife's right to know. The answer might depend on cultural or personal morals. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions in the affair might be a factor. However, since the author didn't know about the marriage, maybe the usher is more at fault. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it out him. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
