I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with someone who is married and has kids. They met at a wedding, slept together, and continued seeing each other multiple times. The usher is in the closet and asked the author not to reveal his sexuality, which the author agreed to. Now the author found out the usher is married and wants to inform the wife, but that would out him as gay. They're conflicted because they don't want to cause family issues but also feel the wife has a right to know about the cheating.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author has a moral obligation to expose the cheater, even though it involves outing him. Let's consider the key points. The author was in a consensual relationship with the usher, who is married. The usher is cheating on his wife, which is ethically wrong regardless of his sexuality. The author is now grappling with the consequences of keeping the secret that the husband is cheating versus outing him, which has its own implications.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel responsible because their actions (sleeping with the usher) contributed to the infidelity. But the usher was the one who was already in a committed relationship and chose to be deceptive. The author could argue that they were deceived about the usher's marital status, but that doesn't absolve the usher of his responsibility. However, the author's role is to be honest if they decide to continue the relationship, which they might not. But the author is now considering exposing the usher to the wife, which would out him as gay. \n\nNow, the moral dilemma: Should the author prioritize the wife's right to know about the betrayal or the usher's right to privacy regarding his sexuality? Outing someone is a serious matter, especially if their family is not accepting. But the usher is also committing infidelity, which is a breach of trust. \n\nThe author's position is that they want to do the right thing but are unsure. From an ethical standpoint, there's a conflict between confidentiality (as agreed with the usher) and the duty to inform the wronged spouse. However, the author might be in a difficult spot because they were part of the affair. But if the author is the one who found out the husband's infidelity, their responsibility to the wife versus their promise to the usher is the crux. \n\nAlso, considering the usher's request not to be outed, the author might have promised confidentiality. If they break that, they might be violating a trust. But the wife's right to know her spouse's infidelity is another angle. However, the author's role here is as an accomplice. They were involved in the cheating. If they expose the husband, they might be doing it for the wife's benefit, but it's the husband who is at fault. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they decide to expose the husband (the usher) to the wife, they are outing him, which he didn't want. If they don't, the wife remains unaware. But the author is also part of the cheating. However, the primary responsibility here is to the wife. If the author is an accomplice to the infidelity, they have a duty to warn the wife, but that might require outing the husband. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to inform the wife without outing the husband. For example, the author could tell the wife that her husband is having an affair without revealing the author's identity or the husband's sexuality. However, if the author is the one who is cheating, then maybe they don't have the right to do that because they are also part of the problem. Alternatively, if the author is just an observer and not involved, but in this case, the author is the one who was in the affair. \n\nSo, the author's actions in the affair are problematic. They were involved with a married person, which is cheating. Therefore, they are in the wrong for participating in the infidelity. But the main question is whether exposing the husband makes them wrong. \n\nIn moral terms, if someone is part of a harmful act (cheating), they have a responsibility to address it. However, exposing a cheater often involves complex consequences. The author's dilemma is between upholding the promise of confidentiality and informing the wife. If the author was deceived by the husband about his marital status, that's a different story. But the situation states that the author knew the husband was part of the wedding (as the usher), so maybe they didn't know he was married? Wait, the situation says the author found out the usher is married and has kids. Wait, the original scenario says the usher is married to a woman. The author met him at the wedding, which the usher's wife was out of the country. So the author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the author says, \"I found out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children.\" So the author was unaware of the usher's marital status when they started the affair. That's a key point. If the author didn't know he was married, then the initial actions might be more about the usher's deception. However, once the author found out, they were involved in a relationship with a married person, which is still cheating. The author is now in a position where they have to decide whether to inform the wife. \n\nIf the author wants to inform the wife, they might be trying to correct the wrong done by the usher. But doing so would out him as gay, which he didn't want. The author could be in the wrong for not upholding the confidentiality they promised, but the usher was already in the wrong by being deceptive and cheating. The author is now trying to make amends by exposing the cheating, even if it means outing him. \n\nIn that case, the author's actions in the affair are wrong, but their intention to expose the husband's cheating might be seen as a way to right a wrong. However, the author's initial involvement was based on the usher's lies. So the author is partially at fault, but the main wrongdoer is the usher. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, people have a responsibility to report harmful deceit, especially in cases of infidelity. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of privacy. Since the wife is being cheated on, the author might have a duty to inform her, even if it means outing the husband. But the author was part of the affair, so their role is complicated. \n\nIn summary, the author is in a difficult position. They were deceived initially but are now involved in an affair with a married person. Wanting to inform the wife might be a way to take responsibility, but it's a tough call. Depending on the ethical framework, if the author believes the wife's right to know is more important than the husband's secrecy about his sexuality, then the author might be in the right to expose the affair, even if it leads to outing. However, if they break the confidentiality they promised to the usher, that could be seen as wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they were unaware of the marriage when the affair started, that might mitigate some of their responsibility. But once they found out, continuing the affair makes them complicit. However, the main focus here is on the author's decision to expose the cheater. \n\nThe answer likely depends on the ethical viewpoint. If the author is in the wrong for being part of the affair, but now wants to inform the wife, that's a separate issue. But the question is about the exposure, not the initial affair. However, the user might be implying that the author's entire involvement is putting them in the wrong, which complicates the situation. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which would involve outing him. The answer would be about the exposure decision. If the author is telling the wife about the affair to prevent further harm, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they were complicit in the cheating and now want to shift blame, that's different. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they were part of the affair and now are considering outing the husband, which could cause harm. Alternatively, maybe they're not in the wrong because the husband was the one who cheated. Hmm. The key is that the author is choosing between two wrongs: being complicit in the affair or outing the husband. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. \n\nIf the author's action of exposing the cheater is done to protect the wife, perhaps they're not in the wrong. But if they were part of the affair and then decide to inform the wife, they could be seen as a snitch or complicating the situation. However, the husband is the main wrongdoer here. The author might be trying to correct the harm they were part of. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is probably B (No), because the author is trying to inform the wronged party (the wife) about the infidelity, which is a positive action, even though it involves outing someone. However, the author's initial involvement in the affair might complicate this. But the question is specifically about the exposure, not the entire scenario. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong for being part of the affair in the first place. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for exposing. The user might be asking if the author is morally right to expose, given their own role. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, being an accomplice can give you a responsibility to come clean. So the author might not be in the wrong for exposing to prevent further harm. But the answer could be A because the author is in a situation where they have to break a promise (to the usher) to do the right thing (informing the wife). But promises can be broken if someone is doing significant harm. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for exposing the cheater to the wife, even if it out him. The wrong is on the usher for being deceptive and cheating. The author's intent is to inform the wife, which is ethically sound, even though it's a tough decision.\n"
