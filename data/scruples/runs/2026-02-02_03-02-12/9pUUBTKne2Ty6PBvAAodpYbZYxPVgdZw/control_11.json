I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the original post is wrong (A) or not (B). The scenario involves the author sleeping with a married man who's also in the closet about being gay. The author is considering exposing the cheating to the man's wife but doesn't want to out him, especially since his family might not accept it.\n\nFirst, the author was in a situation where they had a relationship with someone who was married and cheating. They knew he was in the closet. The man lied about his situation and his sexuality. The author now faces a dilemma: report the cheating (which would out him) or stay silent.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between the right of the wife to know she's been cheated on and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality. The author might feel guilt from their own actions, having cheated, but that doesn't negate the wife's right to know. However, outing someone, even if they're cheating, can have serious consequences, especially in a conservative family. \n\nThe key points are: the author had consensual relationships with a married man who was hiding his sexuality. The author now wants to inform the wife, which would out him. The author's actions (sleeping with a married man) were unethical, but the question is about whether they're wrong in considering exposing the cheating. \n\nIf the author is considering exposing the cheating, they might be trying to do the right thing by protecting the wife. However, since doing so would out the man, there's a conflict. The author's own actions (cheating) could be seen as wrong, but the question is whether they're wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be obligated to inform the wife, especially if they were part of the cheating. But if the author believes the wife has a right to know, they might feel compelled. However, outing the man's sexuality isn't the author's place unless there's a legal obligation. \n\nConsidering all that, the author is in a tough spot. Their initial actions (cheating) were wrong, but the question is about their current dilemma. Since the author is conflicted and trying to do the right thing by the wife while respecting the man's privacy, it's not necessarily that they're wrong for wanting to expose the cheating. However, the act of exposing it might involve outing him, which is a serious matter. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their intention to expose the cheater (even if it out him) is justified. Since the wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but the author's method might involve violating the man's privacy, it's a complex situation. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it has consequences. So the answer would be B (No), they are not in the wrong.\n"
