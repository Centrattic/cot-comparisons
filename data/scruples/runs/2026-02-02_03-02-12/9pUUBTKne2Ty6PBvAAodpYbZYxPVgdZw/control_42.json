I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the scenario is caught in a moral dilemma after sleeping with someone who's married and in the closet about his sexuality. The key points here are: they were in a non-consensual relationship because the man was married, had children, and the author didn't know that he was cheating. The man asked the author not to out him, but the author is considering informing the wife about the affair to protect her, even if it out him in the process.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had a relationship with someone who was married without knowing his marital status. That's a problem because the man was cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage, so their initial actions aren't malicious. However, the fact that they continued the relationship after finding out he's married and cheating is more questionable. They might feel guilt because they've been cheated on themselves, which adds to their conflict.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating spouse. The man is in the closet, so the author is in a position where they have to weigh the wife's right to know about the infidelity against the husband's desire to stay closeted. The author is trying to decide if they should inform the wife, possibly outing him. \n\nThe author's intent here is to do the right thing by the wife, which is understandable. However, the act of informing the wife without the husband's consent could breach his confidentiality. If the author outed him, that would be a violation of a promise he made to keep his secrets. But the husband is the one who's cheating, which is also a betrayal. The author's dilemma is between two wrongs: letting the wife be unaware of the affair or outing the husband against his wishes.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The husband's actions are dishonest, and the wife is being cheated on. However, the author wasn't in a relationship with the wife; they were in an affair with the husband. The author's responsibility here is to respect the husband's privacy as he asked them not to out him. But since the husband is already cheating, there's a conflict between his wishes and the wife's rights.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife. But they did enter into the relationship unknowingly, so they might be partly responsible for the situation. However, the key is whether they have the right to disclose this information. The author should consider if there's a way to inform the wife without outing the husband's sexuality, perhaps focusing on the infidelity without revealing his sexual orientation. If possible, that would be a middle ground. If not, they might have to make a difficult choice, but they're not entirely in the wrong for trying to do the right thing for the wife. The main issue is the husband's actions, not the author's intent to expose the cheating. So, the author isn't in the wrong for considering this action, as they're trying to right a wrong done to the wife, even though it complicates the husband's situation.\n"
