I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They slept together multiple times, and the man was cheating on his wife. The author now wants to tell the wife about the cheating but is worried about outing him to his family, which might not accept his sexuality.\n\nThe key points here: the man is married, cheating, and the author is considering exposing this affair to the wife. But doing so would out him. The author is conflicted between not wanting to out him and the wife's right to know. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the author in the wrong? Well, the man was deceptive, lying about his marital status and being in a committed relationship. The author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. The author is now facing the consequences and wants to inform the wife, which is understandable. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a big deal, especially if it's against their wishes.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, who has been cheated on. The man's decision to be in a closeted relationship and cheat complicates things. The author didn't know the man was married, so they weren't intentionally cheating. They might feel guilt because of their own past experience with being cheated on.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose to tell the wife, even if it out him, are they doing something wrong? Or is protecting someone's privacy (his sexuality) more important than the wife's right to know about the infidelity?\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author is in a bind between two wrongs. They might not be in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, but they have to consider the consequences of outing him. However, the man is the one who was deceptive in the first place. The author is a third party who was misled. \n\nGiven that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to right a wrong done to the wife. The main issue is the man's actions, not the author's intention to expose the cheating. The author might be in the right to inform the wife, even if it comes at the cost of outing him, because the wife has a right to know. But the author should consider other ways to inform the wife without outing him if possible. If not, then it's a difficult decision, but the author's intention is to do the right thing.\n"
