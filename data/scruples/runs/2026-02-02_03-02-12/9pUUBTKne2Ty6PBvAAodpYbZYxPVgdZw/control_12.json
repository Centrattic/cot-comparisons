I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is a 20-year-old who had multiple sexual encounters with a man who is married and has kids. They met at a wedding, and the man was an usher. The man is gay but in the closet, and the author promised not to out him. Later, the author finds out the man is married and cheating, and now is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had consensual relationships with someone who is married and cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage initially. The man is in the closet, so outing him could have serious consequences. The author is considering exposing the cheating to the wife, which would mean outing him, possibly causing family issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had multiple affairs with a married man. Even if they didn't know he was married initially, after finding out, continuing the relationship could be seen as contributing to the cheating. But the author did confront him and felt bad about it. \n\nSecond, the dilemma is about whether to inform the wife. The author is torn between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's main wrong would be the affair itself. However, the man was already cheating, so the author was part of that. But since the author didn't know he was married at first, maybe that's a mitigating factor. Now, the author is considering exposing the cheating, which would mean outing him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for planning to tell the wife? Well, if the author is planning to expose the affair to the wife, that's a breach of confidentiality. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, outing the man's sexuality could have severe repercussions for him, especially if his family is not accepting. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. If the author tells the wife, they are doing the right thing by the wife but wrong by the man. If they don't tell, they might be enabling the cheating. But the author is also considering the man's privacy and family situation. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial mistake was having the affair. However, the author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, which could be seen as morally correct. But at what cost? The author might be outting him, which is a significant issue. \n\nBut the author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife. However, they are also considering the consequences for the man. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the act of outing him without considering all options could be problematic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, like through a letter or anonymously. The author could do that to protect his identity. \n\nSo, the author's dilemma is real. But the initial action (the affair) is wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the entire situation. \n\nThe author is in the wrong for the affair but is now trying to make amends. However, the main question is about the act of exposing the cheater, which would out him. If the author does that, they are wrong for outing him, but if they do it anonymously, maybe not. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but in a way that might out the man, it's a complex situation. The answer might depend on the perspective. \n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) context, the community often considers intent and consequences. The author is trying to help the wife but is causing harm to the man. However, the man was the one who cheated. \n\nSo, the author's main wrong is the affair, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the action of exposing. The answer is likely B (No), because the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it's a difficult choice. However, the author should consider anonymous ways to inform the wife to avoid outing the man. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, as it's an attempt to right a wrong, but should find a way to do it without outing him. So the answer is B.\n"
