I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The key points here are about the author's actions and the moral dilemma they're facing.\n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and in the closet. The person they slept with is in a committed marriage with children, and the author found out later about the marriage. The author is now considering exposing the cheater to his wife, which would also out him as gay, despite his desire to stay in the closet.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong by planning to inform the wife about the cheating. On one side, the author is trying to do the right thing by protecting the wife's rights to know about the infidelity. On the other side, outing someone without their consent is a serious breach of privacy, especially when they're in the closet. The author is caught between two conflicting moral obligations: the wife's right to know versus the man's right to privacy regarding his sexual orientation.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), then the reasoning would focus on the author violating the man's confidentiality and the potential harm of outing him, even if the intention is to help the wife. If the answer is B (No), it's because the author is trying to do the right thing by exposing a cheater, even if it means outing him, which could be seen as a necessary evil.\n\nBut there's another angle: the author is the one who had the affair without knowing the man was married. That's a problem because the author was also involved in a relationship that they knew could be problematic. The man was in a marriage and had a secret life, but the author's actions also contributed to the situation. So, the author might share some responsibility here.\n\nHowever, the central question is about the current dilemma. The author is considering exposing the cheater to the wife, which would out him. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for this potential action. If the author is justified in wanting to protect the wife from being cheated on, then they might not be in the wrong. But if outing someone without their consent is inherently wrong, regardless of the reason, then the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting someone's privacy and autonomy is a key principle. Outing someone can have severe consequences, even if the intent is to protect another party. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The conflict here is between two rights: the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own complicity. The author had a consensual affair with someone who was married without knowing. The author might be as much at fault as the man for the affair. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater now.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the act of informing the wife while outing the man is considered a violation of his privacy. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing him, that would be ideal. But if the only way to inform the wife is to out him, then the author has to weigh the harm. Since the man is in a closeted situation, outing him could lead to family issues and personal trauma, which the author is aware of. On the other hand, the wife is being cheated on, which is a significant harm.\n\nIn this context, many would argue that the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of intent. The dilemma is a tough one, but the author's intention is to prevent further harm to the wife. However, the method (outing) is ethically questionable. So, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method of doing so (outing) is problematic. However, the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong for the act of exposing the cheater by outing him. If the act of outing is considered wrong, then the answer is A. If the intent is to do the right thing despite the method, then B.\n\nGiven that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that outing someone is a serious breach of privacy, even with good intentions, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong for outing the man, even if the motive is to protect the wife. The right thing would be to find a way to inform the wife without outing him, but the act of doing it through outing is wrong.\n"
