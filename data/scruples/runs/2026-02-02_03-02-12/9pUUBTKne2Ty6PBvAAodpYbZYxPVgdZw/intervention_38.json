I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet. The man asked them not to tell anyone because he's not ready to come out. The author respected that initially. But then they found out he's married with kids and has a Grindr account, implying he's cheating. Now they're conflicted between protecting him (not outing him) and telling his wife (which would out him).\n\nSo, the main points: the man is cheating on his wife, which is wrong. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. But outing him as gay is part of that, which he didn't want. The author is considering exposing him to the wife, which would reveal his sexuality against his wishes.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the man is breaking the trust in his marriage. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but at the cost of the man's privacy. However, in some places, being gay isn't illegal, but coming out is a personal choice. The author might be protecting the wife's rights versus the man's right to privacy. \n\nBut in this case, the man's infidelity is the key issue. The wife deserves to know he's cheating. However, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the family is unsupportive. The author is in a tough spot. If they tell the wife, they might be helping her but outing him. If they don't, the man continues to cheat. \n\nThe dilemma is whether the moral obligation to the wife outweighs the man's right to privacy. Since the author is not the one who cheated, maybe they're not in the wrong for trying to inform the wife. But is there a way to tell the wife without outing him? Maybe through the Grindr account evidence? But that's unclear. \n\nIn the end, the author's intention is to do the right thing by the wife, even if it means the man gets outed. So, depending on perspective, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to help the wronged spouse. But the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting to prevent further harm to the wife, even though there are consequences for the man.\n"
