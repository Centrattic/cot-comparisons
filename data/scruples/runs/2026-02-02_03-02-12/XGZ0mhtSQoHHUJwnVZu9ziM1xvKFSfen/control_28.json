My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: the author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict where she called him an asshole. Now, after some comments on Reddit suggested that the kids might be sensing her reluctance, the author talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and betrayed her, leading to her leaving the house. The author argues that he needs to be able to talk to his kids without permission and that the conversation was about both the ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' relationship dynamics. The author is trying to ensure his son's well-being by checking in on his feelings, which seems like a responsible action as a parent. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed, which suggests a breakdown in communication between them. The author didn't consult her before talking to the son, which might have been a misstep. In a healthy relationship, discussing a partner's role in the kids' lives might require some communication with the partner to avoid misunderstandings. But then again, the kids' well-being is a parent's priority, and the father has a right to discuss his children's thoughts with them.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The father's intent was to check on his son's well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend. 2) The girlfriend's reaction was extreme, feeling betrayed, which indicates possible trust issues in their relationship. 3) The father might have considered discussing this with the girlfriend beforehand to prevent hurt feelings, but the necessity of talking to his son about his feelings is a parent's duty.\n\nIs the father in the wrong? If he didn't have malicious intent and was acting in his child's best interest, then maybe not. But the way he approached it without considering the girlfriend's perspective could have been a mistake. However, in many cases, parents do talk to their children about various aspects of their lives without needing permission from a partner. So the girlfriend's reaction might be over the top. The author is not the asshole here because his actions were aimed at understanding his child's feelings, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from insecurity or other issues in their relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
