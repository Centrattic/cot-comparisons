My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. His girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Then, he decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how the son feels regarding the new living situation and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intentions behind the conversation. The author states he wanted to check in on his son's feelings, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is that he lacks confidence in her. But the author argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without her permission.\n\nFrom a parental standpoint, it's important for a parent to maintain a good relationship with their children and ensure they're not being negatively affected by the new living situation. The author's intention was to assess his son's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. However, the way the information is presented might matter. If the conversation was framed in a way that made the girlfriend feel criticized, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the author claims the discussion was balanced, covering both his ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend. If that's true, then his intent wasn't to undermine her. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the author has a right to communicate with his children about their living environment, especially when there are potential conflicts or emotional impacts.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her relationship with the kids is her domain, but as a partner, the author is also a parent and has a role in those discussions. The conflict here might stem from communication styles and boundaries. The author didn't go to the girlfriend first, but there's no indication he should have. Parents often make decisions about their children's well-being without needing approval from their partner, especially in co-parenting or living arrangements with a partner.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem justified as part of his parental duty. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author isn't in the wrong for checking in on his son's feelings. The answer should be B (No).\n"
