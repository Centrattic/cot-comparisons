My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking it was undermining her, and had a big reaction. The user believes the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school and watch them, which led to an argument. Now, he's concerned about the kids' well-being and how they perceive their mom (the ex) being away and their new stepmom. He talks to his son, and the girlfriend finds out and is furious, leading her to leave the house for a while and question the relationship.\n\nThe key points here: the author's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings, possibly to ensure the kids are adjusting well to the new living situation. The girlfriend felt that discussing her with the son was an attack on her and a lack of confidence in her as a partner. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, as a parent, the author has a responsibility to understand how his children are feeling about their family dynamics, including their new caregiver (the girlfriend). It's reasonable and responsible for a parent to have these conversations to address any potential issues and support their children's emotional well-being. The author didn't ask the son to criticize the girlfriend; he was just exploring how the son felt about the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child in a private conversation, without including her, could be perceived as secretive or a setup for criticism. Even if the author's intentions were good, the way he approached it might not have considered the girlfriend's feelings. Children can be sensitive, and the father's conversation could have made the son feel like he's supposed to report or evaluate the girlfriend, which might not be the best approach without some prior discussion. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. The author is trying to address the kids' adjustment, which is a valid concern. The fact that the son was open and positive in the conversation should have been a relief, not a reason for the girlfriend to overreact. That said, communication between the author and his girlfriend is probably lacking here. If the author had discussed his concerns with her first, he might have gotten her perspective and maybe avoided the misunderstanding. \n\nThe AITA format usually looks at intentions and how actions affected others. The author's intention was to support his children, which is justified. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, is her own response. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by talking to the son without involving the girlfriend. But in many cases, parents do discuss family matters with their children without consulting a partner. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. His actions were in the best interest of his children's emotional health. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurities or misinterpretations. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's not a cultural or relational norm I'm missing. In some contexts, involving a partner in such discussions might be expected, but the father's role is to prioritize his children's needs. Therefore, B is the better choice.\n"
