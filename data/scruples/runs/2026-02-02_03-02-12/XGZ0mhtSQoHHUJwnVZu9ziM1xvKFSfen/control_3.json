My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and she recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Then, he sat down with his oldest son to talk about how he feels about the situation, including the new girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo the key points here are: the father talked to his son about his girlfriend, and the girlfriend reacted negatively. The father believes he's not in the wrong because he needed to talk to his kids without prior approval. The girlfriend feels her position is being undermined.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, talking to children about family dynamics is important. Kids can pick up on tensions, so checking in with them is responsible. The father didn't do anything harmful; he was ensuring the kids' well-being. However, the way he approached it might have been a factor. Did he mention the girlfriend in a negative context? The post says the conversation was about both his ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend, but the father's intention was not to undermine the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left the house and wants to break up. That's a strong response. But the father has a right to discuss his children's feelings with them, especially regarding their living situation and family dynamics. The girlfriend's insecurity might be the issue here. If she's in a relationship with the father, she should understand that he has a responsibility to his children. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a communication issue. The father didn't discuss this with his girlfriend first. Even though he had a right to talk to his son, perhaps discussing it with the girlfriend beforehand could have prevented misunderstandings. But the father's main responsibility is to his children's emotional health. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the girlfriend felt her role was being questioned, she might need to address her own insecurities. The father isn't wrong for prioritizing his children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own issues with the situation rather than the father's actions. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the father isn't in the wrong. He acted appropriately by checking in with his son to ensure he's adjusting well. The girlfriend's overreaction is more about her own feelings rather than the father's wrongdoing.\n"
