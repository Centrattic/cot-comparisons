My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, felt undermined, and accused him of not having confidence in her. The author thinks he's not wrong because he needed to talk to his kids about important stuff, like their mom being away and the girlfriend's role in their lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent with two kids, and he's living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She was already upset about that, which led to some conflict. Now, he sat down with his oldest son to discuss how the kids feel about the current situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend took offense and left.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author was trying to understand his son's feelings about the family situation, but he didn't check with his girlfriend first. The girlfriend felt that by talking to the son about her, he was undermining her authority or not trusting her. The author argues that as a parent, he needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nIs the author wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend? Well, parents do need to communicate with their children about various aspects of their lives, especially when there are changes like a parent being away or a new partner involved. It's important for the child's well-being to know how they feel about these situations. The author wasn't criticizing the girlfriend; he was just getting the son's perspective. However, the way he approached it might have been a problem. If he didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings or didn't frame the conversation in a way that doesn't make her feel attacked, that could lead to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left the house and rethought the relationship over a conversation that was meant to be about the children's well-being. It's possible that she felt insecure about her role in the family and the conversation triggered those insecurities. But the author is right that as a parent, he should have the autonomy to discuss his children's feelings without needing permission from his partner. \n\nHowever, there's a middle ground here. The author could have involved the girlfriend in the conversation, explaining that he wanted to talk to the kids about the family dynamics, including her role, to ensure the kids' adjustment. That way, both the girlfriend's feelings and the children's well-being could be addressed. Not discussing the issue with the girlfriend beforehand might have been a misstep, even if the intention was good.\n\nIn terms of the son's age, 8 and 14. The author talked to the oldest, 14-year-old. That's appropriate to have more in-depth conversations. The 8-year-old might not be as able to articulate his feelings yet. The author's action was to check in on how the kids are feeling, which is a responsible parent's duty.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems overly dramatic. But it's possible she felt threatened or insecure. However, the author's intent was to support his children, not to undermine his girlfriend. The problem might be in the approach rather than the action itself. The author isn't wrong for wanting to talk to his kids, but maybe he could have handled it differently to avoid making the girlfriend feel undermined.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's primary mistake was not discussing this conversation with his girlfriend first, even though his intentions were good. But the girlfriend's reaction is also excessive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he had a legitimate reason to talk to his son and it's a parent's right to discuss family matters with their children, he's not entirely in the wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction doesn't make him the asshole. Therefore, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
