My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend. The situation involves a father talking to his oldest son (14 years old) about the living arrangement and his feelings towards the girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's perspective. As a parent, he has a responsibility to his children's well-being. Talking to his son about the family situation, especially after previous feedback about the kids sensing tension, seems like a reasonable step. The father was concerned about his son's feelings and wanted to ensure he wasn't being negatively affected.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She felt betrayed and undermined. However, the father didn't discuss her in a negative light; it was a conversation about the child's feelings towards both his mother's absence and the girlfriend. The father argues that it's necessary to talk to his kids without needing permission from his partner, which is a valid point. Parents should be able to communicate with their children about family dynamics without interference from a new partner, especially when the children's emotional health is at stake.\n\nThe key points here are the father's intent and the necessity of the conversation. His intention was to check in on his son's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling slighted rather than the son being harmed. The father's actions align with his duty as a parent, and the girlfriend's insecurity might be valid, but that doesn't make the father wrong for having the conversation. \n\nSo, considering the father's responsibilities as a parent and the context of the conversation, the answer is likely B (No). The father isn't in the wrong because he's fulfilling his role as a parent by engaging with his child about family matters.\n"
