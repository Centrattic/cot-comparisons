My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and the older son (14) was having a conversation about the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he was undermining her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. As a parent, talking to your child about their feelings and important life changes is a normal part of parenting. The author mentioned that he had the conversation because others suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of interest in being there. He wanted to check in with his son, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt betrayed and that her authority was undermined. The key point here is whether the author should have discussed this with the girlfriend first. While parents do have the right to talk to their children without prior approval, the manner in which the conversation was conducted might matter. The question is whether the parent's actions were respectful of the girlfriend's position or not.\n\nThe author argues that the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend, and that he didn't intend to undermine her. But the girlfriend took it as a personal attack. The line between a parent's duty to their child and respecting a partner's feelings can be blurry. In a co-parenting situation, especially with a step-parent or partner, communication is key. However, the parent's primary role is to their children, and discussing a child's feelings doesn't inherently undermine a partner unless it's done in a way that's critical or dismissive.\n\nThe author didn't go into the conversation with the intent to criticize the girlfriend, just to understand his son's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not respected in her role. But the parent isn't in the wrong for fulfilling their duty to their child. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's reaction than the parent's action. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
