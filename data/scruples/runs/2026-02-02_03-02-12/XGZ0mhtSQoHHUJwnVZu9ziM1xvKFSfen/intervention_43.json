My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to some conflict. Then, after hearing comments that the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance, he talks to his oldest son about how he feels regarding the mother (who's away) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author's defense is that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend, and the conversation was about both the mother and the girlfriend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are parental rights versus the girlfriend's feelings. The author's action is to check in with his son about his well-being and perceptions, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is that she feels undermined, but the author didn't go to the son to criticize her. The conversation was part of understanding how the child feels. \n\nThe author's argument is that he needs to communicate with his children freely, especially regarding their well-being, without needing his girlfriend's approval. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on feeling that her role is being questioned. But is the author in the wrong? Well, parents should be able to talk to their kids about family dynamics. Unless he's badmouthing the girlfriend, which he didn't mention, just discussing perceptions. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the author's intention was to check on his son's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his role as a parent. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations about her role in the household. So answer B.\n"
