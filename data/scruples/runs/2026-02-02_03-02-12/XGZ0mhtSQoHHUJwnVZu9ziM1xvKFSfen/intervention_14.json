My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and two sons) had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined. The author is wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend is appropriate. The author's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being after previous feedback about the girlfriend's behavior. He wanted to make sure the kids weren't being negatively affected. \n\nFrom a parental standpoint, it's reasonable for a parent to communicate with their children about family dynamics, especially when they have concerns. The conversation wasn't malicious; it was about both the ex-wife and the girlfriend. The author didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend but to ensure the children are okay. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined. That's a valid emotional response. The problem might be in how the conversation was approached. Did the father discuss the girlfriend without her input? Maybe there's a lack of communication between the two adults about how to handle such situations. \n\nBut from the father's perspective, he's responsible for his children's well-being and needs to be able to talk to them without needing permission from his partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father is wrong. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, when co-parenting or living with a partner, there's a balance between protecting the child's best interests and respecting the partner's feelings. The father acted in the child's interest, which is his primary responsibility. The girlfriend might have felt that her relationship with the child was her domain, but the father has a right to be involved in his children's lives. \n\nSo, the author's actions were in the best interest of his child. The girlfriend's reaction is a communication issue, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
