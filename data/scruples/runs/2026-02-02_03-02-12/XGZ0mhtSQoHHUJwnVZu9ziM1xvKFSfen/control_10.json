My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author talking to his 14-year-old son about the son's feelings towards the author's girlfriend and the son's mother. The girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had previously posted about asking his girlfriend to watch the kids, which caused conflict. Now, he's addressing the son's well-being by having a conversation. The key points here are: the author had a legitimate reason to check in on his son's feelings, especially after people on Reddit suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of engagement. The author didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend but to ensure the kids' emotional health. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she felt betrayed and left the house. But the author argues that as a parent, he needs to be able to talk to his children without needing permission. The question is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, talking to children about their family dynamics is generally seen as a responsible action. However, if the conversation was framed in a way that criticized the girlfriend in front of the child, that could be problematic. But the author mentions the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend, implying it was balanced. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling disrespected. However, the author's intent was to check in with his son, not to undermine the girlfriend. Since parents have a right to discuss their children's emotional state with them, and given the prior concerns about the girlfriend's role, the author's action is justified. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's doing his duty as a parent, and the girlfriend's reaction seems more about her own insecurities than the conversation itself. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
