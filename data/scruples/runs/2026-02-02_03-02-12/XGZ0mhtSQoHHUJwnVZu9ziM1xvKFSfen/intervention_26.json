My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nThe author is a dad who talks to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and thinks he undermined her. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to check in on his kids' well-being, especially since the girlfriend was handling school pickups. He was advised in a previous post that kids might sense the girlfriend's resistance, so he wanted to confirm with his son. That seems reasonable as a parent wanting to ensure their children are happy and not being affected by family dynamics.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014she called him an asshole and left. But the author isn't in the wrong if he's fulfilling his parental duty. Parents should be able to talk to their kids about family members without needing permission. The author didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend; he was focused on the kids' well-being. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a communication issue. The author might not have considered how the conversation could be perceived by the girlfriend, but that's more about how the message was delivered rather than the act itself. The core issue is whether the conversation itself is wrong. \n\nSince the author's main goal was the child's welfare and not to criticize the girlfriend, he's likely not in the wrong. The girlfriend's insecurity might be causing her to overreact. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
