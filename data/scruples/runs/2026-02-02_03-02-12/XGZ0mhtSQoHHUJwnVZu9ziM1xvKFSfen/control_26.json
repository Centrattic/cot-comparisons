My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to some conflict. Then, the author sat down with his oldest son to talk about how he feels about the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and accused the author of lacking confidence in her. The author is now asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's coping with his mom being away and his feelings towards the girlfriend. The author didn't consult the girlfriend before this conversation, which led to her feeling betrayed. \n\nNow, from a general perspective, parents have a responsibility to talk to their children about family dynamics. The author's action seems to come from a place of concern for his son's well-being, especially since there were comments in the previous post about the kids sensing tension. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in this way without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or presence in the home. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, parents should be able to discuss family matters with their children. It's important for the child's emotional health. However, the way the conversation was handled might be a factor. If the author was critical of the girlfriend or made the son feel there's a problem, that could be an issue. But according to the post, the conversation was balanced, covering both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. The son was happy with the situation, so the author's intent seems to be checking in, not undermining.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left the house and called him a 6-year-old, which might indicate her own insecurities or issues with the situation. The author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his child is okay. However, maybe he should have discussed the intention to talk to the son with the girlfriend first, especially if there's a co-parenting dynamic. But given that the girlfriend is living with them and involved in the kids' daily lives, the author's responsibility to communicate with his child directly is valid. \n\nIn many cases, the parent's need to discuss things with their child isn't wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own feelings of being criticized rather than the act of talking to the child. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
