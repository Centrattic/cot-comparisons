My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nSo the situation: The author is a parent with two sons, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to some conflict. Then, the author sat down with his oldest son to discuss how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, and left the house to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's a parent who needs to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend first. He didn't mean to undermine her, and the conversation was also about the mother being away. The girlfriend is reacting strongly, feeling her confidence is hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. Parents often talk to their children about various topics, including family dynamics. The key points here might be consent and the context of the conversation. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before talking to the son, but is that necessary? \n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to understand how the kids feel about the people in their lives. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her could affect the child's perception or loyalty, but the parent's duty is to the child. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014calling it a betrayal and comparing the author to a six-year-old. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not have considered how the girlfriend would perceive the conversation, especially if it's a sensitive topic. But is it wrong to talk to your own child about someone who's part of the family? The author didn't go to undermine the girlfriend, but the girlfriend might feel her position is being questioned.\n\nThere's a balance between a parent's responsibility to their child and respecting the partner's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong because he's doing his duty as a parent, but maybe there's a way to approach it more sensitively. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is right.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action is not inherently wrong because he's talking to his child, which is a parent's role. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurity or feeling threatened, not the author's wrongdoing. So the answer is B.\n"
