My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old, and lives with his girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, the author talked to his oldest son (14) about his thoughts on the situation, including the girlfriend, and the girlfriend reacted very negatively, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He's a parent concerned about his children's well-being. He had a conversation with his son to understand how the kids are feeling about the living arrangement and their mother being away. He didn't intend to undermine his girlfriend; the conversation was also about the kids' mother, not just the girlfriend. He's an adult and believes he should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels betrayed. She perceives the conversation as the author not trusting her and undermining her authority. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. She might feel that discussing her with the child in this context is a breach of trust, especially if it's done without her knowledge.\n\nNow, legal or ethical considerations: Parents have a right to discuss their children's well-being and family dynamics with their kids. It's part of parenting. However, how the conversation is framed matters. If the author was critical of his girlfriend in front of the child, that could be problematic. But the author states that the conversation was about the child's feelings and included both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. The son was happy with the situation, so maybe the author's intent was to ensure the kids are okay.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if the conversation was neutral. But if she felt that the conversation was done to criticize her or make the child doubt her, that's a different issue. The problem might be communication between the author and his girlfriend. Did he consider discussing it with her first? Maybe not, which could have led to her feeling blindsided. However, parents don't need their partner's permission to talk to their own children unless there's a court order or specific custody arrangement, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe key points are the intent and the context. The author's intent was to check in with his son, not to undermine his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling untrusted or criticized. But the author isn't wrong for discussing his kids' feelings. Parents should be able to have such conversations. It's possible there's a communication breakdown between the author and his girlfriend, but the act of talking to the child isn't inherently wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for having the conversation. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, doesn't make the author the asshole here. He's acting as a parent concerned about his children's well-being. The real issue might be how they communicate with each other as a couple. So the answer is B.\n"
