My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a father with two sons, 8 and 14. He lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Now, after considering feedback from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son about how the son feels about the situation, including his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are: The author's intent was to check in with his son's well-being, considering previous comments about the kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. He wanted to ensure his children weren't negatively affected. But the girlfriend interprets this as a lack of trust and confidence in her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, parents do need to talk to their children about family dynamics, especially when there are changes like a new caregiver. However, the way he approached it might have been an issue. He didn't clear it with his girlfriend first, which could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. But on the other hand, he's a parent with a responsibility to his kids' emotional health. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings of being undermined are valid if he didn't communicate with her beforehand. However, the father's actions were for his children's sake. It's a balance between respecting the partner's feelings and fulfilling parental duties. Since the father had a legitimate concern about his children's well-being, and the conversation was not maliciously intended to undermine, he might not be in the wrong. But there's room for better communication between him and his girlfriend to avoid such conflicts.\n"
