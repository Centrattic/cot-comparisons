My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and left, thinking he undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man has two kids and a girlfriend. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to help with the kids a few days a week. She called him an asshole. Then he talked to his son about her and the situation, which the girlfriend found out and reacted strongly. She feels betrayed and thinks he lacks confidence in her. He argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing her permission.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Parents usually have the right to talk to their children about family matters. The son is 8 and 14 years old, but the conversation in question might be about the older one. The father wants to ensure his kids are okay with the living situation and the girlfriend. But maybe the way he approached the conversation was the issue. Did he mention the girlfriend negatively? The user says the conversation was as much about the ex-wife's absence as about the girlfriend. But the girlfriend took it as undermining.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the son without her knowledge breaches trust. In relationships, communication is key. If the father didn't consult her first, maybe that's a problem. But he's a parent; he needs to prioritize his kids' well-being. However, the girlfriend might see it as a personal attack. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The father's intention was to check on his son's feelings, which is reasonable. However, not discussing this with his girlfriend first might have been a misstep. But is it his fault? If the kids need to express their feelings, the father should be able to talk to them. But maybe the way he framed the conversation was the problem. If he was critical of the girlfriend, that's different. The user says he didn't mean to undermine her. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid if she felt disrespected. The father might not be wrong, but he could have handled it better by including her in the conversation. However, the core issue is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend is inherently wrong. \n\nIn many cases, discussing relationship dynamics with children is part of parenting. The father isn't in the wrong for wanting to know his son's perspective. The girlfriend's overreaction might be her issue, but the father should consider how to approach such topics sensitively. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but with the nuance that communication between the couple could improve. The father's actions are justified as part of his parental responsibility, even if the girlfriend took it the wrong way.\n"
