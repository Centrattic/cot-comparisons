My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids and watch them a few days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Now, after considering advice from Reddit comments, he talked to his oldest son about how the son feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left to stay with a friend, saying she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong here. The author's argument is that he needed to talk to his kids to ensure they're not being affected negatively by his girlfriend's possible lack of engagement. He also mentions that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mother being away. He feels he's not wrong because parents need to talk to their kids without needing permission from their partner.\n\nTo evaluate: Parents have a responsibility to their children's well-being. Discussing their feelings and perceptions is part of that. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she sees the conversation as a criticism of her, especially if it's about her role as a caretaker. However, the author's intent was to check in with his son, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. The key is whether the action itself was wrong. Since the author had a legitimate reason to talk to his son and it's part of parenting, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The girlfriend might have a right to her feelings, but the action itself is justified.\n"
