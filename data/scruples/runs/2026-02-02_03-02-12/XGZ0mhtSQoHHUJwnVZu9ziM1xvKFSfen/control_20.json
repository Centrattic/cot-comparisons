My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a father of two boys who lives with his girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Then, after reading Reddit comments suggesting that the kids might be picking up on the tension, he decided to talk to his oldest son about how he feels regarding the situation, including his mother (the ex, I assume) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out about this and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo the question is whether talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend is wrong. Let's break it down. The father's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, which is a valid concern as a parent. He mentions that the conversation was also about his son's mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, feels that this conversation was undermining her and that he has no confidence in her. He argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's actions. Parents often have conversations with their children to ensure they're adjusting well to family dynamics. The fact that he didn't consult the girlfriend first might be a point, but is it necessary? If the kids are his children, he has a right to discuss their feelings. However, the girlfriend might feel that her role in the household is being questioned. But the father's perspective is that it's about the children's well-being, not about the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling him a 6-year-old and needing to rethink the relationship. Maybe she's overreacting, but perhaps there's an underlying issue of trust. The father might not have considered how the conversation could affect his girlfriend's feelings. While the intention was good, maybe he should have discussed the conversation with her first, especially since she's part of the children's lives now.\n\nBut on the other hand, the father's responsibility is to his children. If he's concerned about their emotional state, talking to them is necessary. The girlfriend might feel insecure or threatened by the conversation, but that's her emotional response. The key is whether the father overstepped. Since he's the parent, he has the right to talk to his kids about family matters. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about her own insecurities rather than the father doing something wrong.\n\nSo, the father's actions are justified. The problem might be in the way he approached it, but the act of talking to his son about family dynamics isn't wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction is more about her handling the situation poorly. Therefore, the father isn't the asshole here.\n"
