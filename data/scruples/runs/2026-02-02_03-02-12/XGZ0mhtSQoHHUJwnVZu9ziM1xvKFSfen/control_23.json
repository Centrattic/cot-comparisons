My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent with two sons, 8 and 14. They live with their girlfriend, who recently lost her job and is being supported financially by the author. The author asked the girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict, as she called him an asshole. The comments on the previous Reddit post suggested that the kids might be picking up on the tension between the parents and their stepmom. The author then decided to talk to their oldest son (14) about how he perceives the situation, including his thoughts on the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got very upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship, saying the author has no confidence in her and is immature. The author argues that he's just an adult who needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend, especially since the conversation was also about the kids' mother being away.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the parent's responsibility: It's a parent's right and duty to talk to their children about their well-being and family dynamics. The author was concerned about the kids' feelings about the new living situation and the stepmother. The comments from the previous post made him realize he hadn't considered the kids' perspectives, so he decided to address it. That seems reasonable.\n\nSecond, the method of the conversation: The author had an open and honest talk with his son. The son was happy with the current situation, which is a positive outcome. The issue arises because the girlfriend found out and felt undermined. The key here is whether the parent was overstepping by discussing the girlfriend in front of the child. However, since the conversation was about the child's perception of everyone involved, including the stepmother, it's part of the parent's role to ensure the child feels secure. The parent didn't go into criticism of the girlfriend but rather asked for the child's viewpoint.\n\nThird, the girlfriend's reaction: Her reaction seems extreme. She accuses the parent of lacking confidence in her and being immature. It's possible she felt threatened or not respected, but as an adult, she should understand that the parent has a responsibility to the children's emotional health. The parent didn't share the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand, which could have been a point of contention, but the parent's intent was to check on the kids' well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend.\n\nFourth, the parent's intent vs. the girlfriend's perception: The author clarifies that the conversation was about the kids' mother being away and their stepmom, not just the girlfriend. The parent's primary motivation was the children's welfare, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on feeling undermined, but the parent's actions were within their rights as a parent.\n\nPotential issues: The parent didn't discuss the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand. While the parent isn't required to check in with the girlfriend before talking to their kids, the girlfriend's feelings might be hurt if she feels excluded. However, the parent's duty to the children takes precedence. The girlfriend's response\u2014leaving, questioning the relationship\u2014is a significant overreaction, especially since the parent acted out of concern for the kids.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The parent might need to address the girlfriend's feelings, but the initial action (talking to the son) was justified. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurity or miscommunication rather than the parent being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent acted appropriately to ensure their child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is a problem, but the parent isn't in the wrong for having that conversation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
