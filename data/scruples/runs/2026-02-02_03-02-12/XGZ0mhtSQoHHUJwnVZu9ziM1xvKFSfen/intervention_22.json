My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The father has two kids, lives with his girlfriend who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids sometimes, which led to a conflict. The father then talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the new living situation and his stepmother (the girlfriend). The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined. \n\nThe key points here are the father's intention and the way he handled the conversation. The father's goal was to check in with his son about his adjustment, which is a responsible thing for a parent to do. The son was happy, so the conversation seems well-intentioned. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt her authority was questioned. The problem might be that the father didn't consider how discussing the girlfriend in front of the son could affect their relationship. Even though the father's intent was to understand his son's feelings, the girlfriend might perceive it as the father doubting her capability or not trusting her. \n\nIn co-parenting or stepfamily situations, communication is crucial. The father might have assumed that talking to his child was necessary without realizing it could hurt the girlfriend. On the other hand, a parent should have the right to discuss their children's emotions and adjustments. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is also extreme\u2014leaving the house and saying she needs to rethink the relationship over a conversation with the child. That seems like overreacting, but maybe she felt insecure or not trusted. \n\nThe father is right in wanting to ensure his son is okay, but maybe the approach could have been discussed with the girlfriend first, to avoid misunderstandings. However, it's not clear if the father should have to clear every conversation with his child through his partner. \n\nSo, considering all angles: The father's action was necessary for the child's well-being, but the execution might have been a miscommunication. The answer leans towards the father not being in the wrong because he was acting in his child's best interest, even if the girlfriend took it personally.\n"
