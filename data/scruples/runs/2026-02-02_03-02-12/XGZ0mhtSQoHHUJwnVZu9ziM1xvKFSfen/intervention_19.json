My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and his two sons. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he's been supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole in a previous situation. Now, in this current situation, he's had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend and his mother, who's not around. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leaving the house to stay with a friend.\n\nThe author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, considering the previous comments about his kids picking up on negative behavior. He wanted to ensure his children felt okay with the current living situation. The girlfriend, however, sees this as the author lacking confidence in her and feels it's a betrayal.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, as a parent, he has a responsibility to communicate with his children about their family dynamics. It's important for the kids to express their feelings about both their mother's absence and the girlfriend's presence. The author's action was proactive in addressing any potential issues the child might have, which is a responsible parenting move.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's perception negatively. However, the author mentions that the conversation was balanced, talking about both the mother and the girlfriend. The key point is whether the author overstepped by not discussing the conversation with the girlfriend first. But realistically, a parent shouldn't need permission from a partner to talk to their own children about family matters. The children are his primary responsibility, and ensuring their emotional well-being is crucial. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, given that the conversation was appropriate and aimed at the child's welfare.\n\nThe author is right to prioritize his children's needs. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or fear that the child's opinion could influence the relationship negatively. However, the author's actions don't constitute betrayal or undermining if done respectfully and with the child's best interest in mind. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
