My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a father of two, talked to his oldest son about how the son perceives his stepmom (girlfriend). The girlfriend got upset, felt undermined, and left the house. The author is wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a previous issue where his girlfriend was upset about him asking her to take care of the kids. People in the comments mentioned the kids might sense her not wanting to be there. So the author wanted to check in with his son to see how he felt. He didn't talk to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the child's perspective. \n\nFrom a parent's standpoint, it's important to ensure the children are comfortable and not being negatively affected. The author had valid reasons to talk to his son. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed because he discussed her with the child without consulting her first. That's a valid concern too, as step-parents might want to maintain a good relationship with the kids, and being the subject of a conversation could make them feel undervalued.\n\nBut the author is an adult, and so is the girlfriend. The father has a responsibility to his children's well-being. The conversation was about the child's feelings and the transition of his mom being away and the stepmom. The father isn't doing it to criticize but to assess the child's adjustment. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If she felt her role was being questioned, maybe she should have discussed her feelings with the father earlier. However, the father didn't have a malicious intent. The key points are the father's intent and the necessity of the conversation for the child's well-being. \n\nIn such cases, communication between the parents is crucial. The father should have considered discussing the conversation with the stepmom after talking to the child, especially if the child had concerns. But the act of talking to the child about the stepmom isn't inherently wrong, especially if the child is old enough (14) to have an opinion. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not trusted, but that doesn't make the father wrong for wanting to check on his child's adjustment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the father's actions were in the best interest of his child. The girlfriend's reaction is a communication issue between them, but the father isn't wrong for seeking his child's perspective. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
