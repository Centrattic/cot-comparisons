My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a dad living with his girlfriend and their two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of times a week. She got really upset and called him an asshole. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son about how he feels about the author's girlfriend and the situation with his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and is furious, thinking he undermined her. She left the house to stay with a friend and said she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole here. The key points here are his intent and the girlfriend's reaction. The author's main reason for talking to his son was to check in on how the kids are feeling, especially after some Reddit comments suggested the kids might be picking up on negative vibes from the girlfriend. He mentions he wanted to avoid hurting the kids and that the conversation was about both the ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend. \n\nNow, the girlfriend felt undermined, which is a big deal. The author's action was to talk to his child about the girlfriend, which might be seen as discussing her in a way that questions her role or ability. But the author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without the girlfriend's permission, as their well-being is important. \n\nI think the key here is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend is appropriate. Parents often talk to their kids about various people in their lives, including partners, to assess the child's feelings. However, if the conversation was critical or made the child feel there's something wrong with the girlfriend, that could be problematic. But the author says the son was happy with the arrangement. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if the conversation wasn't negative. But maybe she felt insecure or that the author didn't trust her. The author did mention that the conversation was part of a broader check on the kids' feelings about the living situation, not just about the girlfriend. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he had a legitimate concern about his children's well-being and sought their input. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but that doesn't automatically make the author the asshole. However, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings, but given the context of his kids' emotional state, it's a reasonable action. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
