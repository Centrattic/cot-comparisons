My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a father living with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Now, the author decided to talk to his oldest son about how the son feels about the current living situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, and left to stay with a friend.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son about his girlfriend. The author's reasoning is that he's a parent and needs to be able to talk to his kids about their lives without needing permission from his girlfriend. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that this conversation was a betrayal and a lack of confidence in her ability to parent or be part of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents have a duty to check in with their children's well-being, especially when there are significant changes in family dynamics, like the mother moving out and a new partner being involved. The author seems to be doing this as a responsible parent, wanting to ensure his son is adjusting well. The conversation was also about the mother being away, not just the girlfriend, which might have been a point the author wanted to clarify.\n\nHowever, the way the conversation was handled could be a factor. Did the parent approach the conversation in a way that was fair and respectful to both the son and the girlfriend? The author mentions that the conversation was \"just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her,\" suggesting he tried to balance the topics. But the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt targeted, which might mean that the framing of the conversation came across differently.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's perspective. If she felt that the conversation was an attack on her role as a caregiver or part of the family, that's a valid emotional response. Parents and partners need to communicate openly. Maybe the author didn't consider how the girlfriend would perceive the conversation before having it. Even though the parent has the right to talk to their children, the manner and context might have been handled better.\n\nBut wait, the parent's intent was not to undermine the girlfriend. The key here is intent versus perception. The author believed he was acting in the best interest of his child, but the girlfriend perceived it as undermining her. This is a common issue in relationships where different perspectives lead to conflict. However, the parent's responsibility to the child's emotional state and adjustment is crucial. The author was trying to address potential issues the son might have, which is a valid parental action.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be exaggerated, especially since the author is the parent and has the right to discuss family matters with their children. However, the parent could have communicated with the girlfriend about the intention to talk to the kids, to avoid misunderstandings. But the author argues that they are adults and that he shouldn't need permission. That's a valid point because parents should have autonomy in parenting decisions, especially when it involves their children's well-being.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might be seen as necessary for the child's welfare, the execution could have been smoother. However, the core issue is whether talking to his son was wrong. Since the parent's role includes monitoring the child's feelings and adjusting as needed, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction is more about her own insecurities or miscommunication rather than the father's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
