My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because she feels he undermined her by discussing her in a conversation with the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent-child relationship. Parents have a responsibility to understand how their children feel about their living situation and relationships. The author did have a conversation with his son to gauge his well-being, which is a normal and important part of parenting. The fact that he included the girlfriend's role might be where the conflict arises.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is also significant. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. The key point here is whether discussing the girlfriend with the child undermines her authority or position. However, since the son is 14, it's reasonable for the parent to talk to him about his feelings regarding both his mother being away and the stepmom. The author mentions the conversation wasn't to undermine but to check in on the child's perspective.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel insecure or perceive a lack of support, but the parent's duty is to the child's well-being. The author didn't do anything that would directly harm the child or the relationship with the girlfriend, unless there was a prior agreement not to discuss. Since the post doesn't mention any such agreement, the parent acted in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, the author's actions seem justified. The girlfriend's overreaction doesn't make the parent wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
