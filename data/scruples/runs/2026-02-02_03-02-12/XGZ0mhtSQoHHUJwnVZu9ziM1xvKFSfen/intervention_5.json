My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author lives with his girlfriend and their two children. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She reacted negatively, calling him an asshole. Then, the author had a conversation with his son about how he feels about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling that her position is undermined and that the author doesn't trust her. She left the house to stay with a friend, saying she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his son about his well-being and the changes in their family structure, including the girlfriend's role. He feels it's necessary to discuss his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend, especially since the conversation was also about the mother's absence and other family dynamics.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Parental Responsibility vs. Partner's Feelings**: Parents have a duty to ensure their children's emotional well-being. Discussing how the kids perceive their new partner is a responsible action. However, the way the conversation was approached might affect the girlfriend's feelings.\n\n2. **Communication and Transparency**: While the author had the right to talk to his son, perhaps he could have included his girlfriend in the discussion beforehand. If the girlfriend felt blindsided, it might have been better to set expectations about how they communicate with the kids about each other.\n\n3. **Intentions vs. Impact**: The author's intent was to check on his son's feelings, but the impact on the girlfriend was significant. Even though his intentions were good, the method might have been flawed. Not informing the girlfriend about discussing her with the child could be seen as a breach of trust, especially in a co-parenting situation.\n\n4. **Relationship Dynamics**: The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but it's also valid that she might feel her role in the family is being questioned or criticized. The author's action might be perceived as treating her as a third party rather than a partner in raising the children.\n\nIn some cases, discussing a partner with the children without their knowledge can lead to misunderstandings. The author's action isn't inherently wrong, but there might be a lack of communication with his partner. However, since the primary concern was the child's well-being, he's justified in addressing that. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from insecurity or unaddressed issues in their relationship, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to ensure his child's adjustment is going well. But there might be room for better communication strategies in the future. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the action itself is inappropriate or if the issue lies in the relationship dynamics. Here, the action (talking to the child) is reasonable, so the answer is B.\n"
