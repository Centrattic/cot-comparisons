My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author had a conversation with his oldest son to understand how the child feels about the living situation, including the girlfriend. The son was happy, so the author felt relieved. However, the girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined. She left the house and questioned the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission from the girlfriend, as they are adults. He didn't intend to undermine her; the conversation was also about the mother being away. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's reasonable for a parent to check in with their children about their well-being and relationships. The author's intention wasn't to attack the girlfriend but to ensure his son is okay. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. The key point is that the father has a responsibility to his children's emotional health. Discussing how the child feels about the people in their life, including the girlfriend, is part of that responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or mistrust, but the father isn't wrong for prioritizing his child's well-being. \n\nHowever, maybe the father could have approached it differently. Perhaps he should have discussed it with the girlfriend first to avoid conflict, but the situation doesn't specify any prior agreement about discussing the kids' feelings. Since the kids are his responsibility, the conversation was justified. The girlfriend's overreaction makes her the problematic party here, not the author. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
