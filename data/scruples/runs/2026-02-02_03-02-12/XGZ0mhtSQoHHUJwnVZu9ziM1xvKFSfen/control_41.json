My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has two kids and a girlfriend who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, but she called him an asshole. Then he had a conversation with his oldest son to check how the kids are feeling about the situation, including their mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, thinking he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. She left to stay with a friend and called the author a child.\n\nNow, the key points here: Parents have a right to talk to their children about family dynamics, especially when it involves their well-being. The author was concerned about how the kids were adjusting after their mom left and the new living situation. It seems like a reasonable action to check in with his son. However, the girlfriend felt her authority or position was being challenged by talking to the child about her. \n\nIs the author wrong to talk to his son? Well, parents should be able to discuss family matters with their kids without needing permission. The conversation was about the child's feelings and adjustments, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the author didn't intend to undermine her. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity rather than the father's action. However, maybe the father should have considered how the girlfriend might feel. But given that he's a parent and the kids' well-being is a priority, he's not wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because it's his role as a parent to check in with his children. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own feelings rather than the father's wrongdoing.\n"
