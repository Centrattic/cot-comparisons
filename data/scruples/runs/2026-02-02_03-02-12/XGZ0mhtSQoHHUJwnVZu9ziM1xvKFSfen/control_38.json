My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (a father of two) has a girlfriend who's living with him and his kids. The daughter was out of the picture, and the son is with the author. He asked the girlfriend to pick up the kids a few days a week, which she took as being called an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son (14-year-old) about how the son feels about the girlfriend and the mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, accusing him of undermining her and lacking confidence in her. She left to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole. The key points here are about the father's right to talk to his son about his family dynamics, including the girlfriend. The father did this out of concern for his son's well-being, as some previous comments on hisReddit post mentioned that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness. He wanted to check in with his son, and the son was okay with the current situation. \n\nNow, the girlfriend feels betrayed and undermined. The question is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend is inappropriate. From a parenting perspective, parents should be able to discuss family matters with their children to ensure they're adjusting well. The father didn't ask the son to criticize the girlfriend, just to express his feelings. It's part of normal parenting to check in on how children feel about new family members. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that the conversation was private or that the father didn't consider her feelings. But the father's intent was to support his son, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top, as discussing the children's feelings with them is a standard practice. \n\nSo, considering that the father's action was in the best interest of his child and that the girlfriend's perception of being undermined might stem from insecurity rather than the father's intent, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
