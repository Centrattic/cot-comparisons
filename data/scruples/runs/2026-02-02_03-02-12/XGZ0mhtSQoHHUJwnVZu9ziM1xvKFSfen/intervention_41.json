My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and felt undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author has two kids, 8 and 14. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. The author then talked to the oldest son about his feelings regarding his mother being away, living with them, and his opinion of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling betrayed. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to talk to their son without clearing it with the girlfriend first.\n\nSo, the main question is about the appropriateness of the father talking to his son about the girlfriend. The author argues that they needed to check in on the kids' well-being, which is a parent's duty. However, the girlfriend felt that this conversation was undermining her and that the author didn't trust her.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. As a parent, it's natural to want to understand how your children are feeling, especially when there are significant changes in their lives like a parent being away and a new partner involved. However, involving the new partner in the conversation isn't necessary; the focus is on the children's feelings. The author didn't share the conversation with the girlfriend but instead talked directly to the son. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be based on feeling that the father is not supporting her or is critical of her. If the father had approached the conversation with the intention of evaluating the girlfriend's role in the kids' lives, that could be problematic. However, the author's intention was to check in on the kids' emotional state, which is a valid reason. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the conversation was conducted. The author didn't mention discussing the girlfriend in a negative light. The son's thoughts were valid and positive, according to the author. However, the girlfriend's perception is that the father is undermining her, which might be due to her own insecurities or the existing tension from her job loss and the arrangement to pick up the kids.\n\nNow, whether the father is in the wrong. Parents have a right to talk to their children about their feelings and the people in their lives. However, there's a balance. If the father had shared concerns about the girlfriend's ability to care for the kids, that would be different. But here, the father was seeking to understand the son's perspective. The problem is that the girlfriend found out about the conversation and felt targeted. \n\nThe key point is whether the father had a duty to discuss this with the girlfriend first. Since the children are his from a previous marriage, maybe the father feels responsible to ensure their adjustment is good. However, the girlfriend might see this as questioning her role or competence. \n\nIn such cases, communication between partners is crucial. The father could have considered discussing his intentions with the girlfriend beforehand, to avoid misunderstandings. But the father's action was to check on the children's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's overreaction might be due to her own stress or feeling insecure. \n\nSo, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to ensure his son is adjusting well. However, the way he approached it without considering the girlfriend's feelings might have been a misstep. But the primary responsibility here is to the children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive given that the conversation was with the son about his feelings, not a critique of the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
