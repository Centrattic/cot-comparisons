My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author has two sons, 8 and 14. The older one had a conversation with the father about his feelings regarding his mom being away, the new girlfriend, and living arrangements. The father initiated this because he was concerned about the kids' adjustment and possible negative feelings towards the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are the father's intent and the girlfriend's reaction. The father's intention was to check in with his son to ensure he's okay, especially since the mother is away and the girlfriend is part of their lives now. The father mentions that he wanted to make sure he wasn't hurting the kids, which shows concern for their well-being.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt that the conversation was a criticism of her and that the father didn't have confidence in her. The father argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend. The question is whether that conversation was appropriate.\n\nLegally and in terms of parenting rights, parents typically have the right to discuss their children's lives with them, including relationships and living situations. The father's actions seem to be in the best interest of the children. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned, but that doesn't necessarily make the father wrong.\n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. The father could have considered the girlfriend's feelings and perhaps discussed the conversation with her afterward to explain his intentions. But the act of talking to his son about his perceptions is a valid parental duty. The girlfriend's response, while emotional, might be overreacting, but the father could have handled it more sensitively.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at intent and whether the person's actions were reasonable. Here, the father's intent was to check on his son's well-being, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the father isn't wrong for wanting to talk to his child. So the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong). But there's a nuance where the father could have handled the communication better. However, the core mistake isn't there. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
