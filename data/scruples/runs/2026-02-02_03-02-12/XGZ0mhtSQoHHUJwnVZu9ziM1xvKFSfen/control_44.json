My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a dad talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. From the original post, the dad has two sons, 8 and 14, and he's living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to help pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She reacted negatively, even calling him an asshole. Now, he's talked to his oldest son (probably the 14-year-old) about how he feels about the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined and accused the dad of not trusting her.\n\nSo the question is: is the dad the asshole here? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The dad's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings, which seems like a reasonable thing for a parent to do. After previous feedback on Reddit suggesting that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of interest, he wanted to make sure his son was okay. The dad argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined. She might see the conversation as the dad questioning her ability to care for the kids, especially since he asked her to take care of them earlier. Maybe she felt that discussing her in front of the child without her consent was a breach of trust. \n\nBut is the dad in the wrong? Well, parents have a responsibility to check in with their children about their well-being. The dad's approach seems to be about ensuring his son is okay, which is a legitimate concern. If the conversation was just about the son's feelings and not maliciously criticizing the girlfriend, then it's reasonable. The dad mentions the conversation was also about the mother being away, so maybe the focus wasn't entirely on the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend might have overreacted, but her feelings are valid if she felt disrespected. However, the dad isn't wrong about having the right to discuss his children's well-being with them. The key issue is whether he went behind her back. But parents usually don't need permission from their partner to talk to their kids. \n\nSo, considering all that, the dad isn't in the wrong. His actions were about his son's welfare, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional but doesn't make the dad the asshole. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
