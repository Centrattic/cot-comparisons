My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, but she was upset and called him an asshole. People commented that the kids might sense her not being fully engaged. So he talked to his oldest son (14) about his feelings towards the situation, including how he sees the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he had a duty to check in with his son about how he's adjusting, especially since the girlfriend is now part of their lives. He doesn't see it as undermining her and thinks he should be able to talk to his kids without prior approval. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, as a parent, he has the right to ensure his children are comfortable and adjusting well. Discussing the step-parent (girlfriend) in that context makes sense for the child's well-being. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the son without her knowledge could be seen as a lack of trust, especially if the conversation was critical or made the son feel uncertain. \n\nBut in this case, the author says the conversation was about both the mother (who's away) and the girlfriend. The son was happy with the arrangement, so maybe he was just getting his son's perspective. The key point is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was necessary for his well-being. The author likely did it to ensure the son isn't negatively affected by the dynamics, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She might feel that discussing her with the son is a breach of trust, especially if she's part of the household. Parents usually have the right to talk to their children about family matters, including step-parents, to ensure harmony. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she perceives it as a personal attack, which could be due to insecurity or communication issues in their relationship.\n\nSo, the author's action is reasonable from a parenting standpoint. Unless the conversation was critical or harmful, it's within his rights to check in with his son. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from personal issues rather than the action itself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong if his intention was to support his son's well-being without undermining the girlfriend. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's sensitivity to being discussed rather than the act itself.\n"
