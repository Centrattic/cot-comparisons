My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a father living with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to some conflict. Now, after getting advice that the kids might be picking up on the tension, the father talks to his oldest son (14 years old) about how he perceives the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend finds out and is upset, feeling undermined and that he doesn't trust her.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to check how the kids were feeling, which seems responsible. But the way he did it might be an issue. The girlfriend is hurt because he discussed her with the son without consulting her. The problem here is about communication and trust. Even though the father's intent was good, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with her in her absence is a breach of trust. The son is old enough to have such a conversation, but the father didn't coordinate with the girlfriend beforehand. \n\nIn relationships, especially with shared custody or co-parenting, communication is key. If the father had discussed his concerns about the kids' perceptions with the girlfriend first, maybe both could have been involved in the conversation with the son. By not doing so, he might have made her feel disrespected or not trusted. The girlfriend's reaction, while strong, might be partly due to feeling blindsided. \n\nThe father argues that he needs to talk to his kids without needing permission, which is valid to some extent. Parents should be able to communicate with their children. However, when the conversation involves a partner, especially in a shared living situation, it's important to maintain mutual respect and transparency. The father might have approached it as a necessary step, but the girlfriend's feelings are also valid. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the father's action wasn't intentionally harmful, but the lack of communication with his girlfriend before talking to the son about her could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) for not involving his girlfriend in the conversation beforehand, even if the intention was good.\n"
