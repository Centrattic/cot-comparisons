My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author has two boys, 8 and 14, and the girlfriend who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to her being upset and calling him an asshole. Then he had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son feels about the new situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got extremely upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to check in with his son about how the family changes are affecting him. As a parent, it's important to ensure the kids' well-being, especially during transitions like a parent's absence and a new partner moving in. The author didn't mention the girlfriend's feelings but focused on the child's perspective. However, the girlfriend perceived this as a lack of trust and confidence in her ability to be a part of the kids' lives.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author overstep by discussing the girlfriend in front of the child? Is it necessary to clear such conversations with a partner, especially when the child is involved? The author argues that he's a parent and needs to talk to his kids without prior approval. The girlfriend sees it as undermining her.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents do have the right to discuss their children's well-being with them, including any relevant adults in their lives. However, the manner and content of the conversation matter. If the author was critical of the girlfriend or made the child choose sides, that could be problematic. But he stated the conversation was balanced, discussing both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly due to insecurity or lack of communication. The author didn't intend to undermine but to ensure his son's adjustment. However, maybe the approach could have been discussed with the girlfriend first to avoid hurt feelings. But it's not clear if the conversation was negative. \n\nConsidering all this, the author wasn't wrong in talking to his son about the girlfriend. Parents should be able to discuss their children's feelings without prior approval. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own issues rather than the conversation itself. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
