My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend getting upset because he discussed her with their son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids a couple of days a week, which led to conflict. Now, the author is concerned about his children's well-being and decides to talk to his oldest son about how he feels regarding the mother's absence and the new girlfriend. The girlfriend reacts strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intent was to check in with his son about his emotional state, not to criticize the girlfriend. The conversation was part of a broader discussion about his mother being away. The girlfriend interprets this as a lack of confidence in her. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important for parents to communicate openly with their children about family dynamics. The author had a valid concern about his son's feelings and took the initiative to address it. However, the girlfriend felt that discussing her in front of the child was a betrayal. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Since the author's primary role is as a parent, ensuring the children's emotional well-being is a responsibility. Discussing family changes with the children is part of that. However, the method might have been an issue\u2014maybe the author should have discussed the approach with the girlfriend beforehand, especially since she's involved in the kids' lives. But the author's main duty is to his children, so initiating that conversation isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the author's action seems justified as a parent's duty.\n"
