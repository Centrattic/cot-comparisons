My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, thinking he undermined her. The author says he needed to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend first.\n\nSo, first, I need to break down the key points. The author has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, and she recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which she didn't like. Then, after getting advice from Reddit, he talked to his son about how he feels about the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend found out and got angry, saying he betrayed her. The author argues he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without her permission.\n\nNow, who's in the wrong? Well, from a parent's perspective, talking to your child about their feelings is generally considered important for their well-being. Parents have a right to check in with their kids, especially regarding their living situations and relationships. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel that discussing her in such a context without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her, especially if there's no prior communication.\n\nBut the author's intention was to check on his son's well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend. He mentioned the conversation was about both the ex-wife and the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but it's possible she felt disrespected. However, the author shouldn't need permission from his girlfriend to talk to his own child. That would be an overreach on her part. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend is entitled to her feelings, the author isn't in the wrong for engaging in a parental conversation with his son. The real issue might be the lack of communication between the author and his girlfriend. The author should have discussed his concerns with her first, but the act of talking to the child isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
