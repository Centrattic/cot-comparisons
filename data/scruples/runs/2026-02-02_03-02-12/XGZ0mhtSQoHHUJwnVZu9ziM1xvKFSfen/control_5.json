My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author thinks he's not the asshole because he needed to talk to his kids without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. The older son was asked about his thoughts on his mother being away and the stepmom. The author mentions that previous comments on Reddit suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of engagement, which he hadn't considered before. So he wanted to check in with his son. That seems like a responsible move as a parent to ensure the child is okay with the new living situation.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. She feels undermined because he talked to the son about her. But is it reasonable for the author to need to discuss his kids' feelings with them? As a parent, isn't it part of the role to communicate with children about their lives and family dynamics? The author didn't tell the son negative things about the girlfriend; he just asked for his perspective. The conversation was also about the mother's trip, so not solely about the girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that the author didn't respect her boundaries. If the author didn't discuss it with her beforehand, maybe there's a communication issue. But as an adult, the author has the right to talk to his own children without needing permission from a partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially since the conversation was part of the author trying to be a good parent, not to criticize the girlfriend.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a new relationship, and the kids are adjusting. The girlfriend might be feeling insecure or not fully integrated into the family. The author's action, while reasonable, could have been a trigger for her. But that doesn't make the author wrong. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity than the author's action. The author is trying to do what's best for the kids, which is a parent's duty.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his parental role by checking in with his child. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't mean the author did something wrong. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
