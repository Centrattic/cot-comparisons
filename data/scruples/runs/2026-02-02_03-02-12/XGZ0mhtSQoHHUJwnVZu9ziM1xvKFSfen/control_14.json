My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author (44M) living with his girlfriend (32F) and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids, which led to conflict. Then he talked to his oldest son (14) about how the son views the girlfriend and the situation, which the girlfriend found offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. He's trying to ensure his kids are okay, especially since there was feedback that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. Talking to the son is a natural parental responsibility. The son was happy, so maybe the parent was just checking in, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend is hurt and feels undermined. She might see the conversation as a lack of trust in her ability to be a good stepmother or part of the family. But as the parent, he has a right to discuss family matters with his children without needing permission from his partner, especially regarding their well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent overstepped. Since the conversation was about the kids' adjustment and the parent's role, not to criticize the girlfriend, it seems like a legitimate concern. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the parent's intent was to check on his children's feelings, which is a parent's duty. The answer likely leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
