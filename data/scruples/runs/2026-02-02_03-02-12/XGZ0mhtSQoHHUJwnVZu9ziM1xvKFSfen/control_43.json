My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent talking to their son about how the son perceives the parent's girlfriend. The parent's girlfriend is upset because they feel they were undermined. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. The parent wanted to check in with the child about how he's feeling with the new living situation, especially since the previous post mentioned that people suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance. The parent's reason was to ensure the kids weren't being affected negatively. That seems like a responsible action as a parent to monitor their child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is strong. She thinks the parent didn't have confidence in her and that it's a betrayal. The key here is whether the parent needed to discuss the girlfriend's role with the child without consulting her first. But parents do have a duty to talk to their children about their family dynamics, especially when it affects the kids. \n\nThe parent also mentions that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mother being away. So it's a balanced discussion. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but maybe she felt her boundaries were crossed. However, as a parent, you should be able to discuss your relationship with your kids without needing permission from a partner. \n\nI think the parent is acting in the child's best interest. While it's possible the approach could have been more sensitive, the core intent was to check on the child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about her insecurities or feeling undervalued rather than the action itself being wrong. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
