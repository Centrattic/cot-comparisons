My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author has two sons, ages 8 and 14. He mentions that the girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then, after considering feedback from Reddit comments about the kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of willingness, he talked to his oldest son (14) about his feelings regarding the situation, including the mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out, felt undermined, and left the house.\n\nFirst, the father's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. He wanted to ensure the kids aren't negatively affected by the situation. However, the girlfriend perceived this as undermining her authority or trust. The key points here are: \n\n1. Did the father overstep by discussing the girlfriend in front of his son? Parents often talk to their kids about family dynamics, especially when it affects them. But the son is 14, so it's reasonable for a parent to have open conversations.\n\n2. The girlfriend's reaction seems overly dramatic. She left the house and called the father a child, which might indicate insecurity or a lack of trust in the relationship. The father didn't intend to undermine her; he was focused on his son's feelings.\n\n3. The father argues that he's an adult and needs to communicate with his children without prior approval from his girlfriend. That makes sense because parents should have autonomy in discussing their family with their kids.\n\n4. The girlfriend's claim that the conversation was about her is true, but the father's main concern was the son's well-being, not criticizing the girlfriend. The son's perspective is important in such family dynamics.\n\nConsidering all this, the father acted as any responsible parent would\u2014ensuring his child's emotional state. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about personal insecurity than the father's wrongdoing. Therefore, the father isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
