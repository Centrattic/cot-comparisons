My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, thinking he undermined her, and now she's considering breaking up. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two teenage boys, one 8 and one 14. He's living with his girlfriend and his kids. The son was already mentioned in a previous post where the author asked the girlfriend to help with the kids, leading to an argument. Now, the author wanted to check in with his son about how he's feeling, especially after people on Reddit suggested that the kids might notice the girlfriend not being fully engaged. That makes sense because kids often pick up on family dynamics.\n\nThe author's intention was probably to ensure his son is okay and not being negatively affected. As a parent, talking to your child about their feelings is normal. He didn't go to undermine the girlfriend, he says. But the girlfriend took it as a betrayal. The problem is that the girlfriend might have felt insecure or not trusted, especially if there's already tension between the author and her. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, parents should be able to talk to their kids about various topics, including their caregivers. If the author's girlfriend feels that the conversation was an attack on her, maybe there's an issue with how he approached the conversation. Did he mention the girlfriend negatively? The author says the conversation was about the girlfriend as much as the mother's absence. If he was critical, that could be the issue. On the other hand, if he was just asking the son's opinion, that's part of parenting. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Leaving the house over this might indicate that she's sensitive or there's existing issues. But as adults, both should handle these situations maturely. The author might have handled it differently, maybe discussing with the girlfriend first, but he's not wrong to have the conversation for the son's sake. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's a parent trying to check on his child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is her responsibility. The answer is B.\n"
