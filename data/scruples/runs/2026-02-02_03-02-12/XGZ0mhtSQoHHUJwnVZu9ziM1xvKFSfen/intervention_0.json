My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, and she recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, he sat down with his oldest son to talk about how he perceives his mom being away, the new girlfriend, etc. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is arguing that he just needed to talk to his son about these family dynamics without needing her permission.\n\nThe key points to consider here are parental responsibility versus partner dynamics. As a parent, he has a duty to understand his children's well-being and how they're adjusting to the new living situation. Discussing this with his son is a natural part of parenting. However, the girlfriend might feel that her authority or position in the household is being questioned, especially since she's in a relationship with the father and might be sensitive about how the kids perceive her.\n\nThe author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a valid parent-child conversation. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not consulted about the conversation. But the author isn't wrong for communicating with his child about family matters. Parents should be able to discuss such things without needing approval from a partner, especially when it's about their child's emotional state.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say he should have included his girlfriend in the conversation or considered her feelings more. However, the author's primary responsibility is to his children. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and threatening to rethink the relationship over a discussion with the child is a significant overreaction. \n\nIn high school relationships, you might expect such drama, but here, the author is an adult with kids. The girlfriend's response seems immature given the circumstances. The author acted appropriately in his role as a parent, and the girlfriend's reaction is more indicative of her own issues than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
