My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and two sons. He asked his girlfriend to help with picking up the kids from school, which led to a conflict. Now, he's talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend, and the girlfriend found out and is upset.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author did something wrong by discussing his girlfriend with his son. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's intention: he wanted to check in with his son to make sure he's okay with the living situation and his feelings towards the girlfriend. That seems reasonable, as a parent should be concerned about their child's well-being. However, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nBut the author is an adult, and discussing his children with them is part of his parental responsibilities. Should he have to clear every conversation with his girlfriend first? That might be an overreach. On the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the conversation differently, perhaps not focusing too much on the girlfriend's role. \n\nThe key is whether the author's actions were a breach of trust. If the author didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend and the conversation was about the child's well-being overall, including the mother and the girlfriend, then he might not be in the wrong. But if the conversation was meant to criticize the girlfriend or make the child take sides, that would be different. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. It's possible the author is not in the wrong (B) because he was acting in the best interest of his child, and as a parent, he has the right to discuss such matters without needing permission. However, maybe the author should have been more discreet. But given the context, the author's action seems justified.\n"
