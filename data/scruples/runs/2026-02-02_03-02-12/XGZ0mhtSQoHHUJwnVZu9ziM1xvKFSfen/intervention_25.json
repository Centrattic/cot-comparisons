My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids and is in a relationship with his girlfriend. He wanted to check in with his son about how he's feeling, especially after previous feedback suggested the kids might be picking up on the girlfriend's negative attitude. The author's intention was to ensure his son isn't being affected negatively. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author overstep by discussing the girlfriend with the son? The author mentions that the conversation was also about his son's mother and her absence. So it's not just about the girlfriend. The son seemed okay, which is positive. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. She feels betrayed. This suggests that the author might have breached trust. Even if the intention was good, the girlfriend might have expected that discussing her with the child without her knowledge would be hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed he could talk to his son about anything, but involving the girlfriend in such a way without her input could be seen as a mistake. Even if the son is happy, the girlfriend's feelings are valid here. Trust and how each partner feels respected in the relationship matter. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to check in with his son, he might have neglected to consider the girlfriend's perspective. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the action, though well-meaning, could be seen as undermining the girlfriend. However, some might argue B because parents should be able to talk to their kids. But the girlfriend's strong reaction and the potential breach of trust tip the balance towards A.\n"
