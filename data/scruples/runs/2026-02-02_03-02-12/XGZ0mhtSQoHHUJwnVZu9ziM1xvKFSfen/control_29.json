My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong after talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and the girlfriend lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Then, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the living situation, the girlfriend, and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's a parent and needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend. He says the conversation was also about his ex-wife's absence, not just the girlfriend. He feels he's not the asshole because it's about his kids' well-being.\n\nSo, the key points to consider here are: Parental rights vs. partner's feelings. As a parent, it's reasonable to discuss family matters with your children. However, the girlfriend might feel that talking about her specifically could affect her relationship with the kids or her standing in the household. The author didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend, but the girlfriend took it as a personal attack. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, parents should be able to talk to their kids about family dynamics. But maybe the way he approached it could have been more sensitive. The problem might be communication style or the content of the conversation. However, the author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a valid parental concern. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if the conversation was meant to be open and honest. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel insecure or mistrustful. If the author hadn't discussed this before, maybe there's a history of not addressing these topics. But as an adult, the girlfriend could have handled it better, especially if the conversation was necessary for the child's well-being. The author isn't wrong for wanting to know how his child feels about the new living arrangements. \n\nOn the other hand, if the conversation was critical of the girlfriend, that could be an issue. The author says it was as much about the mother's absence as the girlfriend, so maybe that's balanced. Still, the girlfriend's reaction seems out of proportion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's a parent addressing his child's needs, which is his right. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurities than the action itself. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
