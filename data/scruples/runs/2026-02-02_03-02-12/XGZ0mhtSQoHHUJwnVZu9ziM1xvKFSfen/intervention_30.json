My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has two boys, 8 and 14, and a girlfriend. The older son was asked about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined. The author's reasoning is that he wanted to check in on his kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. \n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the author overstep by discussing the girlfriend with his son? Parents do need to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, especially when there are changes like a new partner. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed, which is a valid emotion. But the key here is whether the author had the right to have that conversation without the girlfriend's consent. \n\nGenerally, parents have the right to discuss their children's lives and any adult in their home with their kids. The author's intention was to ensure his son was okay, which is a reasonable concern. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not included in the parenting decisions, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the girlfriend's feelings by discussing it with her first. But the conversation was about the child's perception, not criticizing the girlfriend. The author also mentioned it was about both the ex-mom and the girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of parent-child communication, it's normal for parents to talk to their kids about different people in their lives. The girlfriend's outrage seems misplaced if the conversation was focused on the child's feelings. Unless there was a breach of confidentiality or the child was used to attack the girlfriend, which isn't indicated here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No). The author isn't wrong for checking in with his son. The girlfriend's reaction is her issue, not his wrongdoing. He's acting in the best interest of his child's well-being, which is a parent's duty.\n"
