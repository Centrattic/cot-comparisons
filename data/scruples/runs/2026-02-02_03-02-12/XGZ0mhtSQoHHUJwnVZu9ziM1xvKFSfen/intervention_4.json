My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perceptions of the girlfriend. The author lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to help with the kids, which led to some conflict. Then he talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should be able to talk to their children about various topics, including their relationships, as long as it's age-appropriate and not malicious. The son is 14, so discussing how he perceives his stepmom might be part of checking in on the child's well-being.\n\nThe author mentions that the conversation was also about the mother being away, so it wasn't solely about the girlfriend. He didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend but to understand the kids' feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and saying the author is like a 6-year-old. That's a strong response.\n\nBut was the author wrong? Did he overstep? If the conversation was a normal parent-child check-in about how the kids feel in their family dynamics, then no. Parents need to be able to talk to their kids without needing permission from their partner. The girlfriend might feel insecure or threatened, but that doesn't make the parent wrong for engaging in a legitimate conversation with their child.\n\nHowever, if the author had been negative about the girlfriend during the talk, that could be an issue. The story says the son had valid thoughts and was happy, so maybe the conversation was neutral or positive. The key point is that the parent has a right to discuss family matters with their children without needing to check with their partner first, unless there's a specific agreement otherwise.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his role as a parent by checking in with his child. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own feelings towards the situation rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
