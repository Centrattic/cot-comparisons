My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend. The previous situation involved the author asking the girlfriend to pick up the kids, which she took offense to, calling him an asshole. Now, after some comments from Reddit users, the author had a conversation with his son about the girlfriend, the mother, and the situation. The girlfriend found out and got upset, saying he undermined her and needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's handling the mother being away and how he perceives the new living situation. He didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend, and he's a parent who needs to communicate with his children. The girlfriend felt betrayed and that he lacks confidence in her, which is a valid emotional response. But the key here is whether the author overstepped.\n\nParents have a responsibility to talk to their kids about their family dynamics, especially if there are potential issues. However, the way the conversation was handled might affect the outcome. If the author was neutral and just seeking the child's perspective, then it's reasonable. But if he was negative or implied that the girlfriend wasn't good enough, that would be different. The author mentions the conversation was as much about the mother as the girlfriend, so maybe he was balanced. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Leaving the house and wanting to rethink the relationship over a parental conversation might be a sign of insecurity or poor communication in their relationship. The author is an adult and has the right to discuss his kids' well-being with them. The girlfriend's claim that he doesn't have confidence in her might not hold if the conversation was just about the kids' feelings. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions seem justified. The girlfriend's overreaction is more about their relationship issues rather than the parent's duty. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
