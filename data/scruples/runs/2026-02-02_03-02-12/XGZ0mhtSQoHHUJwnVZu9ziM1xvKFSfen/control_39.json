My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a father living with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, he's talking to his son about how the kid perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because he needed to talk to his kids about important matters like their mom being away and the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. As a parent, he has a responsibility to his children's well-being. Talking to his son about how he sees his stepmom (the girlfriend) and the situation with their mom (the son's biological mother) being away could be a way to check in on how the kids are handling the family changes. That seems like a reasonable parental action. He mentions the conversation was as much about the mother's trip as about the girlfriend, so it's not like he was focusing solely on criticizing his girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She feels that talking to the son about her was an act of undermining her and a betrayal. That's a valid concern because involving the child in a way that could be perceived as questioning the caregiver's role might affect the child's relationship with the caregiver. There's a potential for the child to feel caught in the middle or that the parent is not fully supportive of the other adult in the household.\n\nBut here's the thing: the parent's intention was to understand how his children were coping, not to criticize the girlfriend. The key here is whether he overstepped by discussing the girlfriend's role in their lives. If the conversation was open and honest, and not leading the child to feel that he should take a side or criticize his stepmom, then it's more about ensuring the child's emotional well-being. On the other hand, if the parent was using the child as a way to gather information to later challenge the girlfriend, that would be problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her authority or role in the family is being questioned. However, the parent should be able to talk to his children without needing permission from a partner. It's part of his parental duties to check in with them. That being said, maybe he could have handled the conversation more sensitively, framing it in a way that doesn't make the child feel like he's being used as a go-between. Also, addressing the girlfriend's feelings after the fact might have been necessary to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nIn terms of the relationship between the author and his girlfriend, communication is key. If the author had discussed his plans to talk to the kids with his girlfriend beforehand, maybe they could have found a way to approach it that respects both their positions. But since he didn't, the girlfriend's feeling of betrayal is understandable. However, the necessity of the parent to check in with his children takes precedence. The boyfriend's actions weren't malicious, but the way he handled it might have caused the girlfriend to feel disrespected.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the parent did what he needed to do for his kids, but perhaps didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective enough. However, he's not obligated to clear every conversation with his partner before talking to his children. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the parent's action is justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
