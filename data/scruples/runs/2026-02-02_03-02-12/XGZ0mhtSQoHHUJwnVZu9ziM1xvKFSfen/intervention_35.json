My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and left, saying the author undermined her. The author argues he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being without needing permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibilities. Parents usually have the right to discuss their children's lives and family dynamics with their kids. The author was concerned about his children's adjustment, especially after his girlfriend lost her job and was taking on more responsibility. He talked to his son to understand his feelings, which seems reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but maybe she felt disrespected.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author overstepped. The conversation was about the son's perception of both his mother's absence and the girlfriend. Since the author was trying to ensure the kids are okay, it's a valid action. However, maybe he should have considered the girlfriend's feelings more. But as an adult, she should accept that parents need to check in with their children. The author didn't discuss the girlfriend negatively; he just asked the son's opinion. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
