My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids, which she didn't like. Then he talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author thinks he's not wrong because he needed to talk to his kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. As a parent, does he have the right to talk to his kids about their living arrangements and family members? The main point is whether discussing the girlfriend with the son was inappropriate. The author's intention was to check how the kids are feeling, which is a valid parental concern. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed because the topic included her. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions the conversation was also about the mother's trip. So maybe the issue is the inclusion of the girlfriend in the discussion without her knowing. The girlfriend might feel that being discussed without her presence is a breach of trust. But on the other hand, the author is a parent, so talking to his kids about family matters is part of his role. \n\nThe key point is whether the parent's conversation with his child about the girlfriend was necessary and respectful. If the son volunteered opinions about the girlfriend, it's different than the parent leading the conversation to critique her. The author says he asked the son what he thinks of the girlfriend, which could be seen as seeking the child's perspective, which is okay. However, if the parent is using the child to validate his own feelings or to criticize the girlfriend, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the author's main concern was the kids' well-being, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially since she's an adult in a relationship with the parent. However, the parent did involve the child in a discussion about the girlfriend, which might make the girlfriend feel disrespected. But since the parent is the child's guardian, it's part of parenting to discuss family dynamics. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the parent's actions were justified. The parent's intention was to ensure the children's well-being, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling criticized, but the parent isn't wrong for checking in with his child. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. If the parent was using the child to undermine the girlfriend, that's an issue. But based on the description, the parent was concerned about the kids' feelings, so it's more about proper parenting. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. The girlfriend might feel that the parent didn't discuss the conversation with her first. However, as a parent, he isn't required to clear every conversation with his partner about his children. It's about the child's welfare first. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
