My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the kid perceives the girlfriend. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a father with two kids, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, and she got upset, calling him an asshole. Now, he had a conversation with his oldest son about how the kid feels regarding his mom being away, living with the dad, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is furious, feeling undermined and that he lacks confidence in her. She left to stay with a friend and questioned their relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his son about these issues because he's a parent and should be able to discuss his children's well-being without needing permission from his girlfriend. He also mentions that the conversation was about both the mother's situation and the girlfriend, not just undermining her.\n\nIs talking to his son about his girlfriend in the presence of the child inappropriate? Well, parents often have to talk to their kids about various family dynamics, especially when there are significant changes like a parent moving out or a new caregiver. The key here is how the conversation was approached. The author says he did it to check in on his son's feelings and that he realized the importance of considering the kids' perspectives after previous advice. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed and that her position was undermined. \n\nIn some cases, involving a child in discussions about a new partner can make the child feel like a go-between or create pressure. The father's intention was to assess his son's well-being, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt this was a betrayal. It might depend on the context of their relationship: if they were in a committed relationship, maybe the father should have discussed with her first about having such a conversation. But as a parent, he has the right to talk to his child about family matters that affect them. \n\nThe girlfriend's response seems extreme. Calling him a 6-year-old and needing to rethink the relationship might be an overreaction. The author isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily unethical; he's a parent trying to ensure his child is okay. But maybe the way he approached the conversation could have been better. Did he ask the son about the girlfriend in a way that could make the girlfriend feel targeted? The author claims it was balanced, but the girlfriend's reaction indicates she felt targeted.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the father's intent was purely to understand his son's feelings and he did so in a respectful way, then he's not in the wrong. However, perhaps he should have considered discussing with the girlfriend first, especially since they live together and she's involved in the kids' care. But the father isn't obligated to consult his girlfriend on every parent-child conversation. The main issue is the girlfriend's reaction being disproportionate. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's fulfilling his role as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction might be the problem here.\n"
