My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset and thinks he undermined her, calling him an asshole. \n\nFirst, the context: The author has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, and she recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. In the previous Reddit post, people suggested that the kids might be picking up on the girlfriend not being fully engaged. The author then talked to his oldest son about his feelings regarding his mother, the new situation, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, thinking the author didn't trust her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The author talked to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend. 2) The girlfriend felt this was an attack and a betrayal. \n\nNow, considering parent-child relationships, parents have a right to talk to their children about family dynamics, especially when it involves their well-being. The author's intention was to check in on his son's adjustment and ensure he wasn't being negatively affected by the changes (his mother being away, living with the girlfriend, etc.). The conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also included his ex-wife's absence. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She accuses the author of undermining her, but the author's action was a parental duty to understand his child's perspective. Parents often discuss such matters with their kids without prior permission from the other parent, especially when the child is old enough (14 years old in this case). \n\nPossible issues could be if the conversation was malicious or if the author shared the son's comments with the girlfriend in a way that was critical. However, the author states the conversation was about both the son's mother and the girlfriend, indicating a balanced approach. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling threatened, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author acted in his son's best interest. The girlfriend's emotional response is valid in that she might feel hurt, but the author isn't at fault for fulfilling his role as a parent. There's no indication he intended to harm her. The conflict here is more about the girlfriend's feelings versus the parent's duty. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
