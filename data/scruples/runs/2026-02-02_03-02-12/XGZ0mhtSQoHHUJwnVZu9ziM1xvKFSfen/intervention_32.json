My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a father who talks to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend reacts strongly, feeling undermined. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the father's intention: he wanted to understand his son's feelings about the living arrangements and the girlfriend. He did this because people on Reddit pointed out that kids might sense if a caregiver isn't fully committed. He checked in with the oldest son, who is 14, which is an age where kids can have thoughtful opinions. The son was happy, so the father's action seems well-intentioned.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction: she feels her autonomy and relationship with the father are being questioned. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. She perceives the conversation as a betrayal and lack of confidence in her. \n\nBut the father argues that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without permission. The key here is whether discussing the daughter's perception with the child is an overstep. Parents often talk to children about various family dynamics, including new caregivers, to ensure the kids' well-being. The father's conversation was about both the ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend. So, it's part of a normal parental concern for the child's adjustment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems excessive. While it's valid to communicate concerns, storming off and threatening the relationship over a conversation about the child's feelings might be a disproportionate response. However, the father could have approached it more sensitively. Maybe he should have discussed with his girlfriend first, but the scenario doesn't mention any prior issues. The father's right as a parent to check in with his children isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's insecurity might be a bigger issue here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's action is justified. The problem might stem from the girlfriend's insecurity rather than the father's intent. Unless there were other factors not mentioned, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
