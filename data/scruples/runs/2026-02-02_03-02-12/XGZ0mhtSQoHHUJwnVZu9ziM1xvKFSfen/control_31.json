My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has two kids, 8 and 14 years old, and lives with his girlfriend. The main issue is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and left, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son is 14, which is an age where kids are starting to have more mature thoughts. The author had a conversation with his son to check in on how the son feels about his mother (who isn't present) and his stepmother (the girlfriend). The author did this because previous Reddit comments suggested that the kids might be sensing tension or the girlfriend not being fully committed. The author wanted to make sure he wasn't harming his kids by having the girlfriend in their lives.\n\nThe girlfriend, however, took offense. She felt that by talking to the son about her, the author didn't trust her and that this conversation undermined her. She left to stay with a friend and is re-evaluating the relationship. The author argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend, especially regarding their well-being.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points seem to be about communication and trust. The author's intention was to ensure his kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the way he approached it might have been a misstep. If the author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend beforehand, even though he had a valid reason, it could come across as not respecting her role in the kids' lives. But he also has a right to check in with his children about their feelings, especially when there are concerns about their adjustment to the new living situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, suggesting she felt betrayed. That might indicate deeper issues in their relationship, like a lack of communication or trust. If the author had been open with his girlfriend about the reasons behind the conversation, maybe the conflict could have been avoided. However, the author's primary concern was his children's welfare, which is a legitimate priority.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was to protect his children's emotional well-being. While it's important for the author to communicate with his girlfriend about such matters, the act of talking to his son itself isn't inherently wrong. The problem may lie in the lack of prior discussion with his girlfriend. But given that the conversation was about the kids' feelings, the author might not be in the wrong. It's a gray area, but the intention matters. If the author's goal was to ensure his kids are okay, he's not the asshole. The girlfriend's overreaction might be due to her own insecurities or communication issues in the relationship.\n"
