My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a parent with two kids, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, and she called him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son to check in on how the kids are feeling about the situation, especially the new living arrangements. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend was appropriate. The author's intention was to understand his son's feelings, which is a valid parental concern. Parents often talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including relationships. But the girlfriend took it as a personal attack, feeling that he lacks confidence in her. \n\nNow, considering boundaries: The author is talking to his son about his girlfriend, but he's asking the son his own thoughts. The son's perspective is about how he feels, not just about the girlfriend but also about his mother being away. The author mentions that the conversation was balanced, not just about the girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She felt betrayed and left the house. The question is whether the author overstepped. In most cases, a parent has the right to discuss family matters with their children, especially regarding their well-being. But the way the conversation was handled might matter. If the author was critical of the girlfriend in front of the child or made the child feel like a spy, that could be problematic. But according to the post, the author was just asking the son about his perceptions, not badmouthing the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling undermined. Maybe she felt that the author didn't trust her to be a good caretaker for the kids. But parents should be able to assess their children's feelings about the household dynamics. It's part of being a responsible parent to ensure the kids are adjusting well. \n\nAnother angle: Communication between the author and his girlfriend. If the author hadn't discussed this with the girlfriend beforehand, maybe there was a lack of communication. However, the author is talking to his son to get his son's perspective, not to criticize the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling insecure or not being trusted, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to check in with his child. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the parent. It's his role to ensure the kids' emotional health. Discussing how the kids feel about the new situation is appropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own feelings of being judged, but the author isn't in the wrong for fulfilling his parental duty. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He acted as a responsible parent by checking in with his child, and the girlfriend's reaction might be more about her insecurities or miscommunication rather than the author doing something wrong.\n"
