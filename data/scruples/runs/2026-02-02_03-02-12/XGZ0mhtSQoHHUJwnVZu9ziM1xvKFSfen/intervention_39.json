My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, thinking he undermined her. The author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since the girlfriend was now living with them and the kids' mom was away. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two kids, and as a parent, he's responsible for their emotional state. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author is supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids, but she reacted negatively. Now, he's tried to check in with his son to see how he's feeling, which seems like a responsible parent action. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014calling him an asshole, leaving the house, saying he betrayed her. That's a strong reaction. But did the author do something wrong? The key point is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend is an overstep. As a parent, discussing family matters with children is usually necessary, especially when their well-being is a concern. The author mentioned it was about both the girlfriend and the mother being away, so it's part of the kids' lives.\n\nHowever, maybe the way he approached the conversation could have been better. Did he consult the girlfriend first? The author says he didn't clear it with her, but he argues that as a parent, he shouldn't need permission. There's a balance between being a parent and respecting the partner's feelings. If the conversation was critical or made the girlfriend feel undermined, that's a problem. But if it was just a normal parental check-in, it's reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but people can be sensitive. The author might have handled it differently, like discussing with the girlfriend first to explain his intent. Still, the author's primary responsibility is to his children. The question is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend is inherently wrong. Since the author's intention was to ensure the kids' adjustment, I think he's not in the wrong. The issue might be more about communication between the author and his girlfriend rather than the act itself. So answer B.\n"
