My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The father has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then he talked to his son about how the son feels about his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really angry, saying he undermined her.\n\nThe father's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. He didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, but the father feels he's justified because he's a parent. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend is wrong. Parents often need to discuss family matters with their children, especially when a new partner is involved. The father's concern is about the kids' adjustment and their feelings, which is important. However, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she feels betrayed. \n\nBut is the father wrong? Well, as a parent, he has the right and responsibility to communicate with his children about their lives and family dynamics. The girlfriend might be sensitive because she feels insecure or not trusted. But the father isn't doing anything unethical or legally wrong. The question is about social wrongness. \n\nThe key factors: The father's intent was to understand his son's feelings, not to criticize the girlfriend. The conversation was about the kids' adjustment, including the girlfriend's role. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't make the father wrong. In relationships, especially with co-parenting, there's a balance between parental responsibility and partner dynamics. \n\nSo, the father is not wrong in talking to his son. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the father's action is justified as part of his parental duty. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
