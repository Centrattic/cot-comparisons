My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to a conflict. Now, he talked to his son about the situation, including his girlfriend, and the girlfriend took it as an attack on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is whether a parent should be allowed to discuss their children's feelings about different people in their lives, including a partner. The author's intention was to check in with his son to ensure he wasn't being negatively affected by the situation. That seems like a responsible move as a parent. However, the girlfriend felt undermined and that her trust was violated.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions and the context. The author mentions that he had valid reasons\u2014checking on his son's well-being and understanding his perspective. He didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to get his thoughts. The girlfriend's reaction is intense; she feels betrayed and says the author has low maturity. But is the author wrong for discussing his kids' feelings with them? Parents typically talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including relationships, to ensure the kids are okay.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have been more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings when bringing up the topic. However, the author also states that the conversation was as much about his ex-wife's trip as it was about the girlfriend. So, it wasn't a one-sided attack. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme given that discussing a child's feelings is a normal parental responsibility.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have handled it differently, perhaps by discussing with the girlfriend first if there were concerns. But the act of talking to his son is not inherently wrong. The girlfriend's insecurity and taking it personally might be the issue here. The author's primary role is to his children, so ensuring their emotional well-being is a priority.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
