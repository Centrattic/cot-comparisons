My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a dad with two kids and a girlfriend, had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined. The author is now asking Reddit if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a conversation with his son about the girlfriend. The main concern here is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend is appropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is that she feels undermined and that her relationship with the kids is being questioned. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since the kids' mother is away and the girlfriend is now the primary caregiver.\n\nSo, as a parent, it's generally expected that you can talk to your children about family dynamics, especially when there are changes like a new caregiver. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings and ensure he wasn't being negatively affected by the situation. That seems reasonable. However, the girlfriend felt that this conversation was an attack on her. The author didn't go to the kids to undermine her, but the girlfriend perceived it that way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author overstepped. Parents usually have the right to discuss family matters with their children. But there's also the aspect of communication between the parents. The author didn't consult with the girlfriend before talking to the son. Even if he had good intentions, not discussing this with her first might have caused hurt feelings. If the author had communicated with the girlfriend about his intentions, maybe they could have avoided the conflict. But the author's perspective is that he needed to prioritize his kids' well-being without needing permission from his partner.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's reaction. She left the house and called him a 6-year-old, which seems extreme. However, her feeling that her competence as a caregiver is being questioned is valid. If the author had approached it by saying, \"I want to make sure you're both comfortable with each other,\" it might have been received better. But the way it was done without prior communication could have been seen as a betrayal.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as necessary for his children's well-being, but his failure to communicate with his girlfriend first might be where he went wrong. However, it's also about the balance between a parent's right to talk to their kids and the partner's feelings. The author is not the one causing harm by talking to his kids, but the lack of communication with his girlfriend could be a point of contention. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's possible he's not in the wrong for talking to his son, but perhaps he should have discussed it with his girlfriend first. But the Reddit community often leans towards considering the intentions and whether the action is inherently wrong. \n\nIn the context of the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, the key is whether the action is considered asshole behavior. If the author's intention was to check on his son's well-being without malicious intent towards the girlfriend, then maybe he's not the asshole. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but that doesn't necessarily make him right. However, the author's action in itself is a reasonable parental check-in. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
