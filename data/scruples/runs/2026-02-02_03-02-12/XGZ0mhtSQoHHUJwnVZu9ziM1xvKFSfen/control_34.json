My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and accused him of undermining her, leading her to leave the house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The father has two sons, ages 8 and 14. He lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job, and he supports her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to a conflict previously. Now, after some feedback from Reddit, he decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how the son feels about his mother being away, living with the father, and his feelings about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really angry, feeling undermined and accused the father of lacking confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend.\n\nThe father's argument is that he needed to talk to his children without needing permission from his girlfriend. He feels that he's an adult and has a right to discuss his kids' well-being with them. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, breaking it down: Is it wrong for a parent to talk to their child about their family dynamics, including their step-parent or partner? Well, parents generally have the right to communicate with their children about family matters. However, the girlfriend might feel that this conversation was a critique of her role or a lack of trust. The father's intention was to check in on the child's feelings, but the girlfriend perceived it as undermining her. \n\nThe key points to consider are the intent and the context. The father's intention was to ensure his child's well-being and to address any potential negative effects from the previous situation. He didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to discuss family dynamics. However, the way he approached it might have made the girlfriend feel disrespected or not trusted. \n\nIn a relationship, communication is crucial. If the father had discussed with his girlfriend first why he wanted to talk to the son about her, maybe it would have been handled better. But on the other hand, the father is responsible for his children's emotional state, and consulting with his kids is part of that responsibility. \n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend's reaction was overly sensitive, but her feelings are valid. The father might have considered her perspective more before having the conversation, even though the conversation itself was necessary. He's not in the wrong for talking to his son, but perhaps could have handled the communication with the girlfriend first to avoid conflict. However, the main issue here is whether the act of talking to his son was wrong. Since it's his role as a parent to check in with his child's feelings, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about how she interpreted the conversation rather than the conversation itself being wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
