My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a father, had a conversation with his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her, and now the author is wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author lives with his girlfriend and his kids. The girlfriend lost her job and the father supports her. He asked her to pick up the kids some days, which she was upset about. Then, after some feedback from Reddit comments, he talked to his son about how things are going, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was very upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nNow, the key points here are the father's intent and the girlfriend's reaction. The father's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being and how he perceives the new living situation. He didn't mean to undermine the girlfriend; he even mentions it was about his ex-wife's absence as well. The girlfriend took it as a lack of confidence in her and a betrayal.\n\nThe question is whether the father is wrong. Well, as a parent, he has a responsibility to ensure his children's emotional well-being. Talking to his son about how he feels is a normal parenting activity. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly because she felt her position was being questioned without her consent. But the father isn't required to discuss every conversation with his girlfriend about his kids. Unless there was a prior agreement that they wouldn't talk about the partner in front of the kids, the father's actions seem reasonable.\n\nHowever, maybe the way he approached the conversation could have been considerate. If the father had included the girlfriend in the conversation or discussed it with her first, that might have avoided the conflict. But the father's main concern was the kids, not undermining the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own insecurities or how the conversation was framed.\n\nIn terms of whether it's the father's fault, the answer could hinge on context. If the father and girlfriend had a prior understanding about discussing her in front of the kids, then maybe. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The father is acting in the best interest of his children, which is a valid reason. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here about communication. The father might have handled it better, but being in the wrong for checking on his child's feelings would be tough to justify. The girlfriend's overreaction is more concerning.\n"
