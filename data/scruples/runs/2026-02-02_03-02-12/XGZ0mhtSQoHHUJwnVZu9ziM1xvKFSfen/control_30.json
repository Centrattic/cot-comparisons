My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation involves the author having a conversation with his oldest son (14 years old) about how he perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her, and left to stay with a friend.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings about the living arrangements and the girlfriend. He mentions it was a wake-up call after Reddit comments suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. He wanted to ensure his kids were okay. That seems like a responsible parent action. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014feeling undermined, betrayed, comparing the author to a 6-year-old. But is her reaction justified? Well, talking to your child about the person you're in a relationship with is usually a normal part of co-parenting or step-parenting dynamics. Especially when the child is a teenager, having such conversations is part of helping them navigate the family situation. The author didn't say he criticized the girlfriend; he just discussed her presence and compared her to the mother. The key here is intent versus perception. The author's intent was to understand his son's perspective, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her consent could affect the child's perception of her. But in many cases, parents do talk to their kids about other adults in their lives, especially if those adults are part of the household. The author did not go to the son to criticize the girlfriend; he was seeking his son's input. \n\nThe author is an adult with children, and part of parenting is balancing the needs of the children with the needs of the partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme given that the author was fulfilling his role as a parent. The question is whether talking to the child about the step-parent is a breach of trust. Since the child is his son and the author's responsibility, it's generally acceptable unless there's a prior agreement not to discuss such matters. The girlfriend might need to communicate her boundaries better if she has concerns about how she's portrayed to the children. \n\nThe author's reasoning that he shouldn't need to clear every conversation with his girlfriend about his kids makes sense. It's part of maintaining a healthy parent-child relationship. Unless there's a specific reason to believe the conversation would harm the girlfriend's standing with the child, the author's action seems justified. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were in the best interest of his child to ensure he's adjusting well. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or lack of communication, but the author isn't in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
