My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the boy perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and after some conflict about her watching the kids, he talked to his oldest son about how the son feels about the current living situation and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had a conversation with his son about the girlfriend, which the girlfriend took as a betrayal. The main question is whether the author was wrong to do so. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's generally considered important for parents to communicate openly with their children, especially regarding their well-being and family dynamics. The author was concerned about how his son was perceiving the changes in family structure, like the mother being away and the new girlfriend. He wanted to ensure his son wasn't being negatively affected. That seems like a responsible action as a parent to check in on the child's feelings.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. She might feel that the conversation was a criticism of her, even if the author intended it as a neutral check-in. The problem here could be communication. The author didn't clear it with the girlfriend beforehand, which might have caused her to feel disrespected or doubted in her ability to care for the kids. But the author argues that he's an adult and needs to be able to talk to his kids without prior approval, which makes sense because parental responsibilities don't require a partner's permission.\n\nThe key issue is whether the conversation was inappropriate. The author's intent was to assess his son's feelings, which is a valid parent-child discussion. The girlfriend's perception of being undermined might be due to how the conversation was framed or her own insecurities. However, the author's actions were primarily about his child's welfare, not to criticize the girlfriend directly. \n\nIn such situations, it's possible that both parties have valid points. The author is right in needing to communicate with his children, but perhaps could have approached the conversation in a way that minimized the girlfriend's discomfort, maybe by explaining the purpose better afterward. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be over-the-top, but her feelings are real and important to address. \n\nSince the author's primary duty is to his children's well-being, and talking to them about their feelings is a reasonable action, the answer likely leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong). The mistake might be in not managing the relationship dynamics better, but the act of talking to the son isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about relationship issues rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
