My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and his ex-wife. The girlfriend lost her job and was asked to help with the kids, which led to conflict. The author then talked to his 14-year-old son about how he feels about his mom being away, the living arrangement, and his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined. \n\nNow, from a parenting perspective, it's important for parents to communicate openly with their children, especially about family dynamics. The author's intention was to understand his son's feelings, which is a responsible action. The son was happy with the situation, so the conversation probably helped the author confirm that he's not negatively affecting his kids.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt betrayed because the conversation was about her. That's a valid emotional response. But the author didn't have malicious intent. He's a parent, so talking to his kids about their lives and family is part of his role. It's reasonable for him to discuss how the kids feel about the new living arrangements, including the girlfriend's role.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to parent, his intent to check on his son's well-being, and the girlfriend's reaction being emotional but not necessarily justified. The author didn't go behind the girlfriend's back maliciously; he just wanted to ensure his son's feelings were considered.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's reaction is understandable, the author isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his parental duties, and it's expected that he communicates with his children. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity than the author's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
