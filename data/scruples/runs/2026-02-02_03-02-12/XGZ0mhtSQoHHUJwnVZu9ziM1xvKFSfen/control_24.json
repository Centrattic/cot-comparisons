My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. From the story, the author has two sons and a girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school. She was upset and called him an asshole. Then, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got extremely upset, feeling undermined and insulted. She left the house to stay with a friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author talked to his son about the girlfriend without consulting her first. The girlfriend took it as a betrayal and a lack of confidence in her. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids because they might sense her discomfort, which was pointed out in previous comments. He felt it was necessary for their well-being.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Parents need to be able to communicate with their children about various aspects of their lives, especially when it involves people living in the household. The author wanted to check in with his son about how he felt about the new living arrangements and the girlfriend's role. That seems like a responsible act as a parent to ensure the kids are okay. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is also valid. She might feel that discussing her in front of the child, even if it's in a non-critical way, could affect the child's perception of her. There's a balance between a parent's duty to their children and respecting the partner's feelings. \n\nHowever, the author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend; he wanted to understand the son's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if the conversation was neutral and aimed at the child's well-being. The author is an adult, and talking to his children is part of parenting. The girlfriend's response might be overreacting, especially as adults should handle such situations maturely. \n\nBut maybe the author should have discussed his intention to talk to the son with the girlfriend beforehand? However, in some cases, parents need to make decisions without consulting others, especially regarding their children. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role is being questioned. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by talking to his son. It's a parent's right to check in with their kids about their environment. The girlfriend's feelings are hurt, but that doesn't make the author the asshole unless he intended to undermine her. Since the author's intention was to understand his son's perspective, not to criticize the girlfriend, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction is the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
