My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves talking to his son about his girlfriend and how the son perceives her. The author's girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined.\n\nFirst, the author had a conversation with his son about his girlfriend and the arrangement where she was supposed to pick up the kids. The son's mother isn't in the picture as she's away. The author did this because some people in his previous post suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness. He wanted to check in on his kids' feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she left the house and said the author betrayed her. She felt he didn't have confidence in her. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being and the family dynamics without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the rights and responsibilities here. Parents have a duty to ensure their children's emotional well-being. Talking to his son about the family situation, including the girlfriend's role, seems within his right as a parent. The author mentions the conversation was also about the mother's trip, not just the girlfriend. So, it's not like he's targeting the girlfriend maliciously.\n\nHowever, the way the conversation went might have been a misstep. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the kids without her knowledge could affect her relationship with them. But the author didn't intend to undermine her. He was checking in on the kids. It's important to note that the author isn't keeping secrets; he's ensuring his children are comfortable. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not respected, but that doesn't make the author wrong in wanting to protect his children's feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have handled it differently, maybe involving the girlfriend in the conversation, but the act of talking to the kids about their well-being isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's response seems extreme, but the author isn't the asshole here for prioritizing his children's emotional health. So, the answer is B; he's not in the wrong.\n"
