My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a father) is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend. The father had a conversation with his son to check how the kids are feeling about the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend took it as an attack and left upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The father's intent was to understand his children's feelings, which is a responsible parental action. He wasn't trying to undermine the girlfriend, as he mentioned the conversation included topics about the children's mother as well. The girlfriend, however, felt betrayed and disrespected, interpreting the conversation as a lack of trust.\n\nKey points to consider: Parental responsibility includes monitoring children's well-being and addressing any potential issues. The father didn't involve the girlfriend before talking to the son, which might be a point of contention. However, parents often have the right to discuss family matters with their children without needing permission from a partner, especially when the children's welfare is involved.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If she's concerned about how the children perceive her, she might need to address it with the father. But the father had a valid reason to talk to the son. The fact that the daughter felt undermined is more about her insecurity or communication issues rather than the father's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the father isn't in the wrong because his action was in the best interest of his children. The problem might lie in how the conversation was handled or the girlfriend's interpretation, but the father's intent was appropriate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
