My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son to see how the kids are coping with their mom being away and the girlfriend's role. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is now asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: The author wanted to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to the new family dynamics, which includes the girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset that he talked to the son about her, feeling it's an attack on her. The author argues that he's just trying to be a responsible parent and needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important for parents to understand their children's feelings, especially during times of change. The author's intention was to ensure his son was okay, not to undermine the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt threatened or criticized. But is it the author's fault? Well, maybe the way he approached the conversation could have been better. Maybe he should have considered the girlfriend's feelings more carefully, but his primary responsibility is to his children. Parents do talk to their kids about different aspects of their lives, including new partners, as long as it's age-appropriate and constructive. The author isn't criticizing the girlfriend in front of the kid; he's seeking the child's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is over the top, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. However, given that the conversation was about the child's well-being and not a direct attack, the author's actions seem reasonable. The girlfriend's insecurity might be causing her to take it personally. The author is correct that he should be able to talk to his children without needing permission from a partner. So, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong here. His actions were in the best interest of his child, and the girlfriend's reaction, while intense, doesn't make him the asshole. The answer should be B.\n"
