My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a father with two kids, living with his girlfriend. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, the father had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son feels about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend overheard this and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are the father's right to discuss his children's well-being with them and the girlfriend's reaction. The father's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a normal parental concern. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her consent is disrespectful, especially if it's perceived as a criticism of her role as a caregiver.\n\nIn many cases, parents and their partners need to collaborate in raising children. The father's action could be seen as necessary, but the way he approached it might have caused unnecessary hurt. The girlfriend might feel her authority or relationship with the child is being questioned. However, the father is also justified in wanting to ensure his children are adjusting well, especially with changes in their family dynamics.\n\nThe question is whether the father overstepped. Since he was talking to his son about his feelings and not directly criticizing the girlfriend, but the girlfriend interpreted it as undermining her. The father's intention wasn't to undermine, which is important. But in doing so without considering the girlfriend's perspective, there's a potential for conflict. \n\nIn terms of parental rights, the father has a responsibility to his children, which includes understanding their feelings. However, communication with a partner is also crucial. The father might have handled it differently by discussing the conversation with the girlfriend first. But it's not necessarily wrong because the primary responsibility lies with the child's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether discussing the child's feelings with the child is a legitimate parental action, which it is. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable but perhaps the father's approach could have been more sensitive. However, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his child's emotional health. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
