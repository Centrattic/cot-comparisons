My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, thinking he's undermining her and not having confidence in her. The author's defense is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since the girlfriend was recently unemployed and he's supporting her, maybe affecting their relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intent. He mentioned that he had a wake-up call from comments on his previous post, realizing that the kids might be affected by the girlfriend's behavior. He wanted to check in with his son to make sure everything's okay. That seems like a responsible parent trying to keep his child's best interest in mind. It's not like he was gossiping or trying to turn the kid against the girlfriend. The conversation included topics about the ex-wife and the girlfriend, as he said, so it wasn't just about the girlfriend.\n\nThen, the girlfriend's reaction is pretty intense. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. She feels betrayed and undermined. But why? The father didn't have a problem with her, he just wanted to talk to his son. Maybe the girlfriend feels that discussing her with the child is a breach of trust, even if it's for the child's sake. But is that a valid reaction? If the kids' well-being is at stake, parents have a responsibility to ensure their children are okay, even if it means discussing family members.\n\nAnother angle is the context of their relationship. The author is supporting his girlfriend financially after she lost her job. Maybe there's underlying tension there, and this conversation became a trigger. But the father's action here is about the children, not about the girlfriend herself. Also, the father didn't tell the son negative things; he was just checking in. The son was happy with the current situation, so the father wasn't trying to criticize the girlfriend.\n\nIs there a cultural or social norm here? Typically, parents need to communicate with their children about family dynamics, especially when there are significant others involved. The key point is whether the father's action was appropriate. Since he's the parent, he has the right to talk to his kids about their lives and relationships. The girlfriend might feel hurt, but the father isn't wrong for prioritizing his child's emotional health.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a way to approach this better. Maybe discussing with the girlfriend first could have been better, but the father didn't do that. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, and the father's intent was good. So overall, I think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
