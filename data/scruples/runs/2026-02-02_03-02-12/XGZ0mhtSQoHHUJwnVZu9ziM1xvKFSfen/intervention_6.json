My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a parent, talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined and that the author doesn't trust her. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids about important family matters, including the girlfriend's role, and that he's an adult who shouldn't have to clear every conversation with his partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two sons and a girlfriend living in the household. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author is supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to conflict. Then, the author talked to his oldest son about his feelings regarding his mother, the living arrangement, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend took offense and left the house, claiming betrayal and questioning the relationship.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. Parental responsibility to discuss family matters with children.\n2. The girlfriend's perception of being undermined.\n3. The author's belief that he can talk to his kids without needing permission from his partner.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, talking to his son is part of his duty as a parent. He wanted to ensure the kids are adjusting well, especially with the mother away and the new living situation. The son's positive feedback suggests that the conversation was appropriate and necessary. The author didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend; the discussion included other topics like the mother's absence.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt disrespected. Parents in a relationship might have differing views on how to handle discussions about each other in front of the children. The author didn't consult her before talking to the son, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if his intention was good.\n\nBut considering that parents have an obligation to communicate with their children about family dynamics, especially when there's a new partner involved, the author's action could be justified. The problem might stem from the girlfriend's insecurity or the way the conversation was conducted. However, the author didn't mention discussing the girlfriend in a negative light; he focused on the son's feelings and the situation overall.\n\nIn many relationships, partners might expect some level of consultation, especially when it involves their role as a partner in the family. But the author isn't the parent of the girlfriend, so the expectation of needing her consent before talking to the kids might be unrealistic. The main issue is whether the topic of the girlfriend was necessary. Since the author included other topics like the mother's trip, it wasn't solely about the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. Leaving the house over a conversation with the child about the family situation might indicate her own issues with insecurity or control. The author isn't wrong for wanting to check in with his son about the family's well-being. Parents need to be able to discuss these matters without unnecessary restrictions from the partner, unless there's a specific reason to avoid it (like a history of conflict or the child's needs).\n\nSo, balancing the need to parent effectively versus the partner's feelings, the author acted appropriately. The girlfriend's overreaction doesn't make him at fault here. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
