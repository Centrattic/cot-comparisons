My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author has two sons, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Then, he noticed comments suggesting the kids might sense her discomfort, so he talked to his oldest son about his feelings regarding the situation. The girlfriend found out and got upset, interpreting the conversation as undermining her and leading to her leaving the house.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for discussing his girlfriend with his son. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important for parents to maintain open communication with their children, especially when it involves major life changes like a new partner entering the household. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, which is a responsible action. The conversation wasn't solely about the girlfriend; it also included his son's thoughts about his mother's absence. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt undermined. The key here is whether the author had a right to discuss the girlfriend in front of the son without consulting her. While parents do have the right to talk to their children about family dynamics, the approach might have been sensitive. The girlfriend might have felt that her position as a step-parent wasn't respected, especially if the conversation made her feel like the parent is questioning her role.\n\nIn many cases, when a new partner is involved, especially in a blended family, communication between both adults is crucial. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before talking to the son, which could have been a mistake. Even if the intent was good, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that this conversation might have been perceived as a lack of trust or support. \n\nBut then again, the children's well-being is a parent's priority. The author was concerned about his son's adjustment to the new living situation. It's a balancing act between respecting the girlfriend's feelings and ensuring the children's emotional health. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the action of discussing the girlfriend with the son without her knowledge was a breach of trust. Since the conversation was about the son's perceptions and not a critique of the girlfriend, the author's intent might be on the side of the children's welfare. However, not involving the girlfriend in the discussion could have been a misstep. \n\nGiven that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the conversation was focused on the child's feelings. But there's room for improvement in how such topics are approached. The girlfriend's reaction also highlights the need for better communication between the adults involved. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a lesson here about coordinating with partners when discussing them with children.\n"
