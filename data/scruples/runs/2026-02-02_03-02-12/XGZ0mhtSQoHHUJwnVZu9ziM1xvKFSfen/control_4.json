My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two kids. He had a previous issue where asking his girlfriend to help with the kids led to conflict. Now, he's concerned about the kids' feelings, so he talks to his oldest son about his thoughts on the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend finds out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is now asking if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the father's intention and the girlfriend's reaction. The father says he wanted to check in with his son to ensure he's not hurting him, which sounds like a responsible parent action. Parents often talk to their kids about family dynamics, especially when there are changes like a new partner in the household. The conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mother being away.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend feels that by discussing her with the child, the father is undermining her. The question is whether the father overstepped. As a parent, it's reasonable to discuss family matters with children to ensure their well-being. But how the conversation was framed might matter. If the father was critical of the girlfriend or made the son choose sides, that could be problematic. But the post says the conversation was to gauge the son's feelings, not to undermine. The son was happy and didn't feel hurt.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. That's a big response. But maybe she feels that her position in the family is being questioned, especially if she's in a new role and hasn't established trust yet. The father's action, while well-intentioned, might have made her feel insecure. However, the father should not be in the wrong for trying to understand his child's feelings without malice.\n\nIn adult relationships, some level of trust is necessary. The father isn't sharing private info about the girlfriend but is checking in with his child. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity, but the father isn't wrong for doing his duty as a parent. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
