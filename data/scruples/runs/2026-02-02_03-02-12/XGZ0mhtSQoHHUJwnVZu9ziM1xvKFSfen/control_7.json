My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me go through the details.\n\nThe author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to conflict. Now, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how the son feels about the girlfriend and the situation with his mom. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined. She left the house to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he needed to talk to his son about the children's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling him a 6-year-old, needing to rethink the relationship. But the author is asking if he's in the wrong for having that conversation without her permission.\n\nFirst, as a parent, isn't it reasonable to check in with your child about how they're adjusting to new family dynamics? The son is 14, so it's age-appropriate. The author mentions that the conversation was also about the ex-wife (mother) being away, not just the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about feeling criticized rather than the content of the conversation.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect their relationship. But the author's intention was to ensure the child's feelings were considered, which is a valid concern. Parents do talk to their kids about various family members, including stepparents or partners. The key here is the intent versus the perception. The author didn't intend to undermine her, but the girlfriend felt undermined.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Since he's the parent, it's his role to communicate with his children about their family situation. The girlfriend might need to be more secure, but the author didn't do anything wrong by engaging his son in a discussion about the family. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities rather than the action itself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
