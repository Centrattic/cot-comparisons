My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author talking to their son about their girlfriend and their perception of her. The girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to check in with their son about how he feels, especially since the girlfriend's role in the family is significant. The author mentions that previous comments suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, so they wanted to address that. The son's thoughts were valid, and the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about his mother being away. \n\nThe key points here are whether discussing the girlfriend with the son is a breach of trust or an overstep. Parents often talk to their kids about various family members to understand their feelings. The author is fulfilling their parental duty to keep their children's well-being in check. However, the girlfriend is upset because she perceels the author is questioning her ability to care for the kids. \n\nBut the author argues that they didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend. They are an adult and should be able to talk to their children without prior approval. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive\u2014leaving the house and saying they need to rethink the relationship over a conversation that was meant to be supportive. \n\nIs there a standard here? In many cases, parents have the right to discuss their children's feelings with their kids, even if it involves other adults in their lives. As long as it's done in a respectful and constructive manner, which the author claims it was, then the parent isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's insecurity might be the issue here, not the parent's actions. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything that's against common parenting practices. The problem arises from the girlfriend's interpretation and her overreaction. The author is justified in wanting to ensure their children's emotional well-being, especially after the previous concerns raised by others. The girlfriend's need for control or lack of trust might be the root cause of the conflict here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were being a responsible parent, and the girlfriend's reaction is overblown. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
