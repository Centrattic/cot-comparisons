My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because she feels he undermined her by discussing her with the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two sons, 8 and 14 years old. He had a previous situation where his girlfriend was upset about being asked to pick up the kids, and people on Reddit mentioned that the kids might sense her reluctance. He then talks to his oldest son, the 14-year-old, about his feelings towards the girlfriend and the mom. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling betrayed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether talking to his son about his perceptions of the girlfriend is wrong. Legally, he's not in the wrong because he's a parent and can talk to his children. But emotionally or relationally, is it wrong? The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being and ensure the kids aren't being negatively affected by the situation. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that she feels undermined and not trusted.\n\nIn many cases, parents do have the right to discuss family matters with their children, especially when it affects the child's well-being. However, the context matters. If the discussion was critical of the girlfriend, that might be problematic. But the author says he didn't intend to undermine her and the conversation was also about his ex-wife's absence. \n\nThe key points are: Did he discuss the girlfriend in a way that was negative or critical? The author claims he didn't. The girlfriend feels it was a betrayal. The parent's responsibility is to their children. If the conversation was to assess the child's feelings and well-being, it's justified. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her authority is being questioned. \n\nIn terms of being wrong, if the author didn't go into the conversation with malicious intent and the purpose was to ensure his son's well-being, then he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is her own issue, maybe about boundaries or trust. However, if the conversation included criticism of the girlfriend, that's different. The author says it wasn't, so based on the information, he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting in the best interest of his son and as a parent has the right to discuss family matters with his children.\n"
