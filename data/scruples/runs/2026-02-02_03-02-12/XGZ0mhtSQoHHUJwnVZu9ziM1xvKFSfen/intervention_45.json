My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to an argument. Now, the main issue is that he talked to his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's responsibility. As a parent, he probably wants to check in on his children's feelings, especially regarding their step-parent. The girlfriend might feel that her authority or position in the home is being questioned. But the parent also has a duty to ensure his kids are comfortable and that their living situation is healthy.\n\nThe father's intent was to talk to his son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mother's absence. He didn't mention undermining her, and the conversation was about both. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling him a 6-year-old and leaving. Maybe she feels insecure or that her role isn't respected. But is the father wrong for talking to his child? Parents usually have the right to discuss family matters with their kids, especially when it affects their well-being. The key here is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend specifically. However, since the kids' adjustment to the new family dynamic is important, it's reasonable for the parent to want their input. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to personal insecurities, not the father's wrongdoing. So, I think the father isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
