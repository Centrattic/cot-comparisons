My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he talked to his son about how the kid perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. He has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He's responsible for their well-being. He wanted to check in with the older one to see how he's adjusting to the new living situation, especially since their mom is away and the girlfriend is now part of their lives. The parent's intention was to make sure the child isn't being negatively affected by the situation. That seems like a valid concern. Parents often talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including family dynamics.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She felt that talking to the son about her was undermining her and that he doesn't trust her. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. But is her reaction justified? The parent didn't discuss the girlfriend with the son in a negative way; the post mentions that the son was happy overall. If the parent had a constructive conversation aimed at understanding the child's feelings, then why would that be a problem?\n\nI think the key here is the parent's right to communicate with his children. Just because he's in a relationship with the girlfriend doesn't mean he has to get her approval to talk to his kids. The parent needs to maintain a relationship with his children, which is vital. The girlfriend's insecurity might be the issue here. If she's uncomfortable with him talking to his son about her, maybe there are deeper issues in their relationship, like trust or jealousy. \n\nThe parent did mention that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about his ex-wife's situation. That shows balance. The girlfriend's reaction seems overblown. The parent isn't doing anything unreasonable by checking in with his child. So, he's not the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
