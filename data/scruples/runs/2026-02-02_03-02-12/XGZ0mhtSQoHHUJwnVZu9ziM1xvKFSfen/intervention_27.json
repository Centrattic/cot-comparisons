My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset about that. Then, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how the kid feels regarding his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got very upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to reevaluate their relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he's a parent who needs to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend first. The main question is whether he overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, talking to children about family dynamics is usually necessary to understand their well-being. The author mentions that he was concerned about the kids sensing tension, which previous commenters had pointed out. So initiating the conversation might have been a responsible move to check on their emotional state.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She felt that the conversation undermined her and questioned his confidence in her. The key here is the intent and the context. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend; he was mainly concerned about the kids' feelings towards both the mother and the girlfriend. But the girlfriend might perceive this as a lack of trust or support, especially if she's already feeling stressed about the job loss and new responsibilities.\n\nNow, considering the relationship between the author and his girlfriend, the issue could be about communication and trust. The author didn't inform her beforehand, which might have been a mistake. Even though he had a valid reason, not discussing this with her first could have been seen as dismissive of her feelings. However, the parent's duty to their children's well-being is a significant factor. It's a balance between being a good parent and being a good partner.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the action was a breach of trust or an overstep. While the author's intent was to check on his son's well-being, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt personally attacked. The author might need to consider how to approach such conversations in a way that includes both the children's needs and the partner's feelings, perhaps by discussing it with the girlfriend first or framing the conversation more carefully.\n\nSo, the decision is between A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No, he's not). I think the answer is B because the author's primary responsibility is to his children, and the conversation seems to be in their best interest. However, the way he handled it without considering the girlfriend's feelings could have been better. But in terms of right or wrong, the parent's action isn't inherently wrong, even if the execution could be improved.\n"
