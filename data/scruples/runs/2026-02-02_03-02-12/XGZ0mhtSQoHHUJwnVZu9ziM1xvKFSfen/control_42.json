My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 44-year-old man, lives with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to conflict in the previous post. Now, the author has had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nSo, the main question is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend was wrong. Let me break it down. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, considering previous comments about the kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. He wanted to make sure he wasn't harming his children. The girlfriend, however, feels that this conversation was an attack on her and a lack of confidence in her as a partner.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to communicate with children, especially about significant changes like a parent living with a new partner. The author did this to ensure his son was okay, which seems reasonable. However, he didn't discuss this with his girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but maybe she's overreacting. The author argues that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without prior approval. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a good reason to talk to his son. On the other hand, not discussing this with his girlfriend first could be seen as a breach of trust. But considering the child's well-being is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to insecurity or misunderstanding. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author acted in the child's best interest, but didn't communicate with his girlfriend first. Whether that's wrong depends on the relationship dynamics. However, as a parent, he has the right to talk to his children about their living situation. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, suggesting she might be the one overstepping. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
