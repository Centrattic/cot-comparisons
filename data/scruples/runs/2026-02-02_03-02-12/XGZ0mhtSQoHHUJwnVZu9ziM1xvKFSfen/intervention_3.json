My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author, his girlfriend, and two kids. From the previous post, the girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school, which she didn't like and called him an asshole. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son to check in on his feelings about the living arrangement and the girlfriend, and the girlfriend found out and is upset, thinking he undermined her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the author is a parent trying to ensure his children's well-being. He's concerned after the previous situation where his girlfriend was unhappy with being asked to help. He wanted to talk to his son to assess how the kid is feeling, which is a responsible parenting action. The girlfriend feels that this conversation was an attack on her and that her feelings were not considered. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for having that conversation. On one hand, parents have the right to talk to their children about their well-being and family dynamics. It's important for the kids to feel comfortable and for the parent to be aware of their children's thoughts. The author mentions that the conversation was about both the ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend, so it's not just critical of the girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child without her being involved could be hurtful or indicate a lack of trust. However, the author isn't directly criticizing the girlfriend in front of the child; he's trying to understand the child's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling disrespected rather than the content of the conversation itself. \n\nIn most cases, parents need to communicate openly with their children, especially when there are changes in family structure. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's response is extreme, but the action itself, talking to his son, is justified. Unless there was some prior agreement not to discuss the girlfriend with the children, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The parent is acting in the best interest of his child by seeking the child's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is over the top, but the act of talking to the son isn't wrong. The parent should communicate with his children regardless of the partner's feelings, as long as it's done respectfully.\n"
