My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author lives with his girlfriend, his two boys (8 and 14), and they had some issues before where the girlfriend called him an asshole when he asked her to pick up the kids. Then, after feedback on his previous Reddit post, he decided to talk to his 14-year-old son about how the kid feels regarding his mom being away, living with them, and the girlfriend. The son was happy, but when the girlfriend found out about the conversation, she was upset, feeling undermined and that he didn't trust her. She left to stay with a friend and wants to reconsider the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without permission. He didn't mean to undermine the girlfriend. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, as a parent, you do need to check in with your kids about their well-being. The author's intention was to make sure the kids were okay with the living situation. That seems reasonable. But the problem is that the girlfriend felt her authority or position was undermined. So, maybe the way the conversation was approached made her feel that way. Did the author talk to the son in a way that was critical of the girlfriend? The author says the conversation was about both the mother's trip and the girlfriend. Maybe if he was more neutral, it wouldn't be an issue. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend felt threatened because he's talking to the kids about the new partner. \n\nBut the key point is that parents have a responsibility to their children's emotional well-being. If the author believed that the kids might be affected by the situation, it's his duty to address that. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel that discussing her in front of the kids without her knowledge could be seen as a lack of trust. But in many cases, parents can talk to their kids about their step-parents or partners if it's in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would depend on how the conversation was handled. If he was honest and neutral, then no. But if he was leading the son to criticize the girlfriend, that would be different. From the description, the author just wanted the son's perspective, so he's probably not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
