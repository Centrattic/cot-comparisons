My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father in a new relationship with a girlfriend, and he has two sons. He's been supporting his girlfriend financially after she lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to some conflict. Now, he sat down with his oldest son to discuss how the kids perceive their stepmom (the girlfriend) and how they're adjusting to the changes. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nThe key points here are: the father's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings and well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend took offense, interpreting it as a lack of confidence in her as a partner. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to assess the kids' adjustment. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to ensure the children's emotional well-being. Talking to them about their feelings and the dynamics of the new family situation is part of that. The father didn't share this information with the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the kids' perspectives. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned or that she's not trusted. While it's valid for her to feel hurt, the father's action was about his children's welfare, not undermining her. It's a delicate balance, but the father's primary responsibility is to his children. \n\nHowever, communication between partners is crucial. The father might have considered how to approach the conversation with his son without making the girlfriend feel attacked, perhaps by framing it more as checking the kids' adjustment rather than evaluating the girlfriend. But the intent was not to harm the relationship. \n\nIn terms of fault, the father was acting in the best interest of his children. The girlfriend's reaction, while understandable, might be an overreaction. The father is not wrong for prioritizing his children's emotional health. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
