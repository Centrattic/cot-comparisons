My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset and left, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author's defense is that he needed to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend first, and the conversation was also about his ex-wife's trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two children and a girlfriend. The kids are important, and as a parent, he wants to check in with his son about his feelings. It sounds like he was concerned about the comments from others about the kids sensing the girlfriend's resentment. So he proactively talked to his son, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe problem arose when the girlfriend found out. She felt that the author didn't have confidence in her. But does talking to a child about their parent figure in a relationship necessarily undermine that person? Well, parents and guardians have a responsibility to their children's well-being. If the kids are perceiving things that could affect their emotional state, it's important to address it.\n\nHowever, maybe the way he approached the conversation was an issue. If he was critical of the girlfriend or implied she wasn't doing a good job, that could be problematic. But according to the author, the conversation was balanced and included talking about his son's mother (the author's ex-wife) being away. So maybe he was just checking in generally, not specifically criticizing his girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her perspective is that she feels undermined. But in a relationship where the author is the parent, he has a duty to his children's needs. They don't need to consult their partner on every conversation with their kids, especially when it's about the child's adjustment and feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a lack of communication between the author and his girlfriend. If they had discussed concerns before, perhaps he could have shared his intentions. But the author's main point is that he needed to talk to the kids without prior approval, which is a parent's right. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from insecurity or a lack of trust in the relationship, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action was to ensure his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is a relationship issue that might need addressing, but the author isn't in the wrong for talking to his son.\n"
