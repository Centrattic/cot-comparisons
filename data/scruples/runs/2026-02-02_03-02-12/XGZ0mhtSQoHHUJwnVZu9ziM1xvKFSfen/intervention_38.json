My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author talked to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should be able to talk to their children about important family dynamics, right? Especially when it comes to the children's well-being and their perception of the people around them. The author had a valid concern, considering previous comments about the kids sensing the girlfriend's reluctance. So checking in with the child makes sense.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels betrayed and thinks he lacks confidence in her. The author didn't mention discussing negative things about the girlfriend per se, just how the son views her and the situation. But maybe the way the conversation was approached came off as critical. However, the author's primary goal was to ensure the child's happiness and adjust their approach if needed. \n\nFrom a parental standpoint, it's normal to discuss family members with the kids. The author didn't need permission from the girlfriend to talk to his child. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that the conversation was a critique of her parenting. But the author's intent was to support the child's adjustment, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
