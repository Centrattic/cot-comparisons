My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that he's a dad living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She called him an asshole. Then, after some feedback on Reddit about the kids possibly sensing her not wanting to be there, he talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and that he has no confidence in her, leading her to leave the house to stay with a friend.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole now because he talked to his son about his girlfriend. He argues that he's just trying to check in on his son's well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nSo, the question is whether talking to your child about their perception of your new partner is wrong. From a parenting perspective, it's important to understand how the kids are feeling, especially during transitions like a new family dynamic. However, the girlfriend's reaction is strong, so maybe there's a breach of trust here. But is it the author's fault?\n\nHe didn't consult the girlfriend first, but is that necessary? Parents often discuss family matters with their children, especially regarding their well-being. The girlfriend might feel that her privacy or authority is being questioned. However, the author's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author overstep by discussing the girlfriend with his child without her consent? Or is it a parent's right to check in on their child's feelings, even if it involves discussing the new partner? \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author had a valid reason to talk to his son, and as a parent, ensuring the child's emotional state is important. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. He might need to communicate better with his girlfriend in the future, but the act itself of talking to the child isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
