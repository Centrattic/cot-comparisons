My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has two sons and a girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids and watch them a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, concerned about the kids' feelings (as suggested by Reddit comments), he talked to his oldest son about how the son feels regarding his mom being away and his stepmother. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, accusing him of undermining her and betraying the relationship. The author is now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author initiated a conversation with his son about the son's perception of the author's girlfriend.\n2. The girlfriend felt this conversation was an attack on her and a betrayal.\n3. The author's intention was to check in with his son's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend.\n4. The author is asserting that as a parent, he should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission from his partner.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider:\n\n- Parental Rights: Parents have the right to discuss family matters with their children. It's part of understanding the child's emotional state and ensuring they're adapting well to changes in the family structure, like a new partner.\n\n- Intent vs. Impact: The author's intent was to check in with the son, which is a responsible parent action. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on feeling criticized, but the author didn't go into the conversation to undermine her. The son's well-being is a priority.\n\n- Communication in Relationships: While the author's actions might have been well-intentioned, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. However, the author isn't obligated to seek permission from his girlfriend to talk to his own children. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme given the context. \n\n- The Argument: The girlfriend's anger stems from feeling undermined. However, the author's action was a parent-child conversation, not a discussion between the author and the girlfriend. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his children's emotional health.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that discussing the girlfriend in front of the child could affect the child's perception, but the author's goal was to assess that very thing, indicating he's trying to be proactive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted responsibly as a parent, and while the communication could have been handled more sensitively, the core action of talking to his son isn't wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings of being criticized rather than the author's actual wrongdoing.\n"
