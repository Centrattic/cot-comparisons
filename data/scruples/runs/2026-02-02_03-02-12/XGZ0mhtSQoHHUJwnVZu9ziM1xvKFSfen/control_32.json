My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The author's situation involves his son, his ex-wife (who's away), and his current girlfriend. He's been supporting his girlfriend financially since she lost her job, and she was supposed to pick up the kids a few days a week, which she took issue with. Now, he had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how he perceives the girlfriend, and the girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the author had a conversation with his son about the girlfriend's role in their lives. The son is 14, so a teenager, likely able to handle such a discussion. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which the son seemed okay with. But the girlfriend felt betrayed, believing that the author didn't trust her. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by discussing his girlfriend with his son. On one hand, parents should be able to talk to their children about their family dynamics, especially if the child is old enough to understand. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author didn't involve her in this conversation first, leading to her feeling disrespected.\n\nBut the author's main responsibility is to his children's well-being. He had a legitimate reason to talk to his son to ensure the child wasn't negatively affected by the family changes. The fact that the son was happy is a positive outcome. However, the way the author approached it without the girlfriend's knowledge might have been a misstep. Maybe he should have discussed the conversation with her beforehand, considering they live together and she's involved in the children's lives.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction might be overly sensitive. The author is an adult with two teenagers; he should be able to have necessary conversations with his kids without prior approval from his girlfriend. The real issue might be the girlfriend's insecurity and lack of trust in the relationship. If the author had a prior agreement with her about such discussions, that could affect the answer, but there's no mention of that here.\n\nThe author's argument is that he needed to talk to his kids without needing to clear it with her first. The girlfriend's perception is that it was an undermining act. But in most cases, parents have the right to discuss their children's lives and family relationships with their kids, especially when the kids are teenagers. The key is whether the conversation was respectful and necessary, which it seems to be. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the child's perspective.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings of being undermined rather than the act itself. The author acted in the child's interest, which is the parent's role. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
