My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend feeling undermined after he discussed her with his son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two children, and their mother is away. The girlfriend, who recently lost her job, was asked to take care of the kids, which led to a conflict. The author then talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the girlfriend, which the girlfriend found offensive.\n\nThe key points here are the parental responsibility versus the girlfriend's feelings. Parents generally have the right to discuss family matters with their children, especially regarding their well-being. The author's intention was to understand his son's perspective, which is a reasonable action. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense, feeling that this conversation undermines her authority.\n\nI should consider the balance between a parent's duty to their children and respecting a partner's feelings. The author didn't mention any negative things about the girlfriend during the conversation, just sought his son's opinion. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a feeling of being undervalued. But the author isn't obligated to clear every conversation with his girlfriend about his kids unless there was a prior agreement.\n\nIs the author wrong? If the conversation was neutral and aimed at understanding the child's feelings, then no. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the author's action is within his rights. However, maybe the way he approached it could have been more sensitive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't intend to undermine her and the conversation was necessary for the child's well-being, the answer leans towards B.\n"
