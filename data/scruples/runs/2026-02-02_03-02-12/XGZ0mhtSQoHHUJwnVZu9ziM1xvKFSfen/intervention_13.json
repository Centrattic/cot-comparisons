My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, a man in his 40s, has two sons and a girlfriend he's living with. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her being upset and calling him an asshole. Now, he's talking to his oldest son about how the kid feels about the current situation\u2014his mom being away, living with the girlfriend, and perceptions of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is furious, feeling undermined and lacking trust.\n\nThe author's intention was to check in with his son to make sure the kids aren't being negatively affected by the changes, especially since others had mentioned the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance. He did this without consulting his girlfriend first. The girlfriend sees this as a betrayal and a lack of trust. The author argues that he has a right to talk to his kids without needing permission.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, parents do have the right to talk to their children about their family dynamics. The conversation was about the children's well-being and their feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and threatening to reevaluate the relationship\u2014over a reasonable action. However, maybe the author should have communicated better with his girlfriend beforehand to avoid misunderstandings. But the main issue is that he was checking on his kids, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling mistrusted than the conversation's content. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
