My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The previous situation was that the author (44M) asked his girlfriend (32F) to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, and she was angry. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son to understand the kids' feelings and perceptions, especially since some Reddit commenters suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's action of talking to his son about his girlfriend is wrong. The key points here are the intent behind the conversation and the communication between the author and his girlfriend. The author's intention was to check on his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. He didn't discuss his girlfriend in a negative way but rather as part of a broader conversation about the family dynamics, including the mother's absence and the current living situation.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt the author didn't trust her. In relationships, communication is crucial. Even though the author's intent was good, he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective beforehand. By discussing her in a one-on-one conversation with his son, he might have made her feel that he was evaluating her or questioning her role without her consent. This could be seen as a lack of respect or teamwork, even if unintentional.\n\nBut the author is also a parent, and ensuring his children feel secure and comfortable is important. The question is whether a parent needs to inform their partner before talking to their child about the partner. It's common for parents to discuss family members with their children, but the context matters. If the conversation was neutral and aimed at understanding the child's feelings, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, if it came across as a setup or a critique, that's different. The author claims he didn't undermine her, but the girlfriend perceived it that way. \n\nThe author says they are adults and that he should be able to talk to his children without permission. That makes sense because parents do need autonomy in talking to their kids. But there's a balance. If the conversation involved personal judgments about the girlfriend, it might have been problematic. The author mentions it was as much about the mother's trip as about the girlfriend, so maybe the focus wasn't solely on his girlfriend. Still, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel her role in the family is being questioned. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, even if the author's action is technically okay from a parenting standpoint, it's possible that the way he approached it could have been more considerate. Perhaps he should have discussed with his girlfriend first, especially since the prior issue (asking her to pick up the kids) already caused tension. The girlfriend's feeling of betrayal might stem from the fact that he discussed her with the child without her knowing, which can feel like a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for talking to his son, but he could have handled it differently to avoid hurting his girlfriend. The answer might depend on the specific context and how the conversation was framed. Since the author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a parent's duty, but the method might have been insensitive given the prior conflict. However, the girlfriend's overreaction might also be influenced by her own insecurities or the previous argument. \n\nIn many cases, discussing a partner with the children is necessary and even important for the child's emotional well-being. But if the parent doesn't communicate with the partner about such discussions, it can lead to misunderstandings. The author might not be the asshole here, but there's room for improvement in how he approached the conversation. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but it's not entirely unreasonable if she felt disrespected. However, the author's primary role as a parent to his children could be seen as taking precedence. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the parent has the right to talk to their children about family matters. However, the situation is nuanced. The key is whether the conversation was meant to assess the child's feelings (which is okay) or to criticize the girlfriend (which would be wrong). The author's explanation suggests the former, so he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily the asshole here.\n"
