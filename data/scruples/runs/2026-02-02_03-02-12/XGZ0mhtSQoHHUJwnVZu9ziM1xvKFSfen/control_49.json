My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person talking to Reddit) is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some comments on Reddit made him realize the kids might be affected, he talked to his oldest son about how he feels about his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out, got angry, left, and accused him of undermining her and lacking confidence in her. He's now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author wrong his girlfriend by talking to his son about her? Is it okay for a parent to talk to their child about their step-parent or partner without the partner's consent?\n\nFrom a parental perspective, parents often have the right to discuss family dynamics with their children, especially when it affects the child's well-being. The author was concerned about how his son felt regarding his mother being away and the new living situation. Talking to the child directly is a responsible step to ensure the child's emotional state is okay.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt undermined. The question is whether the conversation was respectful and necessary. The author says the conversation was about both the mother's trip and the girlfriend. If he was just checking in on his son's feelings without criticizing the girlfriend, it's reasonable. The issue might be that the girlfriend perceived it as a lack of trust or support. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before talking to the child, which could be a point of contention. But as the parent, he has a duty to his children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction might be over-the-top, but it's also valid that she felt disrespected. \n\nBalancing both sides: The author did what was necessary for his children, but maybe should have considered his girlfriend's feelings. However, the primary responsibility to the children takes precedence. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author could have handled it more sensitively. Still, the core action of talking to his son isn't wrong.\n"
