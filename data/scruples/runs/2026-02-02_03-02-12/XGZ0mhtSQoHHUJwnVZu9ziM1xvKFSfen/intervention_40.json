My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. His girlfriend lost her job, so he asked her to pick up the kids and watch them, which led to conflict. Then, he sat down with his oldest son to talk about how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined.\n\nThe author's main point is that he needed to talk to his son about his well-being, which included discussing the new living arrangements. He argues that he's a parent and should be able to talk to his kids without permission from his girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, feels betrayed and that her confidence is being undermined.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong by having that conversation. From a parental perspective, it's natural to want to check in with your child about their feelings, especially when there are changes in the family dynamics. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend, but to understand the child's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe she felt insecure or untrusted. However, the key here is that the parent had a valid reason to talk to his son about family changes affecting the child. As an adult, the girlfriend should respect the parent's need to communicate with his children. The author didn't do anything inherently wrong by engaging in a necessary conversation for his child's emotional well-being. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
