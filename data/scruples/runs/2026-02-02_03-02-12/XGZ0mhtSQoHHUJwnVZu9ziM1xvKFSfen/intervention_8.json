My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex. The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Now, after some people suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, the author talked to his oldest son to check in on his feelings. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author's intention was to understand his son's perspective, not to criticize the girlfriend. The author is concerned about his children's well-being and wants to ensure they're not being negatively affected. However, the girlfriend interprets this conversation as a lack of trust and confidence in her. \n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is wrong. On one hand, parents should be able to talk to their children about family matters without interference. The author isn't badmouthing the girlfriend; he's seeking honest feedback from his son, which is a responsible action to ensure the kids' emotional health. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected and undermined. But the author didn't involve the girlfriend in the conversation beforehand because it was about their family dynamics, especially since the kids are his and he's the parent. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's acting in the best interest of his children, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings of being undermined, but if the conversation was open and respectful, the author has the right to discuss things with his kids. The girlfriend might need to work on communication and trust in the relationship. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
