Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. They provided a detailed scenario where the author confronts her boyfriend about the way he treats her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is struggling financially, can't afford to cook much, and relies on her boyfriend for meals. The boyfriend cooks for himself but gives her leftovers, which she ends up eating even though it's not enough. Then he expects her to clean up after him, leading to a confrontation where she expresses her frustration and he calls her names.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he treats her like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. She's upset because he didn't cook for her, gave her leftovers, and then expected her to clean up. She snapped at him, leading to an argument where he insulted her.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual respect and consideration are important. The boyfriend's actions seem self-centered. He's in a better financial position but didn't offer to cook for her, especially when she asked. Giving her leftovers instead of making a proper meal for her could be seen as neglectful. Then, expecting her to do the dishes after that is unfair. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. She's not in a position to cook much, and he's not supporting her in a way that a partner should. His reaction of calling her names is also inappropriate.\n\nThe author's response was to express her feelings, which is a healthy way to communicate. She wasn't wrong to feel taken advantage of. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing her, restraining her, and being verbally abusive\u2014is wrong. Even if the author's tone was harsh, her underlying concerns are valid. The key here is the pattern of behavior, not just the single incident. The boyfriend's actions suggest a lack of respect and consideration, which places the blame more on him.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her reaction was a response to being treated unfairly. The answer should be B.\n"
