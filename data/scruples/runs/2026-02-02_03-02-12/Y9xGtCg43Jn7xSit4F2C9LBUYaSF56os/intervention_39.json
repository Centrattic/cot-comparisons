Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong in her situation with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is in a 5-year relationship. She's struggling financially, can't afford meat often, and isn't a good cook. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew for himself. She asks for a portion, he says no. Later, he offers her the leftovers after eating most of it. She eats it, then he demands she clean the dishes. She resists, leading to a confrontation where she expresses frustration about being treated unfairly, calling him out for giving her leftovers as a \"kind\" act when it's not really generous. He yells at her, calling her ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other. The boyfriend is in a position where he can afford to cook more, yet he prioritizes his own meal without considering her needs. Even if he had a reason to say no, offering leftovers after eating is not the same as cooking for her. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial constraints and the emotional labor of dealing with this repeatedly.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014pushing her, restraining, yelling\u2014are abusive behaviors. The author's reaction is a response to this mistreatment. She's standing up for herself after being treated poorly, which is a valid response. The situation shows a pattern of him not respecting her needs and treating her as if she's a servant rather than a partner.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky, but the boyfriend's lack of support and his aggressive response are problematic. The author isn't wrong for speaking up about being treated unfairly. It's important to address toxic behavior in relationships, and the author is recognizing that she shouldn't be treated like a \"dog\" or a roommate without mutual respect.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
