Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend cooking a stew, giving her leftovers, and then pressuring her to clean up.\n\nFirst, the author mentions her financial struggles, being unable to afford meat regularly. She's not a good cook, so relying on her boyfriend's cooking makes sense. When she asked for a portion, he refused. Later, after he ate most of it, he offered the leftovers. She accepted because she was hungry. Then he made her clean the dishes despite her pointing out he was the one who cooked, which led to an argument.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem to be the main issue here. He had the means to cook for both, but only made for himself. Then, after giving her minimal leftovers, he expected her to do the dishes and got aggressive. The author's outburst was in response to his controlling behavior. She felt disrespected, treated like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to cook for her, giving leftovers, then demanding she clean up and being abusive\u2014seems to be the core problem. The author's reaction was a response to his mistreatment. She's not wrong for standing up for herself in that situation. So the answer is B, No.\n"
