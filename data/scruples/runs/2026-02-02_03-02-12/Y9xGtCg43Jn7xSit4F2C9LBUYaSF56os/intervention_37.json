Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cooked meat stew for himself, gave his girlfriend the leftovers, and then made her clean up. The girlfriend got upset and called him out for treating her like a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend can't afford meat often, so when he cooks it, he gives her leftovers. She's already struggling financially. The boyfriend expects her to do the dishes even though he was the one who cooked. That seems one-sided. The girlfriend's reaction was anger at being treated unkindly, especially after not getting enough food. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, giving minimal leftovers, then expecting her to clean up. The girlfriend's response was to confront him about being ungrateful, which led to a confrontation. \n\nIn relationships, fairness and mutual respect matter. The boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of consideration. The girlfriend's outburst was a reaction to being treated poorly and not being supported. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself. The boyfriend's actions are more problematic\u2014using physical restraint and calling her names. The author is justified in feeling wronged. So the answer is B.\n"
