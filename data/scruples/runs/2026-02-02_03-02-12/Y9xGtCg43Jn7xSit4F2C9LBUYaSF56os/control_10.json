Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the boyfriend cooks for himself and gives leftovers to the author, who is in a tough financial situation. The author is frustrated because the boyfriend isn't cooking for both of them, especially since she can't afford proper meals.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions: he cooks for himself, gives her leftovers, which she sees as insufficient. He then expects her to clean up after eating, even though he was the one cooking. The author then confronts him, leading to a physical altercation where he pushes her. She snaps back, and he calls her an ungrateful b*tch. \n\nThe key points here are the financial disparity\u2014she's struggling, he's not. She's asking for a basic level of support, like cooking for both, but he's only giving leftovers. The expectation that she should clean up despite him cooking. The physical aggression is a major red flag. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault: the boyfriend's behavior is abusive. He's physically aggressive, doesn't support her financial situation, and treats her poorly. The author, while frustrated, is standing up for herself. She's not the one being violent, just expressing her frustration. Her statement about not being his dog is valid because they're in a 5-year relationship, which should involve mutual respect and support, not one-sided care. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are inexcusable, especially the physical push. The author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances. The fact that he's being unkind and not supporting her financial struggles makes him the one at fault.\n"
