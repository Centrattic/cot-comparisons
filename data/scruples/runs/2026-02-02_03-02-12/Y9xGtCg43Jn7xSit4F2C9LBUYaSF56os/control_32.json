Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked for himself but gave her leftovers, then got angry when she didn't clean up and called her names. The author snapped back, feeling treated like a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is struggling financially, can't afford meat, and isn't good at cooking. She asked her boyfriend to cook a portion for her when he was making stew. He refused, then gave her the leftovers. She ate them because she was hungry. Later, he made her clean the dishes, pushed her, called her names. She stood up for herself, which caused conflict.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author was wrong to confront him. Let's consider the boyfriend's actions first. He cooked for himself but not for her, even though she asked. Then, instead of making a full meal for both, he gave her scraps. Then he pushed her and used aggressive language. That seems abusive. His behavior is clearly problematic. \n\nThe author's response was to defend herself after being mistreated. She pointed out the unfairness of his actions, which is a normal reaction when someone is being treated disrespectfully. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to cook for her, giving her leftovers, then physical aggression\u2014are the real issues here. \n\nFinancial struggles shouldn't excuse his behavior. Even if he wasn't in financial trouble, it's his responsibility to support his partner or at least be considerate. The fact that he's been in a 5-year relationship suggests he should be more understanding. The author's frustration is valid. She's not being ungrateful for the leftovers; she's pointing out that true kindness would have been cooking for both. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her reaction was justified given the circumstances. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
