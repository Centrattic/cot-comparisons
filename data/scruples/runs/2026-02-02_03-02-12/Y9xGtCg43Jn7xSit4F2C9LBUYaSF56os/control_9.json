Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend who's struggling financially and can't cook well, and her boyfriend who's in a better financial situation. The main issue is that the boyfriend cooked a stew for himself, gave her leftovers, and then expected her to clean up after him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot financially. She can only afford basic groceries and can't cook much. She asked him to make a portion for her when he was cooking, but he refused. Then, he gave her the leftovers, which were minimal. She ate those, but later he made her clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She got angry, told him off, and he called her an ungrateful bitch.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. When she asked for a portion, maybe he had a reason not to cook for her. But if he had enough ingredients, maybe he was being selfish. However, the author didn't mention he refused for a valid reason. Also, giving her the leftovers after eating most of it might not be generous. She's his girlfriend of five years, so expecting a bit more consideration might be reasonable.\n\nThen, when he physically pushed her and restrained her, that's a red flag. Any physical aggression is a big no-no. The author defended herself by snapping back, which is understandable given the stress and her situation. He called her names, which is hurtful. \n\nIn terms of chores, since he cooked, he should have cleaned up. He made her do it even though it was his cooking. That's unfair. She was polite at first, saying he wasn't being kind, but he responded violently. \n\nFinancial hardship can be a stress factor, but the boyfriend's actions of physical aggression and expecting her to clean up after cooking for himself are problematic. The author's outburst was in response to being pushed and feeling disrespected. \n\nSo, looking at both sides: the boyfriend's actions (physical aggression, not sharing the meal, expecting her to clean up) are more in the wrong. The author had valid reasons to feel frustrated and was in a vulnerable position. Her reaction, while maybe harsh, was a response to his behavior. She's not the one at fault here. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
