Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of being treated like a dog. The key points here are about unfair treatment in a relationship, especially regarding chores and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're struggling financially, can't afford meat often, and their boyfriend cooks a stew but only for himself. When she asks for a portion, he says no, but later offers leftovers. She eats what's left, which isn't much. Then, after eating, he demands she clean the dishes, even though she already did. He gets angry, pushes her, and calls her names. She snaps back, which leads to an argument.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and fairness are crucial. The boyfriend's actions seem to be about control and imbalance. He's in a better financial position, yet he's not contributing equally to shared responsibilities. Making her eat leftovers and then expecting her to clean up, especially after a conflict, is unfair. The author's frustration is valid because she's being treated as if she's obligated to serve him without reciprocation. Her outburst is a reaction to being disrespected and mistreated over time, not just that one incident. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014physical pushing and derogatory language\u2014is clearly wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. Answer B.\n"
