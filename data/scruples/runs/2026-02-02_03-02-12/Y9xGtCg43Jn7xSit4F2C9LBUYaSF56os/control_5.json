Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend dealing with financial issues and household responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a woman dealing with medical expenses and can't afford much food. She's not a good cook and hates cooking. Her boyfriend, who's financially stable, cooks a meat stew. She asks him to make a portion for her, but he refuses. Later, he gives her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats them because she's hungry. Then, he tells her to clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She resists, gets angry, tells him off, and he calls her names. She's questioning if she was wrong to snap.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend has the means to cook for both but didn't. He gave her what's left after he ate, which isn't enough. The author was hungry and asked for a portion. The boyfriend's refusal might stem from selfishness or lack of consideration. When he tells her to clean up, that's an issue because he's the one who cooked. The forceful behavior (pushing, restraining) is a red flag for potential abuse, but the user is focusing on whether the author was in the wrong for her reaction.\n\nThe key factors are: the boyfriend's refusal to share his meal, giving her minimal leftovers, making her clean up despite not cooking, and his physical aggression. The author's response was to confront him about his behavior, which seems justified given the context. Her financial situation and his refusal to help equally contribute to the tension. The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's frustration is understandable. The question is whether her anger was warranted. Since he was being inconsiderate and controlling, her reaction might not be the problem. The AITA format usually looks at who acted unreasonably. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, so the author's outburst might be a reaction to his poor treatment. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
