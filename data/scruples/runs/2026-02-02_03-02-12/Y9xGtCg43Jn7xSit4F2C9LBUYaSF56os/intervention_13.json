Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself, gave the leftovers to the author, and then made her clean up. The author got angry because he didn't cook for her properly and treated her like a dog. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a tough financial situation, can't afford meat often, and relies on her boyfriend for meals. The boyfriend cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, but then forced her to clean up. The author then snapped, telling him he didn't cook for her and that she's not his dog. The boyfriend called her an ungrateful bitch.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about fairness in their relationship. The boyfriend is in a better financial position but didn't cook for both. Instead, he gave her leftovers, which the author found insufficient. Then, he made her clean up, which she felt was unfair since he cooked. The author's outburst was in response to his controlling behavior.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions: he had the means to buy better ingredients but didn't cook for her properly. Giving leftovers isn't a generous act if it's just a minimal amount. Then, using physical force to make her clean up crosses a line. Physical restraint and anger are not acceptable in a healthy relationship. The author's frustration is justified given her situation and his behavior.\n\nThe author's response was to stand up for herself, which is a valid reaction to being treated disrespectfully. She's pointing out the imbalance in their relationship where she's treated like a servant. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and threatening not to cook again shows he's in the wrong by being controlling and unkind.\n\nFinancial struggles can strain relationships, but the boyfriend's actions here seem more about control than inability. He could have cooked for her if he wanted to be kind, but instead, he gave leftovers and forced her to clean. The author's outburst is a reaction to being mistreated, so she's not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem, not the author's response.\n"
