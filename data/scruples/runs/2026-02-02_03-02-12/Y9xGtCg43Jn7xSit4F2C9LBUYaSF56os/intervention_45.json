Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author is in a financial struggle, can't afford to cook much, and relies on their boyfriend for meals. The boyfriend cooked a stew for himself and gave the leftovers to the author, who was hungry all day. Then, the boyfriend asked her to clean the dishes, leading to an argument where the author expresses frustration and the boyfriend responds angrily.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and respect in the relationship. The author is feeling used, as she's being treated like she has to do chores without reciprocation. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave leftovers, but the author feels it's not enough and that she's being taken advantage of. The boyfriend's reaction of pushing her and calling her names is clearly abusive behavior, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author's outburst is a reaction to being mistreated and feeling unappreciated. She's standing up for herself, which is understandable given the circumstances. The boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking for himself, giving minimal leftovers, expecting her to clean, and using physical force\u2014show a pattern of disrespect and control. The author's frustration stems from being in a relationship where her needs aren't met, especially given her financial constraints.\n\nFinancial dependence can make someone feel more vulnerable, but the boyfriend's behavior crosses a line into emotional and physical abuse. The author isn't wrong for expressing her feelings, especially after being pushed and cornered. Standing up for oneself in the face of abuse is justified. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here, not the author's reaction to them.\n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's abusive behavior and the author's valid feelings of being mistreated, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
