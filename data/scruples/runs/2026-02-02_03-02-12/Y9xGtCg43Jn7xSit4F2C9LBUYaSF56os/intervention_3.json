Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's dealing with financial issues, can't afford to cook much, and tonight asked her boyfriend to make her a portion of the stew he was cooking for himself. He said no, but later offered the leftovers after he was done eating. She ate the leftovers, then when she tried to put the dish in the sink, he pushed her and made her clean the dishes. She snapped, told him off, and he called her an ungrateful b*tch.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about expectations in a relationship. The author is not in a position to cook much due to financial constraints and medical expenses. She's not in a financial trouble, he is. She asked for a portion of his cooking, which he refused. Then he gave her leftovers but not enough. Then he physically pushed her and made her clean up, which is abusive behavior. The author's response was to confront him, which led to the argument.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From my perspective, the boyfriend's actions are problematic. He offered her leftovers after eating, which wasn't generous, and then physically pushed her when she tried to clean up. That's domestic abuse right there. The author's frustration is understandable because he's treating her like a servant or a dog, not a partner. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself when he's being abusive. Even though there might be some communication issues, the physical restraint and yelling are clear signs of him being in the wrong. The author's outburst was a reaction to his inappropriate behavior. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
