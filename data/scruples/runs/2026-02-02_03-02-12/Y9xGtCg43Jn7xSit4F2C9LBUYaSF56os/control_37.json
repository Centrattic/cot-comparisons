Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend and boyfriend. The girl is struggling financially, can't cook well, and asked her boyfriend to cook a portion for her. He initially said no but later gave her leftovers. Then he made her clean up, she got angry, and called him out. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a 5-year relationship. She's in a tough financial situation, buying only basic groceries. She can't cook, so she asked him to cook for her. He refused, then gave her leftovers. She ate it, but he made her do the dishes. She pushed back, leading to an argument where she called him out on being unkind. He called her names and said he wouldn't cook for her again.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From her perspective, she's in a difficult financial situation, can't cook, and relied on her partner to share a meal. When he gave her leftovers, she ate it, but his behavior (pushing her to clean up) was aggressive. She felt disrespected and called him out, which led to his anger. \n\nOn the other hand, he cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, and expected her to clean up. He might think that since he provided food, he's entitled to her doing the dishes. However, his reaction of pushing her and using force is abusive. The author's response was to express frustration, which is understandable given the situation.\n\nFinancial dependency can create power imbalances. She's in a position where she can't cook for herself, so relying on him is necessary. His refusal to cook for her, then giving leftovers, and then expecting her to clean up without a proper meal shows a lack of consideration. The physical aggression he used is a red flag, indicating possible abuse. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling treated unfairly, like a servant or dog. Her outburst was a reaction to his controlling behavior. Even though she could have handled it differently, his actions (pushing, restraining) are more problematic. The fact that he called her names and threatened not to cook again shows he's unwilling to compromise or be kind.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are key. His actions don't show support; instead, they impose his will on her. The author is standing up for herself against mistreatment, which is not the wrong thing to do. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
