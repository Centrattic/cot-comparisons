Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a woman in a 5-year relationship. She's struggling financially, can't cook well, and only has basic groceries. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks for a portion, but he refuses. Later, he offers her leftovers, which are barely enough. She eats them, then he makes her clean up, even though she had already done dishes earlier. She snaps back, tells him he wasn't kind, and they argue.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in the relationship. The author is in a tough spot financially and can't cook, so relying on her boyfriend for meals isn't unreasonable. But he's cooking for himself and not offering to share. Even the leftovers are minimal. Then he expects her to clean up after him, which she had already done earlier. His behavior seems controlling and ungenerous.\n\nThe author's response is an outburst where she accuses him of treating her poorly. She feels like she's being treated like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. The boyfriend's reaction is to call her ungrateful, which seems harsh given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about mutual respect and support in a relationship. Partners should consider each other's needs. The boyfriend not offering to cook a proper meal for her, despite knowing her situation, is selfish. Also, the physical pushing is a form of abuse, which is definitely wrong. The author's frustration leading to her outburst is understandable given the abuse and lack of support.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is clearly in the wrong for not being supportive and for the physical aggression. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to his poor behavior. She's not wrong for standing up for herself after being treated poorly. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
