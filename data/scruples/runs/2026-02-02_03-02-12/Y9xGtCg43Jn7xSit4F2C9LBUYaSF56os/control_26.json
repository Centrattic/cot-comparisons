Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 5-year relationship. She mentions she's not a good cook, hates cooking, and is struggling financially because of medical expenses. She can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta, with meat being a rare luxury. \n\nHer boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooked a meaty stew for himself. She asked if she could have some, but he said no. Later, he gave her the leftovers, which were minimal. Then, he made her clean the dishes after she ate. She told him he wasn't being kind but selfish, leading to a confrontation where he pushed her and called her names.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial disparity, the boyfriend's initial refusal to share his meal, giving her leftovers, then expecting her to clean up, and the physical aggression. The author's frustration is about being treated unfairly, not getting proper meals, and the emotional labor she's shouldering. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem controlling and disrespectful. He used his financial status to not share the meal he prepared, then expected her to do chores. The physical push adds a layer of abuse. The author's outburst was in response to being mistreated. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are crucial. It's clear the boyfriend isn't considering her needs and is acting entitled. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. She's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, especially when her basic needs aren't met and she's being physically abused. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
