Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself and gave the leftovers to his girlfriend, who was studying and hadn't eaten much. The girlfriend then got upset when he made her clean up and told him off, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is in a difficult financial situation, can't cook well, and can't afford meat often. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers. She asked to have a portion when he started cooking, but he refused. Then after eating, he told her to clean the dishes she didn't use, which she had already cleaned earlier. She snapped at him, leading to the argument.\n\nFrom the description, the boyfriend's actions seem dismissive and possibly disrespectful. He gave her leftovers instead of cooking for both, which the girlfriend felt was unfair. When she asked for a portion, he said no, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Then, after she ate the leftovers, he made her clean up, which she had already done. The physical pushing adds another layer of abuse, which is a serious issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was to confront him about his behavior. She called out his lack of kindness and the unfair treatment. While her approach might have been confrontational, the underlying issue is about respect and fairness in their relationship. The boyfriend's actions seem to contribute to the problem by not considering her needs and treating her more like a servant than a partner.\n\nFinancial struggles can add stress, but the boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to share his meal, making her clean up, and using physical force\u2014crosses into abusive territory. The girlfriend's frustration is understandable given the circumstances. She's in a vulnerable position financially and is being treated poorly.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's actions are definitely in the wrong here. The girlfriend was defending herself against disrespectful treatment. While her response might have been harsh, it's a reaction to ongoing issues. The key point is the boyfriend's behavior, not just the immediate incident. The physical push is a red flag for abuse, which makes the situation more about his wrongdoing than hers.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions were the main issue, and the girlfriend was standing up for herself against mistreatment.\n"
