Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a girlfriend who's been in a 5-year relationship. She's not good at cooking and is financially struggling, so she can only afford basic groceries. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, made a stew and didn't offer her a portion when she asked. Later, he gave her the leftovers, which were barely enough. Then he made her clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She snapped, told him he wasn't being kind, and he called her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each person's perspective. The author is in a tough spot financially and has no interest in cooking. She's relying on her boyfriend to share the cooking duties, which is understandable in a long-term relationship. However, when she asked for a portion, he refused, even though he had enough ingredients. That seems selfish, especially since she couldn't afford to cook for herself. Then he gave her the leftovers, which were minimal, and then expected her to clean up. That's adding insult to injury.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself and then expecting her to clean up, even though he was the one who cooked. In a healthy relationship, both partners usually share responsibilities. If he cooked, it's reasonable to expect he'd clean up, or at least have a discussion about it. Instead, he got angry and physically pushed her, which is a red flag. Physical restraint and yelling are abusive behaviors, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author's response was to snap at him, pointing out the lack of kindness. Considering the boyfriend's behavior and the context of their financial situation, her frustration seems justified. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially when he was being unkind and inconsiderate. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and threatening not to cook again is also problematic. \n\nFinancial disparities can create stress in a relationship, but it's the responsibility of both partners to support each other. The boyfriend's refusal to share the meal and then making her do the dishes is unfair. The author's outburst was a reaction to being treated poorly, which is a natural response when someone feels disrespected or taken advantage of. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were more harmful\u2014physical push, yelling, and not being considerate of her situation. The author had a valid reason to express her frustration. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
