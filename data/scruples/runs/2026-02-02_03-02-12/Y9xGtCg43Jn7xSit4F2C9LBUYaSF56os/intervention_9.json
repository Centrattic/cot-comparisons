Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend dealing with cooking responsibilities and their dynamic.\n\nFirst, the author mentions her financial struggles, being poor due to medical expenses, and only being able to afford basic groceries. She's a terrible cook and doesn't like cooking. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks for a portion, he says no. Later, he offers her leftovers, which are minimal. She eats them because she's hungry. Then he makes her clean the dishes, leading to a confrontation where she snaps and tells him he wasn't kind. He yells at her and calls her names.\n\nThe author feels she's not wrong, but wants to know if the answer is A or B.\n\nSo, breaking it down: The boyfriend is in a better financial position and chooses to cook only for himself. He denies making a portion for her even though he had enough ingredients. Then gives her leftovers but expects her to clean up. The author's frustration is about being treated like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. Her snapping was in response to his controlling and unkind behavior.\n\nKey points: The boyfriend's actions seem self-centered. He uses his cooking as a way to guilt-trip her into doing chores. The author is in a vulnerable financial situation and can't cook. Her outburst was a reaction to being mistreated. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other without expecting one-sided service. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning here\u2014pushing her, restraining, yelling. The author's response, while perhaps harsh in words, is a justified reaction to being disrespected. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
