Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a girlfriend who's struggling financially and can't cook due to her lack of cooking skills and limited resources. She asked her boyfriend to cook a portion for her when he made a stew, but he refused. Later, he gave her leftovers, which weren't enough, and then pushed her to clean the dishes. She snapped, calling him out, and he responded angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a financially tough spot and can't afford meat, so her options are limited. She's not the one cooking, which might be due to her own limitations. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks for himself but gives her leftovers. However, the author feels that this isn't sufficient and that he's being unfair by not helping more. When she confronts him, he reacts with anger and physical aggression (pushing her), which is a red flag. \n\nNow, the key points: The boyfriend's refusal to cook for her even though he had the means could be seen as selfish or not considering her needs. The fact that he gave leftovers might be his way of helping, but the author feels it's inadequate. However, the boyfriend's response\u2014pushing her and calling her a \"b*tch\"\u2014is clearly abusive behavior. The author's frustration is understandable given her situation. She's in a long-term relationship (5 years) and expects more support and mutual respect. \n\nThe author's reaction was to express her frustration and point out the lack of kindness, which is a valid response to being treated poorly. The boyfriend's actions\u2014both his initial refusal to cook for her and the subsequent aggression\u2014are problematic. Physical restraint, even if not violent in the sense of hitting, is a form of abuse and should be taken seriously. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings. She's in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally, and her reaction is a response to being mistreated. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The author's outburst is a result of pent-up frustration and the immediate incident. \n\nHowever, one might argue that she could have approached the situation differently, like discussing it calmly instead of snapping. But given the context of ongoing issues and the immediate stress of hunger, her reaction is understandable. Also, the boyfriend's behavior crosses into abusive territory, which shifts the blame towards him. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the primary problem here.\n"
