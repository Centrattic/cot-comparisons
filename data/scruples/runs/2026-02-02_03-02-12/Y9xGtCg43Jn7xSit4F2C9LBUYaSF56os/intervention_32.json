Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend cooking a stew for himself and giving her leftovers after she asked for a portion. The author then snaps when he demands she clean the dishes, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is struggling financially and can't cook much herself. The boyfriend cooks for himself and gives her leftovers, which she views as ungenerous. She's frustrated that he expects her to do the dishes for something he didn't actually cook for her. The boyfriend's actions\u2014giving her leftovers, expecting her to clean up, and then calling her names\u2014seem controlling and disrespectful. \n\nThe author's reaction is justified because she's in a tough financial situation and is being treated unfairly. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic: he's not supportive, gives her minimal food, and then expects her to clean up. His use of physical force when restraining her is a red flag. The author's outburst is a reaction to years of mistreatment, not just this one incident. \n\nConsidering healthy relationships, partners should support each other, not take advantage. The boyfriend's actions here show a lack of consideration and respect. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. The answer should be B (No).\n"
