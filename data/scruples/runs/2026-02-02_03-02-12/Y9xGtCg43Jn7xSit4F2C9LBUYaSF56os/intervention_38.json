Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend cooking a meat stew for himself, giving her a small portion, and then getting angry when she doesn't clean up. The author feels disrespected and confronts him.\n\nFirst, the financial context is important. The author is struggling with medical expenses and can only afford basic groceries. Cooking is a challenge because of this. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks for himself and gives her leftovers. But the author didn't ask to share until after he started eating, and then he gave her barely enough. That seems like a lack of consideration.\n\nWhen she asks for a portion, he says no without a reason, which is confusing because there was enough for two. Then, after eating, he gives her the leftovers, but she ends up eating just a bit. Then he demands she clean the dishes, which she didn't do because he was the one who cooked. He uses force, pushing and restraining her, which is a red flag for abuse. \n\nThe author's outburst is about feeling treated unkindly. She points out that he didn't actually cook for her, just gave her leftovers. Her snapping is a reaction to being physically restrained and treated disrespectfully. His response of calling her an ungrateful b*tch is clearly hostile.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, mutual respect and consideration are key. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share a meal, giving leftovers, and using physical force\u2014cross boundaries. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. She's in a vulnerable financial position and the boyfriend isn't supporting her adequately. His behavior is controlling and disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions are clearly problematic. The author's response, while maybe not the best way to handle it, is a reaction to being mistreated. She's standing up for herself after being pushed and disrespected. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
