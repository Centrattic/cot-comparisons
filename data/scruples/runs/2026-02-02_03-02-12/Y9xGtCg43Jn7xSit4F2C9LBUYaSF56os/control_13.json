Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author and her boyfriend. She's in financial trouble, can't cook well, and asked to join his meal. He initially said no, then gave her leftovers. She ate them because she was hungry, and he later made her clean up, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, looking at the boyfriend's actions. He had the means to cook for both, but chose not to. When she asked, he refused, possibly because he's not generous. Then, after eating, he gave her leftovers, which were minimal. That's not a generous act; it's more like giving scraps. The author's frustration is understandable because she wasn't treated with kindness or respect. \n\nWhen he cornered her to clean the dishes, he was being controlling. He had just given her the dishes to clean, even though it was his responsibility. His reaction of pushing and restraining her is abusive, regardless of the situation. The author's outburst was a response to his abusive behavior and lack of consideration.\n\nThe author's anger stems from being treated poorly and not being respected as a partner, not as a roommate or a dog. Her statement that she's not his dog is a reaction to his domineering attitude. She's pointing out the inequality in their relationship regarding responsibilities and kindness.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to cook for her, giving leftovers, then demanding she clean up, and using physical force\u2014are all problematic. The author's response, while perhaps heated, is a justified reaction to his behavior. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself against his mistreatment.\n"
