Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. The situation involves her financial struggles and the boyfriend cooking a stew but only for himself, then giving her leftovers. He also pushed her when she tried to clean up.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot financially. She can't afford meat often and relies on her boyfriend's cooking when she can't make meals. The boyfriend cooked a stew for himself, then gave her the leftovers, which she found insufficient. When she tried to clean up, he physically pushed her, which is a red flag. The author's outburst was in response to his behavior and the unfair treatment.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the boyfriend's actions seem manipulative. He cooked for himself but didn't make a meal for her, giving her scraps. Then he used that as an excuse to push her, which is abusive. The author's frustration is justified given his actions and her circumstances. She's in a 5-year relationship, so expecting mutual support makes sense. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her an ungrateful bitch\u2014shows a lack of empathy and accountability.\n\nPhysical restraint and pushing are forms of abuse, so the boyfriend's actions are definitely wrong. The author's response, while maybe harsh, is a reaction to being treated poorly and physically mistreated. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially after being in a relationship that's allowed such behavior. The boyfriend's entitlement to her gratitude without reciprocating is the real issue here.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are abusive and exploitative, and her reaction is a valid response to his mistreatment.\n"
