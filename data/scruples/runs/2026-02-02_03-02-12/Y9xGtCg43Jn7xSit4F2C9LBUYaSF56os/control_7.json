Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person is a woman in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's struggling financially because of medical expenses, so she can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta. She's not a good cook and hates cooking, so when her boyfriend cooks a stew for himself, she asks for a portion. He says no, but later offers the leftovers once he's full, which ends up being very little. She eats it, then he demands she clean the dishes, leading to a confrontation where she feels disrespected and lashes out, causing an argument.\n\nFirst, the main points here are about financial hardship, unequal contributions in the relationship, and communication issues. The boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, so he can afford to buy meat more regularly. The woman is in a tough spot, and her request seems reasonable. He cooked a meal, but only for himself, then gave her leftovers. She's not a servant, so asking her to clean up after his meal is part of the problem. The fact that he pushed her and restrained her is a red flag\u2014physical aggression is never okay, regardless of the situation. His reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" is also abusive language.\n\nThe woman's outburst is a result of her frustration and feeling undervalued. She points out that he didn't cook for her, just gave her leftovers, so it's not an act of kindness. She's expressing her feelings, which is valid. However, the way she responded could have been handled more calmly, but given the context of his behavior, her reaction isn't unreasonable. The key issues here are his controlling behavior, the physical aggression, and the imbalance in their relationship. The woman isn't in the wrong for speaking up about being treated poorly. The boyfriend's actions are the main problem here.\n"
