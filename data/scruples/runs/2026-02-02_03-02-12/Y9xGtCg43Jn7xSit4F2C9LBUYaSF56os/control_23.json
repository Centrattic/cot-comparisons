Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself, gave the leftovers to the author, and then forced her to clean up. The author then confronts him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is in a financial situation where she can't afford to cook much, relying on basics. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks for himself and gives her leftovers. She feels he's being unkind and treating her poorly, which leads to her snapping and calling him out.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, giving her leftovers, expecting her to clean up, and then getting angry when she resists. He physically restrained her, which is a red flag. The author's response was to voice her frustration, which seems justified given the context.\n\nThe author's main argument is that she's being treated unfairly, like a dog. She's not asking for much\u2014just equal consideration. The boyfriend's behavior includes physical aggression (pushing, restraining) and emotional abuse (calling her names). The author's outburst was in response to being treated poorly, not initiating the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions are definitely problematic. The physical aggression is a major issue. The author's response, while perhaps harsh in words, is a reaction to mistreatment. She's standing up for herself in a situation where she's been disrespected and physically harmed. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's actions were abusive and disrespectful, and the author is justified in defending herself against that treatment. The key points are the physical aggression and the imbalance in the relationship's dynamic.\n"
