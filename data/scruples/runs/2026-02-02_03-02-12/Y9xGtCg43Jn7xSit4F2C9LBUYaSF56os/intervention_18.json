Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cooked for himself, gave the author leftovers, and then got angry when she didn't clean up. The author is frustrated because she thinks he's treating her like a dog, not a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a financial situation where she can't afford to cook much. The boyfriend, who isn't struggling financially, cooks a meal for himself and offers her the leftovers. She accepts, but later when he demands she clean up, she snaps. The boyfriend reacts angrily, calling her names and saying he won't cook for her again.\n\nThe author's main issue is that she feels unappreciated and treated unfairly. She's not asking for much\u2014just to be treated as a partner rather than a servant. The boyfriend's actions seem to be about control and lack of empathy. He didn't cook for both of them, gave her minimal leftovers, and then expected her to do the dishes. That's not equitable. \n\nThe author's response was to stand up for herself, which is reasonable. She's not in the wrong for asserting her boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing her, restraining, name-calling\u2014is abusive. Even if the author overreacted a bit, the context of his actions makes her justified in feeling wronged. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
