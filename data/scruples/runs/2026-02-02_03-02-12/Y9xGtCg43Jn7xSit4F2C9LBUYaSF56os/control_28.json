Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself, gave the leftovers to the author, and then made her clean up. The author, who has financial issues and can't cook much, felt treated poorly and snapped at him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which she ate because she hadn't eaten all day. He then made her clean up, and when she objected, he got angry and called her names. The author's response was to snap back, which led to the argument.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and mutual consideration in a relationship. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as dismissive. Even if he wasn't obligated to cook for her, giving her the leftovers and then expecting her to clean up might be seen as taking advantage. The fact that she's in a financial situation where she can't cook much herself adds context. The boyfriend's response to her trying to eat the leftovers (which were minimal) by pushing her and calling her names is abusive, both emotionally and physically.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did confront him, but under the context of feeling consistently mistreated. She mentions he's not generous and treats her like a dog or roommate. Her outburst was in response to his aggression. While confronting someone can be seen as standing up for oneself, the boyfriend's behavior crosses into abusive territory with the physical restraint and yelling.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. The boyfriend's actions seem to lack empathy and respect for her situation. The author's reaction, while perhaps heated, is a response to ongoing mistreatment. So, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author isn't entirely in the wrong for defending herself.\n"
