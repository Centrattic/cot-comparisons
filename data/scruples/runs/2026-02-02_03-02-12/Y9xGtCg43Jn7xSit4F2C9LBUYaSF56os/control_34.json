Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is wrong in her situation. Let's go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's a terrible cook and can't afford meat often. Her boyfriend cooked a stew for himself, and despite having enough ingredients, refused to make a portion for her. Later, when he had leftovers, he gave her a small amount. Then he expected her to clean up after cooking. She snapped because she felt he wasn't being kind, just giving leftovers. He reacted angrily, calling her ungrateful.\n\nThe key points here are financial constraints, unequal contributions in the relationship, and the boyfriend's behavior. The author can't afford groceries, so she relies on him for meals. However, he cooked for himself and then gave her leftovers, which she saw as insufficient. His reaction to her frustration was aggressive\u2014pushing her, restraining, and yelling. \n\nThe author's outburst was in response to being treated unfairly. She felt unappreciated and mistreated. He expected her to do the dishes even though he was the one who cooked. The question is whether her response was justified.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions seem problematic. Cooking for himself and giving her leftovers without considering her needs isn't generous. His physical aggression is a major red flag. The author's frustration is understandable given the circumstances. She expressed her feelings when pushed, which is a valid reaction to being treated poorly. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to share a meal, giving minimal leftovers, and using aggression\u2014is the real issue here. The answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
