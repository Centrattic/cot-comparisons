Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand it properly.\n\nThe author is in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend. She's not a good cook and can't afford meat, so she relies on basics. Her boyfriend is financially stable. He cooks a meaty stew, which she asks to have a portion of. He says no, but later offers her leftovers after she eats barely two spoonfuls. Then she has to clean up, and when she resists, he gets angry and pushes her. She snaps, tells him off, and he calls her names.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooking for himself and then giving leftovers. She asked to share, but he refused. Then he gives her leftovers after eating his meal. She's hungry and takes what's left. Then he demands she cleans up, leading to a physical altercation. \n\nThe author's main point is that the boyfriend treats her like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. She's frustrated because he's not sharing fairly and expects her to clean up without consideration. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect is key. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to share, giving minimal leftovers, and then using that as an excuse to make her clean, even physically pushing her\u2014is problematic. Physical aggression is a red flag. \n\nShe's in a financial situation where she can't cook much, so relying on him for meals when he has the means is understandable. However, when he cooks for himself and then expects her to clean up after giving her scraps, it's not equitable. Her frustration is valid. \n\nThe boyfriend's response\u2014calling her an ungrateful bitch\u2014shows a lack of empathy and respect. His physical aggression makes it clear he's in the wrong. The author had to defend herself, which is reasonable when faced with abuse. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself in an abusive situation. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. She's right to feel mistreated and to express her anger. The key here is that the boyfriend's behavior crosses into abusive territory, making the author justified in her reaction.\n"
