Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions her financial struggles\u2014she's poor, can't afford meat often. She's studying and asked her boyfriend to cook a portion for her when he made stew. He initially said no but later gave her leftovers. Then he told her to clean the dishes, she resisted, got into a physical altercation, and she snapped at him. Now, the question is if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, yet he cooked for himself and gave her leftovers. The author tried to ask for a meal but was denied. Then he expected her to do dishes after giving her minimal food. The author felt treated unfairly, like a servant, not a partner. She called him out on that, leading to an argument.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and support are important. He didn't share the meal equally, and she had valid reasons for being upset. His behavior of pushing her and calling her names is abusive. The author standing up for herself by expressing her frustration seems justified given the circumstances. She's not in the wrong for speaking out against being mistreated. So the answer should be B.\n"
