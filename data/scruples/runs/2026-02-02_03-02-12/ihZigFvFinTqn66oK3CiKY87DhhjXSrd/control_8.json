My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're an asshole for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The backstory is pretty intense. The mom was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse. She left the state and couldn't contact them until they were 18. The author was in a foster home and then adopted by a new family they love. When the mom finally got in touch, she apologized and shared more info, but it turned out she didn't even know the author's father. She\u2019s clean now, found faith, and wants to be part of their life.\n\nThe author hasn't spoken to her since that initial contact. The mom keeps sending love texts, but the author doesn't respond. The author feels conflicted because they want to know more about their heritage but can't bring themselves to love her back. They feel she's a stranger and can't forgive her past actions.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the mom did abandon them due to serious issues and was legally prevented from contacting them. Now she's trying to reconnect, but the author is hurt and doesn't feel the bond. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite; they're dealing with trauma and a lack of trust. They\u2019re not rejecting her attempts, just not engaging. Maybe the problem is the mom keeps texting without giving the author space. But the author isn't required to respond if they\u2019re not ready. They might need more time or boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to show she's changed and wants to be part of their life. But she also caused them pain. The author's feelings are valid. They might not be in the wrong for not responding. The key points are the history of abuse and neglect, the sudden contact after years of absence, and the author's emotional struggle. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid reasons. But since the question is about the author being the asshole, I think the answer is B\u2014No, they\u2019re not in the wrong. They\u2019re dealing with deep-seated issues and aren't obligated to respond if they\u2019re not ready. The mom should respect their need for space until they're comfortable.\n"
