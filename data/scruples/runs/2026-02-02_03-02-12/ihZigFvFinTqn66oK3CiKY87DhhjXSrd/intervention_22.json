My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy. The mom was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being put in foster care and then adopted. When the author turned 18, the mom reconnected, but the author feels conflicted and hasn't responded to her messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mother was absent for most of their life due to legal issues and drug addiction. The author didn't know her for years and only reconnected recently. The mom is now trying to be part of the author's life, but the author feels like a stranger. The author hasn't returned love or messages, which the mom sends.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and the sudden reconnection. The author might be dealing with trauma and resentment. The mom's actions in the past caused the separation, so the author might not feel it's their responsibility to respond emotionally. The author's adoptive parents are supportive, which is a positive. The mom is now clean and trying to make amends, but the author is struggling to forgive. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mom's behavior in the past was harmful, so the author's hesitation is understandable. The author isn't ignoring them out of malice but because of past trauma. The question is about whether the author is wrong for not responding. Since the author has valid reasons and the mother's absence was significant, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They can choose their boundaries, even if it means not engaging. So the answer is B.\n"
