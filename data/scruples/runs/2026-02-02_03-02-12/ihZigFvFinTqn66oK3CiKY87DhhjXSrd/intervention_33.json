My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mother had a history of drug abuse and neglect, leading to the child being placed in foster care. The child was then adopted, which probably had a big impact on their life. The mother couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she was apologetic but couldn't provide answers the author needed. Now, the mother texts regularly with love messages, but the author doesn't respond because they feel disconnected and hurt.\n\nThe author's reasoning for not responding is understandable. The mother abandoned them, and even after reconnecting, there's unresolved trauma. The author might not feel obligated to reciprocate affection after such a long period of absence and neglect. Also, the mother's past actions caused significant harm, so the author's emotional distance is a valid reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to rebuild the relationship, and the author is dismissing her efforts. But considering the history, the author's decision to not engage is a form of self-preservation. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such traumatic experiences.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author isn't being unkind on purpose; they're dealing with deep-seated issues. The mother's actions in the past make the current situation complicated, and the author's emotional response is justified.\n"
