My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The author describes a difficult background where their mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six. They were placed in a foster home and adopted, growing up with a stepfather and a different cultural background. After turning 18, the mother reached out, but the conversation revealed that the mother didn't know the author's biological father or their nationality, which caused emotional pain. Now, the mother sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond and feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The mother was absent for most of the author's life, had legal issues, and wasn't allowed to contact them until 18. The author's decision to remain distant could stem from unresolved trauma, feelings of betrayal, or simply not being ready to reconnect. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be well-meaning, but the author's lack of response isn't necessarily a sign of being an asshole. It's important to recognize that healing takes time, especially after such a significant absence and the revelation of painful truths.\n\nNext, the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on societal expectations of how one should behave in a situation. In this case, societal norms might suggest that one should at least acknowledge a parent's love, but it's also valid for the author to prioritize their emotional well-being. The author's experience with their mother's past actions and the subsequent emotional impact can't be overlooked. They might not have the capacity to forgive or engage right now, which is understandable.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's perspective. She claims to be clean, found religion, and wants to make amends. However, the author's trust might be irreparably damaged. The mother's presence in the author's life was abruptly cut off due to legal reasons, and reconnecting now isn't straightforward. The author's right to set boundaries and protect themselves from potential further harm is a crucial factor here.\n\nAdditionally, the author's mental health and personal growth are significant. They mention having ADHD and mild medical issues, which might affect their ability to process complex emotions related to their mother. Their decision to not respond could be a coping mechanism rather than a malicious choice. It's not about being right or wrong but about what's healthiest for the author at this time.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother is reaching out with positive intentions, the author's lack of response isn't inherently wrong given their history. The key here is that the author is prioritizing their emotional needs and safety. Society often judges such situations based on expectations of forgiveness and reconciliation, but individual circumstances and trauma play a massive role. The author isn't in the wrong; they're dealing with the aftermath of a complicated past and are navigating their feelings at their own pace.\n"
