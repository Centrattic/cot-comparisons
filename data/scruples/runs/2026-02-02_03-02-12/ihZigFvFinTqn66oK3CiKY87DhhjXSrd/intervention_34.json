My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts. The situation is complex. The mother had a troubled past, left when the kid was 6, and they were separated until the author turned 18. When they reconnect, the mom is apologetic but the author feels unresolved issues and can't return the love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's actions. She was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being placed in foster care. The legal separation meant the author couldn't contact her until 18. That's a significant period of absence. The mother's return after 18 years, even with apologies and attempts to reconnect, might not erase the trauma of abandonment and the lack of presence during the author's childhood.\n\nThe author's response is to ignore the mother's messages. They mention not being able to love her back, which is understandable given the history. The author has valid reasons for feeling disconnected. The mother's actions caused lasting harm, and expecting an immediate emotional reconciliation might be unrealistic. The author is not obligated to reciprocate feelings if they haven't healed from the past.\n\nHowever, some might argue that ignoring the mother could be seen as cutting her off without communication. But given the context, the author is in a tough spot. They're dealing with their own emotional barriers and the mother's past behavior. The author's decision to not respond is a personal choice, not necessarily a malicious one. The mother's actions were the initial issue, so the author isn't at fault here.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author has a new family that raised them and they have a good relationship with them might influence their perspective. The biological mother's role is complicated by her absence and the author's need to process their identity. The author's struggle with identity questions and the mother's inability to provide answers adds another layer of hurt.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are rooted in the trauma and neglect they experienced. The mother's part in the situation is the main issue. The author is within their rights to set boundaries and not engage if they feel it's necessary for their emotional well-being.\n"
