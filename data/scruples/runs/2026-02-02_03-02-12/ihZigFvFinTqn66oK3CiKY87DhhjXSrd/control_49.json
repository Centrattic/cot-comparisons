My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is at fault for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom had a troubled past, including child neglect, drug abuse, and was separated from the author since they were 6. The author was placed in foster care and later adopted, which seems to have been a positive experience. After turning 18, the author reconnects with their mom, but the mom's responses to the author's questions are unhelpful and vague. The author then stops talking to her and ignores her messages, leading to the current situation where the mom messages with love and encouragement, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect, the author's emotional trauma, the lack of closure or satisfactory answers, and the current intentional silence. The author feels that the mom was absent for most of their life, provided no support during critical years, and then, when contacting, doesn't give the information the author needed. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author can't bring themselves to respond.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. The options are A (yes, at fault) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother is reaching out, showing effort to be part of the author's life and expressing remorse. Not responding might be seen as cutting off communication, which could be hurtful. On the other hand, the author has a history of trauma and abandonment, and their decision to cut off contact might be a protective mechanism. They might not feel capable of forgiveness or reconciliation without some form of accountability or understanding from the mother.\n\nAlso, societal perspectives can vary. Some might argue that family is important and that the author should at least acknowledge the messages. Others might argue that the author is justified in their feelings given the mother's past actions. The fact that the author's adoptive parents were supportive could also be a factor here, providing a stable foundation that the author can rely on instead of seeking validation from the biological mother.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of emotional labor and healing. The author might be in a place where they can't emotionally engage with the mother, and forcing themselves to respond might not be healthy. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be genuine, but the author's trauma isn't something that can be easily overcome with simple messages.\n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural context, but the user hasn't provided that. The Native-American and African American adoptive parents might influence the author's perspective, but it's not specified here.\n\nIn \"AITA\" posts, the community often looks at intent and context. The author's intent is to protect themselves from further emotional harm given the mother's history. The mother's intent is to reconnect and apologize. The author isn't necessarily ignoring the messages out of spite but due to unresolved trauma and lack of trust.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and not being able to respond to the mother's messages. The mother's actions were flawed, and the author's response is a consequence of those past actions. It's not a simple case of ignoring someone; it's a complex interplay of past trauma and current emotional capacity. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
