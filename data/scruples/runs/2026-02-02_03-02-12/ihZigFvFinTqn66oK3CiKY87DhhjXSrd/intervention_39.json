My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages. The situation is pretty complex. The mother was involved in child neglect and drug abuse, leading to her being arrested when the author was 6. The author was placed in foster care and adopted. After turning 18, the mother tried to reconnect but the author is struggling with letting go of the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions were severe\u2014child neglect and drug use, leading to the child being taken away. The author's feelings of betrayal and anger are valid. The fact that the mother didn't know the father or the child's nationality suggests a lack of stability and responsibility, which the author might still be dealing with.\n\nThe author hasn't responded to the mother's messages, which the mother interprets as a lack of love. But from the author's perspective, the mother is essentially a stranger. The emotional trauma from being neglected and then suddenly having contact might make it hard to respond. The author is dealing with a lot of unresolved feelings and trust issues.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ignoring someone's messages can seem cold, but considering the history, it's a form of self-protection. The author isn't obligated to have a relationship with someone who caused them harm. The mother's attempts to reconnect are commendable, but the author's right to set boundaries is important. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could find a way to acknowledge the messages without an emotional response. But the question is about being in the wrong. The mother's actions were the root cause of the initial separation. The author's current behavior is a reaction to past trauma. So, no, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decide how and when to engage, if at all.\n"
