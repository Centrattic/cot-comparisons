My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's messages. Their mom had a history of drug abuse, neglect, and was arrested when they were 6. They were in foster care and adopted. After turning 18, the mom reached out again, but the person felt she wasn't honest about their background. Now, the mom sends messages showing she cares, but the person doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's past actions, which were pretty severe. The person had a traumatic experience due to their mom's actions. The mom was absent for a long time and when she reconnected, she didn't have the answers the person needed. The person is struggling to reconnect because of the pain and lack of trust.\n\nI need to consider if the person is in the wrong. The mom is trying to reach out, but the person hasn't forgiven her yet. Is it reasonable for them to hold a grudge? Given the circumstances, it seems like the person is dealing with past trauma. They might not be in the wrong for not responding because they're still processing everything. The mom's actions were harmful, so the person's hesitation makes sense. It's also about boundaries. The person might need time to decide if they want to reconnect. So, the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
