My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six, and they were put in foster care. They were adopted by people they love and had a good upbringing. After turning 18, the mom contacted them via Facebook, but the conversation didn't go well. The person felt the mom was unprepared with answers about their heritage and father's identity, leading to a disconnect. Now the mom is trying to reach out, saying she's sorry and wants to be part of their life, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The mom was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the child until 18. That's a legal restriction, so the author wasn't in contact with her because they were prohibited, not by choice. Then, when they were allowed to contact, the first interaction was emotional, but the author felt the mom's responses were lacking. The author's current stance is that the mom is a stranger, so they can't reciprocate love. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are the mom's past actions, the impact on the author, the author's right to set boundaries, and the mom's current efforts. \n\nThe author has a right to be angry or hurt. The mother's actions led to their separation, and the author was in a foster home. The mother's drug use during pregnancy is a serious issue. The author's adoptive parents were supportive, so the author might have built their identity around that. When the mom reached out, the author's emotional response was justified, and the lack of answers might have compounded the trauma. \n\nNow, the mom is reaching out with love messages, but the author is ignoring them. The author's reasoning is that the mom is a stranger and they can't feel love for her. This is a personal decision. Whether it's right or wrong depends on the relationship dynamics and the author's healing process. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to respond to someone who caused them harm. Building trust takes time, especially after such a traumatic separation. The fact that the author is struggling but hasn't engaged yet might be part of their coping mechanism. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying to make amends and the author could be unkind by not acknowledging her efforts. But considering the history, the author's choice to distance themselves is understandable. It's about healing and personal boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their current stance, given the mother's past and the lack of reconnection.\n"
