My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a history of drug abuse and neglect, leading to their separation when the author was six. They were adopted by a loving family. When the mother reconnected after 18, the author tried to learn about their past but felt let down because the mother couldn't provide answers. Now, the mother sends affectionate messages, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the key points: the mother's past actions, the forced separation, the author's feelings of being abandoned, the lack of closure or real connection after recontact. The author hasn't forgiven her, which is understandable given the trauma. The mother is now clean and repentant, but the author sees her as a stranger.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong for not responding. From a moral standpoint, it's about the right to set boundaries after trauma. The author might feel that reconnecting would be harmful, and they have the right to not engage if they're not ready. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author isn't obligated to reciprocate love immediately. People process and heal at their own pace, especially from such serious issues. The fact that the author is honest about their feelings and hasn't ignored her completely (just not responding) shows some level of respect, but they're not in a place to engage emotionally yet. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because healing from such experiences takes time, and they're not obligated to show love or respond if they're not ready. The mother needs to respect the author's boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
