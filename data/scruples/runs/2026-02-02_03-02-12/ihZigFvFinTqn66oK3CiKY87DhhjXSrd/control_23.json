My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The mother had a history of neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being in a foster home until 18. After being contacted again, the mother's explanations didn't satisfy the author, and they cut off communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the mother's past actions. Neglect, drug abuse, and abandoning the child could cause significant trauma. The author was adopted by a loving family, which probably helped them grow up \"alright\" despite the learning issues. The mother's return after 18 years comes with emotional weight, and the author's hesitation is understandable given the history.\n\nThe mother is now trying to reconnect, expressing remorse and sending messages. However, the author feels it's too late, as the mother was absent for most of their life. The key point is whether the author is obligated to respond positively to someone who caused harm, even if the mother has since changed. \n\nIn such cases, the person's right to set boundaries is crucial. The author isn't ignoring texts out of spite but due to unresolved trauma and a lack of trust. The mother's actions in the past have irrevocably affected the relationship. The author isn't being unkind by not responding; they're protecting their emotional well-being. So, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to decide how to handle the relationship based on their experiences.\n"
