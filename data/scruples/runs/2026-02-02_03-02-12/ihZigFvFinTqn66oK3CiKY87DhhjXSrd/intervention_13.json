My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for ignoring their mom's love texts for four years. Their mom is in Nevada, they're on the West Coast, and she sends messages like \"I love you,\" birthday wishes, etc., but the author never responds. \n\nThe backstory is that when the author was 6, their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, including crack cocaine use. She left the state and couldn't contact the author until they turned 18. The author was placed in foster care and adopted by a new family, whom they love. After turning 18, the mom reached out via Facebook. The author wanted to know about their identity, like their father and nationality, but the mom couldn't provide answers. The mom apologized, said she's clean and in church now, but the author feels she's a stranger and can't love her back. They haven't spoken since that initial contact.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's messages. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The mother abandoned the author as a child due to her own issues. She was involved in drug abuse and neglect, leading to the author being in foster care. The mother was legally prohibited from contacting the author for over a decade. When she finally does reach out, there's a lot of emotional distance because of the years of absence. The author is struggling with their identity and the mother's inability to provide the information they seek. The author's response is to not return the mother's messages, even though the mother is now clean and trying to reconnect.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, this is a nuanced situation. The mother's actions as a parent were harmful and led to the author being separated from her. The author's lack of response could be seen as understandable given the history. However, some might argue that the mother is now trying to make amends and deserves a chance to rebuild the relationship, regardless of past mistakes.\n\nBut the key factors here are the mother's long absence, the traumatic impact on the author, and the author's current emotional state. The author hasn't rejected the mother outright; they just haven't responded to her messages. It's possible the author is still processing their feelings and needs time. The mother's efforts to reach out are positive, but the author's decision to not reciprocate the messages is their personal choice, given their history. \n\nIn many cases, people who have experienced betrayal or abandonment might need time to heal before they can engage in a relationship. The author's decision to not respond could be a form of self-protection, especially if they haven't addressed their feelings yet. It's also possible that the author is struggling with mixed emotions\u2014wanting answers but also feeling anger or hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mother is genuinely trying to reconnect and the author is completely ignoring her, some might see that as unkind. However, given the circumstances, the author's actions are more about their own emotional well-being. They are not necessarily being cruel; they're setting boundaries based on their experiences. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the history of neglect and the author's need to process their feelings, the author is not in the wrong. Their choice to not respond is a personal decision related to their healing process. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
