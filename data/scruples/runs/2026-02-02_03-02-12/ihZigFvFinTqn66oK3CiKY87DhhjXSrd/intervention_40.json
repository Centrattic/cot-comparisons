My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's love texts for four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author was taken from their mother at age 6 due to her being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. They were in foster care and then adopted. The mother wasn't allowed to contact the author until they turned 18. When she did, she reached out via Facebook. The author wanted to know details about their heritage and their mother's absence. The mother admitted to cocaine use, not knowing the father's identity, etc. Now, the mother sends messages expressing love and missing the author, but the author doesn't respond. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nSo, considering the context: The mother had a significant role in the author's absence and the trauma of being taken away. The author has legitimate reasons for not wanting to reconnect. They might feel anger, betrayal, or confusion. The fact that the mother was in and out of their life, and then after 18, only started reaching out might contribute to the author's hesitation. Also, the author's adoption and the new family they're with might mean they have a different sense of identity and family, making it hard to accept this biological mother back into their life.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's lack of response isn't necessarily inconsiderate. They have a right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic and estranged relationship. The mother's actions (drugs, neglect) were harmful, and the author's decision to not engage could be a form of self-protection. The author isn't ignoring out of spite but possibly because they can't emotionally process the situation yet. Also, the mother's current efforts might not be enough to rebuild trust. The author's response (or lack thereof) is a personal choice based on their experiences, and unless there's a clear expectation to respond that the author is ignoring, it's not wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
