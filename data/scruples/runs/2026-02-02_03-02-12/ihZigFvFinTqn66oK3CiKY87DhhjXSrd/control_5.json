My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable for them to ignore their mom's texts for four years, even though she's been trying to reconnect after being absent for most of their life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom was involved in drug abuse and child neglect, leading to her arrest and being forced to leave the state, cutting off contact until the author was 18. The author was adopted and grew up with a loving family. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels hurt and doesn't want to engage. The author isn't responding to her messages, and the mom is expressing love and regret. The author feels conflicted but can't bring themselves to forgive or love her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from an emotional standpoint, the author has been through a lot. Their mother was absent and had serious issues that directly impacted their life. The author's right to feel anger, confusion, or a lack of forgiveness is valid. Healing from such trauma takes time, and it's not something that can be forced. The mom did make an effort to reach out, but the author's decision to not respond isn't necessarily wrong. They might need more time or closure, and it's their choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to make amends and is clean now, which shows effort on her part. But the author isn't obligated to accept that. The key here is that the author isn't being unkind or malicious by not responding; they're processing their feelings. The question is whether withholding love or communication is \"wrong\" in this context. Since the mother was absent for so long and caused harm, the author's hesitation makes sense. They're not ignoring her out of spite but because of unresolved trauma and a lack of trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They have legitimate reasons for their actions, and it's not about being an asshole but about emotional healing and personal boundaries.\n"
