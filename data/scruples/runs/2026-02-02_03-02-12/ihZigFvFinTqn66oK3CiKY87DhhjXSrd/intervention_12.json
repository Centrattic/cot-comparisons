My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. The mom had a history of drug abuse, neglect, and was absent from the author's life until they turned 18. The author was adopted by a different family and now feels disconnected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions were harmful. She was arrested for child neglect and drug use, which led to the author being in foster care and then adopted. That's a significant trauma. The author's current lack of response isn't out of malice but because they see the mother as a stranger now. \n\nEmotionally, the author is struggling with their identity and the mother's absence. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be genuine, but the author hasn't healed. The fact that the mother used drugs during pregnancy adds another layer of betrayal. The author's decision not to reciprocate affection is understandable given the history.\n\nHowever, some might argue that cutting off contact entirely, even if the mother is at fault, could be seen as harsh. But considering the author's experiences, it's not just about ignoring texts\u2014it's about processing years of abandonment and trauma. The mother's actions were legally problematic, which adds severity to the situation.\n\nThe key point here is the author's right to set boundaries. They have the right to not engage if they feel it's necessary for their healing. The mother's attempts at reconciliation don't negate the author's right to protect their emotional well-being. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
