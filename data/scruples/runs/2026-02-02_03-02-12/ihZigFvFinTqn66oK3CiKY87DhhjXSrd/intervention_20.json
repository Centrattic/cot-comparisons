My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, even using crack cocaine during pregnancy. The child was put in foster care and adopted by a new family. Then, after turning 18, the mother reconnected via Facebook. She's been clean, found faith, and is expressing regret and wanting to be part of the author's life. But the author doesn't feel able to reciprocate love and has been ignoring her messages. \n\nThe user says they don't think the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about my take. So I need to evaluate if the author is being an asshole here. The key factors are the mother's past actions and the author's current feelings. The mother was abusive, neglected the child, and caused significant trauma. Now she's reached out, but the author is struggling to forgive her. \n\nIn AITA questions, the main point is often about the actions and their impact, but in this case, the author's emotional response is central. The mother's actions led to the child being separated from her and adopted. The author's non-response might be seen as harsh, but considering the history, it's a matter of personal boundaries and healing. The mother might be expecting a relationship to resume immediately, but the author's trauma and estrangement are valid. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No) because the author is dealing with a complex emotional situation. They have the right to set boundaries and prioritize their own mental health. The mother's attempts might be sincere, but the author isn't obligated to respond, especially if it's causing them distress. \n\nHowever, some might argue that ignoring her completely could be seen as unkind, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable decision. The author hasn't blocked her, just isn't replying, which is a passive way to manage the situation. It's about the author's need to process and whether they can rebuild trust. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they have legitimate reasons for their current stance, and they're not harming anyone by not responding. The mother's actions in the past are the root cause, and the author's decision to ignore is a reflection of their unresolved feelings and the right to protect their own well-being.\n"
