My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. They had a really rough childhood. Their mom was arrested when they were six for neglect and drug abuse, which led to them being in foster care and then adopted. The adoptive parents are described positively. After 18, the biological mom reached out via Facebook. They had a conversation where the mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the person doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's history with their mom is traumatic and legally enforced separation. The adoptive parents provided a stable environment. The user's lack of response isn't just about not saying \"I love you\" but is rooted in deep emotional wounds. The mom's actions caused significant harm, and even though she's clean and apologetic, the user feels disconnected. They view her as a stranger now. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The key factors are the history of abuse and neglect, the forced separation, the user's emotional state, and the fact that the mom's current outreach doesn't negate past actions. The user's decision not to respond could be seen as self-preservation rather than being an asshole. They're not obligated to reciprocate feelings that were severed through trauma. Also, the user has built a life with their adoptive family, which is valid. The mom's messages might be well-intentioned, but the user's right to set boundaries is important here. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong. The user's experience justifies their emotional response. They're not required to forgive or respond immediately. Their adoptive family's support is crucial, and the user's healing process takes time. The mom's actions were harmful, so the user's current stance is understandable. They're not ignoring the messages out of spite but because of unresolved trauma and a lack of trust.\n"
