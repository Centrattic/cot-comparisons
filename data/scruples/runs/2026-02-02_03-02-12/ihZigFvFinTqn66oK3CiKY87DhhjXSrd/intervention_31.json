My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a history of child neglect and drug abuse, leading to their separation. The author was adopted and raised by a different family. After turning 18, they reconnected, but the mom didn't provide the closure or answers the author needed. The author now ignores her messages, not returning the love or affection.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the history of abuse and neglect, the sudden reconnection post-18, and the mom's lack of effort to address past issues. The author is probably struggling with trust and feeling that the mom wasn't there during their childhood. The mom's attempts now might feel insincere or not enough to make up for the past.\n\nI need to consider the emotional impact on the author. Being in foster care and then adopted, they might have built a strong bond with their adoptive parents, which complicates any reconciliation with the biological mom. The author's reluctance to engage isn't just about being mean but about not being able to forgive or trust.\n\nThe question is whether not responding is wrong. From a moral standpoint, if someone is a parent and has wronged you, you're not obligated to respond. But some might argue that cutting off contact entirely is harsh. However, given the circumstances\u2014especially the history of abuse and neglect\u2014it's understandable. The author isn't blocking her, just not replying. That's a middle ground.\n\nAlso, the mom's messages seem to be superficial, expressing love but not addressing the past. The author might feel those messages aren't genuine or helpful. They might need more than just \"I love you\" to start healing. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They have the right to protect their emotional well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
