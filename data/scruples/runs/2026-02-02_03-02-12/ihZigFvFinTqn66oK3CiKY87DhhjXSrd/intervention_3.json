My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author's mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was placed in foster care and later adopted. They couldn't contact their mom until they turned 18. After that, the mom reached out via Facebook, and the author learned some difficult truths about their background. Now, the mom texts them love and support messages, but the author doesn't respond, feeling she's a stranger.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the mother's past actions leading to the child being separated, the emotional impact of reconnection, and the author's decision to not reciprocate affection. The author's reasons are valid\u2014trust is broken, emotional wounds from neglect and drug use, and the mother's absence for so many years. The author's current lack of response might be seen as cutting off a relationship, but given the circumstances, it's more about unresolved trauma and not being ready to reconcile.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if ignoring messages is justified here. The mother is clean now and expresses regret, but the author's experience with abandonment and lack of knowledge about their background could contribute to their feelings. It's their right to set boundaries, especially if they haven't healed from past trauma. The author isn't being cruel; they're emotionally distant due to valid reasons. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because their actions stem from protecting their emotional well-being after significant past harm.\n"
