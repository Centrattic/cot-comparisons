My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background story is crucial. The author had a very traumatic childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. The author was separated from their mother for over a decade and only reconnected after turning 18. The mother's return was emotional, but the author found out she couldn't provide answers about their heritage or parentage, and she admitted to drug use during pregnancy. Since then, the author hasn't spoken to her, even though the mother texts regularly expressing love and regret.\n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're wrong for not responding. The key points here are the history of abandonment, the lack of a consistent relationship, and the emotional impact of the mother's absence. The author hasn't ignored the mother out of spite but because they're still processing the trauma and the mother's role in it. They see her as a stranger who caused harm, even if she's now clean and trying to reconnect.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, it's understandable that someone in this situation might struggle with forgiveness and rebuilding trust. The author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. They have the right to set boundaries, especially if engaging with their mother would cause emotional distress. The mother's texts, while well-intentioned, might not be enough to bridge the gap created by years of absence and neglect. The author isn't rejecting love out of spite but is dealing with the aftermath of a broken relationship. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
