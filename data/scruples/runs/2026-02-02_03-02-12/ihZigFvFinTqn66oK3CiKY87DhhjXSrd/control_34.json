My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a history of drug abuse and child neglect, leading to the author being placed in foster care and later adopted. The biological mother was legally barred from contacting the author until they turned 18. Now, she's trying to reconnect, expressing love and regret.\n\nThe author hasn't responded to her messages for four years. They feel conflicted, not because they don't care, but because they don't see her as a real mother. The author has been raised by adoptive parents they love, and their biological mother's past and absence make it hard to form a bond. The author might be dealing with trauma, neglect, and identity issues. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, cutting someone off after years of no contact, especially a parent, can be seen as harsh. But considering the history\u2014abandonment, drug abuse, and the author's current emotional state\u2014it's understandable. The author isn't ignoring her out of meanness but because of unresolved feelings and a lack of a relationship. \n\nThe key factors here are the mother's past actions, the legal separation, the author's upbringing by adoptive parents, and the emotional impact of reconnecting with a parent who wasn't present. The author isn't rejecting the mother's efforts out of spite but due to valid emotional barriers. So, the answer would lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
