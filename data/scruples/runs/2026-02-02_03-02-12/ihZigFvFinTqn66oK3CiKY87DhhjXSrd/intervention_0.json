My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The author has a complicated background with their mom having a criminal history involving child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels distant and can't reciprocate the love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions as a parent were harmful and legally problematic, which caused long-term separation. The author was in foster care and then adopted by a new family, which probably shaped their identity and sense of family. The mom's return via Facebook after 18 years, while expressing remorse, might not be enough for the author to forgive or reconnect.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal, loss, and confusion about their identity. They might have trust issues or feel that the mom's past actions can't be undone. The mom's current efforts to reconnect might be seen as insincere or too late, especially given the lack of presence in the author's life. The author not responding isn't out of malice but a lack of ability to form an emotional bond with someone who was absent and harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to be part of the author's life now. From her perspective, she's making genuine efforts to rebuild the relationship. However, the author's right to set emotional boundaries is important. They aren't obligated to accept or reciprocate the affection, especially given the history.\n\nLegally, the mom was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the author until 18, which adds another layer. The author's feelings of being a stranger are valid. Healing takes time, and not responding might be a necessary step for the author to protect their emotional well-being. The author isn't ignoring the mom out of spite but due to unresolved trauma and distance.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's more about the author's right to prioritize their healing and set boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
