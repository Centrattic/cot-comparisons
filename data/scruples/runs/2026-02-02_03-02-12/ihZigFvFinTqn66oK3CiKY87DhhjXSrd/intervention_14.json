My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is about purposefully ignoring a mother's messages for four years after reconnection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was taken from their biological mother when they were 6 due to her involvement in child neglect and drug abuse. They were adopted by a new family and had a good upbringing. After turning 18, the biological mother reached out via Facebook, which was emotional. The author learned that their mother couldn't provide answers about their father or heritage and that she had used drugs during pregnancy. Now, the mother sends regular messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond. They feel the mother is a stranger and can't bring themselves to love her back. They're asking if they're the asshole (ITA).\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong, but they want my take. I need to evaluate based on the given info. \n\nFactors to consider: The mother had a history of neglect and drug abuse, which led to the author being placed in foster care. The author's adoptive parents played a significant role in their life, and the biological mother was absent for a long time. There's a legal barrier that prevented contact until 18. The reconnection revealed more unresolved issues, and the author is struggling to reconcile their past with their present family. \n\nThe author's lack of response could be seen as cold, but considering the trauma and absence, it might be a protective measure. They were a child when the mother left and have built their identity with the adoptive parents. The mother's messages, while well-intentioned, might remind the author of painful experiences. It's important to note that healing from such a separation takes time, and not responding doesn't necessarily mean they are wrong. \n\nPossible arguments for being in the wrong (A): The mother is trying to reconnect, and the author isn't responding at all. Maybe the mother deserves some acknowledgment, even if there's no immediate reconciliation. \n\nPossible arguments against (B): The author has a right to set boundaries. The mother's absence and past actions caused harm, and the author isn't obligated to reciprocate emotions. The trauma might be too deep to overcome quickly. \n\nI should also consider the impact on both sides. The author might be experiencing unresolved trauma, guilt, or anger. The mother is expressing remorse, but the author's silence could be their way of coping. \n\nIn similar cases, boundaries are often respected, especially when there's a history of abuse or neglect. The author's decision to not engage might be a form of self-preservation. The fact that the mother was absent for so long and the author's identity was formed without her presence suggests that the author isn't obligated to respond. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason to not reciprocate immediately, given the circumstances. The situation is complex and not a simple matter of right or wrong. The author's emotional response is understandable and rooted in their experiences.\n"
