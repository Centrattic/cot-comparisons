My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're an asshole for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Their mom lives in Nevada, and they're on the West Coast. She sends messages saying she loves them, happy birthday, etc., but the author never responds. \n\nThe backstory is that when the author was 6, their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in foster care and adopted by a new family whom they love. The mom was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact them until they were 18. After that, she reached out via Facebook. The author tried to find out about their heritage and their mom's reasons, but the mom didn't know much and admitted to drug use during pregnancy. Now, the mom is clean and trying to rekindle the relationship, but the author can't find it in themselves to respond. They feel like a stranger and are conflicted about loving her back.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's illegal activities leading to the child being taken away, and the child being in foster care. After turning 18, the mother tries to reconnect, but the author is hurt and hasn't forgiven her. The author isn't responding to messages, which the mother sees as rejection.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. I need to consider the context. The mother had a significant role in the author's life being taken away, which is a traumatic experience. The author is now an adult, and the mother is trying to rebuild the relationship. However, the author hasn't processed the trauma and hasn't accepted the mother's attempts at reconciliation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, forgiveness isn't always required, especially after such a long period of separation and the trauma involved. The author isn't obligated to respond if they're not ready. However, completely ignoring someone's attempts to reconnect might be seen as cutting them off, but given the circumstances, it could be a justified self-defense mechanism. \n\nThe mother is reaching out, but the author might be using the \"ignoring\" as a way to set boundaries, which is their right. The author's decision to not respond doesn't necessarily make them an asshole because they've experienced betrayal and abandonment. It's about their healing process. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions are considered cruel or just a necessary step for their own well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not responding, given their traumatic past. The mother's actions were harmful, and the author is dealing with the aftermath. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
