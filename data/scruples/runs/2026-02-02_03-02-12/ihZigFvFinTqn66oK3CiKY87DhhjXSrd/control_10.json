My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the mother was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was placed in foster care and adopted, which probably affected their relationship with their biological mom. Then, when the author turned 18, the mother tried to reconnect but didn't have answers about the author's background. The mother is now clean, religious, and wants to be part of the author's life again, but the author can't forgive her. They're ignoring her messages, not returning love or affection.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's reasons for not engaging are rooted in past trauma and abandonment. The mother was absent for a long time, had legal issues, and was using drugs during pregnancy. The author feels disconnected because of all that and is struggling to find compassion for someone they see as a stranger despite their efforts to reach out.\n\nI need to consider the moral implications here. Is the author being unreasonable by not responding? Well, the mother's actions caused significant harm. The author's decision to cut off contact could be a form of self-protection. On the other hand, the mother is trying to rebuild the relationship, which is understandable given her remorse and current state of being clean and involved with the church.\n\nBut the author's perspective is that the mother is a stranger, and they can't form a bond because of the history. That's a valid emotional response. People have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic experience. The mother's actions have consequences, and the author isn't obligated to reciprocate love if they don't feel ready.\n\nAlso, the mother initiated contact after 18 years, which is a lot to process. The author's hesitation isn't just about not responding to texts; it's about reconciling with someone who caused lifelong emotional scars. The fact that the author is struggling with their identity because the mother couldn't provide answers adds another layer. The author might feel more resentment or confusion, which isn't something they can just set aside.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being cruel by ignoring messages. They're dealing with their trauma, and their actions are a form of self-care. The mother's behavior in the past is inexcusable, but now she's making amends. However, the author isn't required to accept those amends if they don't feel ready. It's possible the author isn't the asshole here because their actions are a response to valid pain and a need to protect their own well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to not engage, given their history with the mother. The situation isn't a simple case of ignoring someone who loves you; it's about healing from deep-seated emotional wounds.\n"
