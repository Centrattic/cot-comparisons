My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts. The situation is pretty complex. The author's mom had a troubled past, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. After years of separation, the mom reaches out, but the author feels conflicted about reconnecting.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested when the author was 6 for serious issues like child neglect and drug abuse. The author was in foster care and adopted, so there's a lot of trauma there. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author is hesitant. The author hasn't responded to her messages for four years, even though she sends texts expressing love and missing them.\n\nI need to consider the context. The mother's actions in the past had a significant impact on the author's life. The author's feelings of estrangement are understandable given the circumstances. The mother's attempts to reconnect are sincere, but the author hasn't been able to forgive or accept her yet. Is it wrong to not respond? Well, the author isn't ignoring her out of malice but because of unresolved issues. The mother's actions led to a forced separation, and the author is still processing that.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that despite past mistakes, family bonds are important and the author should make an effort. But given the trauma and the fact that the mother was absent for so long, the author's reaction is valid. The author's decision to not respond isn't out of spite but a lack of emotional capacity to reconnect. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
