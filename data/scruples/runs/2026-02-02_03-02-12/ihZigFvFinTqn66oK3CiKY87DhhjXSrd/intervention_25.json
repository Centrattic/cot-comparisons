My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not returning their mom's texts over four years. The question is whether the answer should be A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a very difficult childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six, leading to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted by a new family. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After that, she reached out on Facebook, but the author found out that the mom didn't know much about their background, including their father and nationality. The author is now ignoring the mom's messages of love and support, not responding. The author feels conflicted but justifies it because the mom is a stranger and caused them harm in the past.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the mom's absence for most of the author's life, the unexpected contact after 18, the lack of information from the mom, and the author's emotional response to that. The author isn't responding to messages, even though the mom has changed and is trying to reconnect. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. \n\nIn terms of ethics or social norms, is it wrong to not engage with someone who was absent and caused harm? The author has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect. They were wronged as a child, and the reconnection is causing emotional pain. The mom's attempts to reconnect might be sincere, but the author isn't ready or able to reciprocate. \n\nHowever, from the mom's perspective, she's trying to make amends and show she's changed. But the author isn't obligated to accept that. People have the right to set boundaries, especially after trauma. Not responding doesn't necessarily make the author an asshole; it's a personal choice based on past experiences. \n\nThe mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the author isn't required to forgive or engage. The fact that the author has a supportive adoptive family also plays a role. The author's emotional response is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They're prioritizing their emotional well-being and not engaging with someone who caused them harm. It's their right to decide who to have in their life, especially after such a traumatic history.\n"
