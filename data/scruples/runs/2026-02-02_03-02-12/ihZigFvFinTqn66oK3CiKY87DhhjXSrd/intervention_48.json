My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is about ignoring their mother's texts for four years. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was put into foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After turning 18, the mom reached out, but she couldn't answer the author's questions about their heritage or father. The author hasn't responded to her texts since she started contacting them, even though she's clean and apologetic.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother has a history of neglect and addiction, and the author had a traumatic past. The author might be justified in not wanting to reconnect immediately. On the other hand, the mother is trying to rebuild the relationship and is remorseful. But the author has valid reasons for not being able to reciprocate love yet. They were essentially strangers for a long time. The mother's lack of knowledge about the author's father suggests she wasn't a present parent, which complicates things. The author's feelings of not being able to love her back seem reasonable given the history. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
