My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was put into foster care and adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she reached out via Facebook, and the author had a lot of questions. The mom admitted to using crack during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father. Now the mom sends love and support messages, but the author doesn't respond, feeling she's a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and neglect, the long separation, and the emotional impact. The author hasn't seen their mom since early childhood, and even when they reconnect, the mom's past is a big barrier. The author is struggling with their identity and possibly trauma. Not responding to messages might be a way to set boundaries. The mom is genuinely trying to reconnect, but the author might not be ready or able to forgive or accept her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a personal decision. The author has the right to prioritize their emotional well-being. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the author's lack of response isn't necessarily a bad thing if it's protecting their own mental health. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. Since the mom's actions led to the author's trauma and loss of a normal relationship, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not reciprocating the love immediately. It's about healing and personal boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason for not engaging, given the history and the emotional complexities involved.\n"
