My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're an asshole for ignoring their mom's love messages for four years. \n\nFirst, let's look at the backstory. The user was neglected by their mom when they were young, leading to foster care and adoption. The mom had a lot of issues with drugs and left the state, couldn't contact them until age 18. When they reconnected, the user learned some painful truths about their background, like not knowing their father or nationality. The mom is now clean and trying to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond.\n\nSo, the key points here: the mom did abandon them and had serious issues. The user has a right to be hurt and to set boundaries. They're not ignoring her out of malice but because of past trauma. The mom is reaching out, but the user isn't ready. The user is also dealing with the emotional fallout of discovering their history. \n\nIs it wrong to not respond to someone who's been absent and caused harm? The user's actions are a result of their trauma and need to protect themselves. They're not being ungrateful or cruel without reason. The mom's apologies and attempts to reconnect are real, but healing takes time. The user isn't obligated to immediately forgive or respond. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that a mother's love is unconditional and the user should make an effort. But given the context\u2014abandonment, neglect, and the sudden reemergence of a parent after so long\u2014it's understandable the user is hesitant. The user's adoptive parents are loving, so they have support. \n\nIn the AITA community, they often consider intent and context. The user's intent isn't to be mean but to cope with their past. So the answer is likely B, the user isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not responding, and it's about their mental health and boundaries.\n"
