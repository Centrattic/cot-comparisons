My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's texts for four years. The situation involves a complex history of the mother's past actions leading to the child being placed in foster care and adopted. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which caused her to be separated from her child until the author turned 18.\n\nThe author has been receiving messages from their mother expressing love and missing them, but the author hasn't responded. They explain their reasons, including the trauma of their childhood, the uncertainty about their biological father and nationality, and not feeling a connection since their mother was absent for most of their life. The author feels she's a stranger now, even though she's clean and trying to reconnect.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my take. Let's consider the key points. The mother's past actions were severe and legally mandated separation. The author's decision not to respond is rooted in deep emotional wounds and the need to establish boundaries. The author has valid reasons for not feeling love or wanting to engage, given the history. While the mother is trying to reach out, the author isn't obligated to reciprocate, especially given the lack of prior relationship and the trauma involved. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about personal healing and emotional boundaries. The author isn't being cruel without reason; they're protecting themselves from potential hurt. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. The situation is about healing and personal choice, not a simple matter of being right or wrong in a social context.\n"
