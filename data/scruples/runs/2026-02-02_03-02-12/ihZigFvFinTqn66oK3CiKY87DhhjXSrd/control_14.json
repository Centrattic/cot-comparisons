My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages. Let me read the situation again.\n\nSo, the author was taken away by their mom when she was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. They were in foster care and adopted. After 18, the mom reached out again. The author tried to connect but was upset by the mom's lack of knowledge about their father and heritage. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom was absent for 18 years due to legal issues and substance abuse. The author was separated at a young age and adopted by others. Reconnecting after so long might be difficult. The author is struggling with their identity and feels the mother didn't provide answers they needed. The mother is now clean and reaching out, but the author sees her as a stranger.\n\nThe core issue is whether not responding to the mother's messages is wrong. The author's reasons are understandable given the history. They might need time to process and build trust. The mother's actions in the past are significant, and the author's emotional response is valid. In many cases, boundaries are important, especially when there's trauma involved. Not responding could be a way to protect their mental health. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries. The answer would be B (No).\n"
