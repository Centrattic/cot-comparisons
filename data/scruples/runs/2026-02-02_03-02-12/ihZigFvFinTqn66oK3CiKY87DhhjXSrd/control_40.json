My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's love messages for four years. The backstory is pretty intense. Their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to them being put in foster care and eventually adopted. The author was separated from their mom until they turned 18, and now the mom is trying to reconnect. She's clean, found religion, and expresses regret, but the author can't bring themselves to respond with love or acknowledge her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic childhood, being split from their biological mother and being in foster care. The mom's actions were illegal and harmful, leading directly to the author's separation from her. Now, the mom is trying to reach out, showing remorse, but the author feels no connection. They've been cut off for years, and the mom's presence in their life was abrupt and painful.\n\nThe author hasn't rejected her out of malice; they're struggling with the fact that she's a stranger despite being their biological mother. They're dealing with the aftermath of abuse and neglect. The author's adoptive parents have been supportive, which might have contributed to their current sense of self and identity. It's possible that the author is still healing and hasn't forgiven their mom, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to make amends. The author not responding could be seen as cutting her off completely. But considering the author's history, their inability to reciprocate love isn't necessarily about being mean; it's about unresolved trauma and the difficulty of rebuilding a relationship from such a broken start.\n\nSo, the key points are the history of abuse and neglect, the sudden reconnection after years of separation, the author's emotional struggles, and the mother's attempts to reconcile. The author isn't being cruel, just emotionally unavailable because of past experiences. Therefore, the answer might be B (they're not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no aspect where the author is being unfair. Maybe the mom deserves a chance to rebuild, but the author's right to set boundaries is also valid. Given the trauma involved, it's more about personal healing than being an asshole. So B seems right.\n"
