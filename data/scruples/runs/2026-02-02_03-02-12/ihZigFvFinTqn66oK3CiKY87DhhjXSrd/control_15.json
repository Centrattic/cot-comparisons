My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years and not returning love. The situation is complex with a lot of background.\n\nFirst, the mother's history: she was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the kid was 6, leading to the child being in foster care and adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact the child until they turned 18. Now, she's reached out, apologized, and is trying to reconnect, but the child is struggling to forgive and accept her.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions towards the child. She abandoned them, had legal issues, and was using drugs during pregnancy. The child had to go through foster care and was adopted, which probably left emotional scars. The mother's current behavior seems to be trying to make amends, but the child is rightfully hurt and doesn't feel the same connection.\n\nThe question is whether the child is in the wrong for not responding or showing love. Well, the mother's actions caused significant harm. The child has every right to feel resentful, confused, and disconnected. Choosing not to engage or show affection after such a traumatic history isn't necessarily wrong. The mother's actions were the root cause, so the child's response is more about self-preservation and emotional boundaries.\n\nAlso, the child is still figuring out their identity, which the mother's lack of knowledge about their father and heritage adds to. It's understandable that they're not ready to accept her love without knowing the full truth. The mother's attempts might be genuine, but the child deserves to heal and decide their own pace.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the child's response is a result of the mother's past actions and their need to process and protect themselves emotionally. It's not about reciprocating love without addressing the trauma first.\n"
