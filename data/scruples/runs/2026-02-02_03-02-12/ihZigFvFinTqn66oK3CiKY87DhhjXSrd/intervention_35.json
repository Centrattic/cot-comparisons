My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the background: the author was in foster care and adopted after their mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse. They couldn't contact her until 18. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't love her back because she's a stranger. They\u2019ve been hurt by her past actions. The mom is clean now and wants to be part of their life, but the author feels disconnected.\n\nI need to consider empathy here. The author's trauma is valid. It's not their responsibility to forgive or respond immediately. The mom did have a chance to be there, but she wasn't, which caused significant harm. The author's silence might be a protective mechanism.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue the mom is trying now, so ignoring her could be seen as cutting off a relationship. But given the context, the author has every right to set boundaries. They were a child when the neglect happened, and the mom's absence was forced and unjust.\n\nThe key points are the mom's legal issues, the author's adoption into a loving home, and the sudden re-entry into their life. The author's emotional distance is a natural response to betrayal and neglect. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
