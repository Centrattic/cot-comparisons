My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The author had a difficult childhood, with their mom being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. She was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the author until they were 18. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the author feels they can't love her back because of past trauma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They went through a lot as a child, being in foster care and adopted. The mom's absence and the reasons behind it\u2014like drug abuse and legal issues\u2014could have caused significant emotional harm. The author's current lack of response might stem from feeling hurt, betrayed, and possibly not ready to forgive or reconnect. It's a natural emotional response to trauma; not everyone can just move on immediately.\n\nThen there's the mom's side. She's trying to make amends, attending church, staying clean, and showing regret. But the author might not see that as enough, especially considering the years of absence and the harm caused. The mom's attempts to reach out are genuine, but they might not understand the depth of the author's feelings. The author is a different person now, with a different family, and the mom is a stranger to them now. That's a valid feeling, especially when the relationship was severed for such a long time and under bad circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. Legally and ethically, people have the right to set boundaries, especially when dealing with trauma. The author isn't obligated to respond to their mother's messages. They're in a difficult position where their emotional needs are prioritized. However, some might argue that the mom is trying to reconnect and deserves a chance. But given the author's history, it's understandable that they haven't returned the affection.\n\nI should also consider the impact on both parties. The mom might feel rejected, but the author's mental health and emotional well-being are crucial. Healing from such a situation takes time, and there's no set timeline. The author's decision not to respond is their way of coping. It's possible they're not ready to engage yet, and that's okay. The wrong here isn't clear-cut. The mom's actions in the past caused harm, but the author's current response is a reaction to that harm. It's more about the mother's past actions than the author's current choice.\n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of a painful past and are setting boundaries to protect themselves. The answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
