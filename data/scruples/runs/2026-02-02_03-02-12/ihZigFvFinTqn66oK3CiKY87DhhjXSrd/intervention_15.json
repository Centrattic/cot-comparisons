My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is an adult now, living in the West Coast, and their mom is in Nevada. They haven't been in contact for four years despite her sending texts expressing love, birthday wishes, and support. The backstory is that when the author was 6, the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and later adopted. The mom was legally barred from contacting them until they turned 18. After that, they reconnected via Facebook, but the author found out the mom didn't know their father or nationality, and she admitted to using drugs during pregnancy. The author hasn't spoken to her since and now ignores her messages.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because the mom is \"clean\" and sorry, but they can't bring themselves to love her back. They're asking if they're the asshole for not responding.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's situation is complex. They had a traumatic childhood due to their mother's actions. The mother's absence and the circumstances of her leaving have clearly left lasting emotional scars. The author's decision to cut off contact might be a form of self-protection, given the history. The fact that they were adopted and raised by a different family suggests they have a strong support system, which might help them in dealing with this estrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reconnect after many years, expressing remorse and a desire to be part of the author's life. The author isn't rejecting her out of malice but because of unresolved pain and a sense of not knowing who she is. The author's emotional response is understandable given the trauma they experienced.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the legal separation that prevented contact until adulthood, and the mother's current efforts to make amends. The author's non-response isn't out of spite but a coping mechanism. It's important to consider that healing from such a deep betrayal and loss takes time, and the author might not be ready for reconciliation yet.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, emotions and personal history play a big role. The author isn't obligated to have a relationship with their mother if that's not healthy or possible for them. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and the author has the right to set boundaries to protect their mental health. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding. They're dealing with the aftermath of a difficult past and may need more time or space to process their feelings.\n"
