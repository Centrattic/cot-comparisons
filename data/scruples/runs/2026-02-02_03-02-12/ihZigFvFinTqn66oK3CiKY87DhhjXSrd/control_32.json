My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person grew up in a really tough environment. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. The adoptive parents are Native-American and African American, which the user loves. After 18, the mom reached out on Facebook, but the user found out she didn't know their father or nationality. The mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy. Now, she's clean, religious, and wants to reconnect, but the user can't bring themselves to respond, even though she sends messages of love. The user hasn't replied in four years and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect, the user's traumatic childhood, the sudden reconnection with a mom who wasn't present for most of their life, and the user's emotional struggle to accept her. The user isn't ignoring out of spite but because of the pain and lack of connection. The mom is trying to make amends, but the user is just not there.\n\nNow, considering whether the user is in the wrong. From a typical social perspective, maybe not. The user has valid reasons rooted in past trauma. They have the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel the relationship isn't healthy. Also, the mom did abandon them and can't just expect instant forgiveness. However, the mom is making efforts to reconnect, which could be seen as a positive, but the user isn't obligated to reciprocate if they're not ready. The user isn't being cruel; they're dealing with their emotions. The fact that they've been in foster care and adopted, which is a significant part of their identity, adds complexity. They might feel disconnected from their biological mother.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying, and ignoring messages is cutting her off without effort. But given the context, the user's response is more about healing and personal boundaries than being a jerk. The trauma of neglect and being in foster care is severe. People with such histories often struggle with trust and feelings towards biological parents. The user isn't ignoring out of malice but because they can't form that emotional connection. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because the user isn't in the wrong. They have a history of trauma and valid reasons for not being able to engage. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the user is prioritizing their emotional well-being by setting boundaries. It's important to recognize that healing takes time, and not everyone can instantly reconcile. The user's decision to not respond isn't a sign of being an asshole but a reflection of their journey and needs.\n"
