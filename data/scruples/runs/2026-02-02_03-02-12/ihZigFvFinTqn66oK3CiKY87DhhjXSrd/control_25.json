My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. They have a complicated background: their mom was arrested when they were six for neglect and drug use, leading to them being in foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, she apologized and explained her past, but the author hasn't spoken to her since. Now, the mom sends messages of love and support, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom was absent for a long time due to legal issues and drug addiction. The child was in a different home, adopted, which probably affected their relationship. When the mom reconnected, she admitted her past and expressed regret, but the author feels she's a stranger. The author is now not responding to her messages.\n\nIs the author wrong for not responding? Well, the situation is complex. The mother was absent for years, had serious issues, and the child was in a different family. The author might have built a life without that mother, and the sudden reentry might be difficult. They might not feel any obligation to respond, especially if they haven't forgiven her or felt any connection. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reconnect and express her love. Even if the past is painful, some might argue that the author should at least acknowledge her efforts. But others might say that the author has every right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic history. The fact that the author hasn't even spoken to her since that initial contact suggests a deep emotional impact and possible trauma. It's possible that the author isn't ready or able to engage, which isn't necessarily being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason for their actions based on their history and emotional state. The answer should be B (No).\n"
