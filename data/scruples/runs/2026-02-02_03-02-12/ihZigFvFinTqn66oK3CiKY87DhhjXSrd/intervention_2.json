My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole for ignoring their mom's love messages for four years. The backstory is that their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to them being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. After turning 18, the mom reached out via Facebook, and they had some emotional conversations where the mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy and being unsure of the author's father. The author hasn't spoken to the mom since and now the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of their relationship. The mom was absent for a long time due to legal issues and addiction. The author was adopted by new parents, which probably provided a stable environment. The sudden reconnection after 18 years of separation is a big deal. The author is dealing with a lot of unresolved emotions and trust issues. The mom, while expressing remorse, might not have a strong foundation to rebuild the relationship from. \n\nThe author's lack of response could stem from feeling betrayed, anger, or not being ready to reconnect. It's understandable that they might struggle with love and forgiveness after such a long period of absence and neglect. The mom is now trying to reach out, but the author might not feel comfortable opening up. \n\nIn terms of \"being in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author is violating any moral obligation. Family relationships are complex, and emotional responses vary. If the author has valid reasons for not engaging\u2014like trauma, lack of trust, or not wanting to reconnect\u2014it's not necessarily wrong. The author isn't ignoring someone's love without cause; they have a history of abandonment and a sudden reentry into their life. The mom, while trying to reconnect, might not have considered the emotional impact on the author.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that responding politely, even if not being emotionally open, could be kinder. But the author isn't cutting off the mom out of spite; they're dealing with past issues. The key here is that the author's decision is a personal one based on their experiences. There's no indication of malicious intent. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because their actions are a result of justified emotional struggles and not a refusal to reciprocate without reason. The answer should be B.\n"
