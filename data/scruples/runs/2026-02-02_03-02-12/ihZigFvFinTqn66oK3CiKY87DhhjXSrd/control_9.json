My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they should return their mom's \"I love you\" texts after four years of not responding. The author has a complicated background with their mom, who was involved in child neglect and drug abuse when the author was a child. They were separated, and only reconnected when the author was 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's actions as a parent were harmful, leading to the child being placed in foster care. The author was left with a lot of unanswered questions and trauma. Now, the mom is trying to re-establish a relationship, but the author feels they don't know her anymore. The author hasn't responded to her attempts at affection, which the mom is clearly trying to make amends for.\n\nThe key here is understanding the author's emotional state. They are dealing with the aftermath of a broken relationship and possible betrayal. The mother's past actions caused significant harm, and the author feels justified in their hesitation. From an outsider's perspective, it's not unreasonable for the author to take time to process these feelings and decide whether to reconnect. The fact that the author hasn't completely cut off communication (they receive texts but don't respond) suggests some level of openness, but not enough to reciprocate emotions yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is making efforts to be part of their life again, expressing love and regret. But the author might not feel ready to engage in that emotional exchange. The question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. Since the author's experience with their mother was traumatic and they have valid reasons for their current stance, it's more about their right to set boundaries. They might not be in the wrong for not reciprocating immediately, especially given the history.\n\nHowever, some might argue that ignoring someone's attempts at reconciliation could be seen as harsh. But considering the mother's past and the author's lack of a real relationship with her now, it's about the author's emotional well-being. They might need time to heal before they can engage in a meaningful way. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are rooted in a complex history and personal healing process.\n"
