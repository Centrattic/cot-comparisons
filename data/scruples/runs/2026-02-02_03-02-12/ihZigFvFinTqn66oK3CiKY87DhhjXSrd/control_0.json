My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The author was in foster care due to their mom's neglect and drug issues, and then adopted. After turning 18, the mom reached out, but the author found out she couldn't provide answers about their father or nationality. Now the mom sends messages, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions led to the child being in foster care, which is a serious issue. The author's hesitation makes sense because trust is broken. The mom was absent for years, had drug problems, and couldn't provide basic info about the author's heritage. The author feels disconnected and sees the mom as a stranger despite her current efforts to make amends.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to reconnect, expressing regret and staying clean. But the author isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel ready. They have their own life now and the trauma from the past might make it hard to accept the relationship. The fact that the author hasn't spoken to her since the initial contact suggests they might not be ready to engage.\n\nThe key here is whether not responding is considered wrong. Since the author has valid reasons rooted in past trauma and the mother's absence, it's understandable they don't want to communicate. The mom's messages might be well-intentioned, but the author isn't required to reciprocate if they haven't healed. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have the right to set boundaries based on their experiences.\n"
