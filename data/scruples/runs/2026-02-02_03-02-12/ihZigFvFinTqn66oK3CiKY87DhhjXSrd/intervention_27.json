My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages for four years. The author's mom had a history of child neglect, drug abuse, and left the state, cutting off contact until the author turned 18. Now, the mom reaches out, expresses love and regret, but the author can't reciprocate the love, hence ignoring the messages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was removed from their biological mother due to her actions, which were legally enforced. The adoption by a different family happened, so the author was raised by adoptive parents. After turning 18, the mother tries to reconnect, but the author feels disconnected and can't form a bond. The core issue is whether the author is an asshole for not responding to the mother's messages, given the history.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the mother is a stranger, and they can't find it in themselves to love her back. The mother, while clean now, was absent and had a troubled past. The author might be dealing with trauma, abandonment issues, and identity confusion. The adoptive parents are their real parents in a legal and emotional sense.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships are complex. Forgiveness and reconciliation take time, especially after such a damaging history. The author's decision to not engage isn't necessarily malicious; it's about protecting their own emotional well-being. The mother's actions led to the separation, so the author's hesitation is understandable. However, some might argue that cutting off communication entirely without any response could be seen as harsh, especially if the mother is genuinely trying to reconnect.\n\nBut considering the author's perspective, they have the right to set boundaries. The mother's past actions have caused irreversible harm. The author isn't obligated to respond to messages from someone who was absent for most of their life and who contributed to their trauma. The adoptive parents provided a stable, loving environment, and the author's identity is tied to them. The author's decision to not reciprocate the love isn't a matter of being an asshole but rather a personal choice based on their experiences.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's actions stem from a place of unresolved trauma and the right to self-preservation. The mother's past behavior and the legal separation justify the author's emotional distance. It's not about being cruel but about the deep emotional scars that need healing time. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond immediately, especially given the lack of trust and the long period of absence.\n"
