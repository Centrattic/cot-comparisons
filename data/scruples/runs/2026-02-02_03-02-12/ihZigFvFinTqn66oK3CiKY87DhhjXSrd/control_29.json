My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's texts for four years. The author explains their complicated background: their mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in foster care and adopted, which had a big impact on their life. Now, the mom has reached out after 18 years, but the author feels hurt and disconnected, even though the mom is trying to reconnect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom was absent for most of their life due to legal issues and drug addiction. The author was raised by adoptive parents and has formed a strong bond with them. The sudden reconnection from the mom, after such a long time and under traumatic circumstances, might be triggering for the author. The author's decision not to respond is rooted in their emotional pain and the fact that they see their mom as a stranger now. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is expressing remorse and trying to rebuild a relationship. From a typical social perspective, not responding to someone who is trying to connect can be seen as dismissive. However, the key here is the depth of the author's trauma and the sudden reappearance of someone who was absent for so long. The author isn't ignoring someone close; they're dealing with a complicated past and may not feel safe or ready to engage.\n\nIn many cases, setting boundaries after such a history is actually advised by therapists. The author isn't being malicious; they're protecting their emotional well-being. So, while it might seem like the author isn't returning love, their actions are a result of their lived experience and the need to process their feelings at their own pace.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their behavior is a response to their traumatic past and not a lack of care, but a necessary step for their emotional health.\n"
