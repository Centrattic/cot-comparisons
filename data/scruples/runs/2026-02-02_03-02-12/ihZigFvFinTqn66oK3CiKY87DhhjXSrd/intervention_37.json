My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy: their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six, leading to their placement in foster care and adoption. They were cut off from her until they turned 18.\n\nWhen the mom finally reached out, there was a lot of emotional stuff\u2014she admitted to drug use during pregnancy, didn't know the father, etc. The person feels conflicted. They want to know about their heritage but are also hurt and don't know her well. Now, the mom is trying to be part of their life again, but the author can't bring themselves to reciprocate love.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the history of abandonment, the mom's past actions that directly affected the author's childhood, and the current lack of a meaningful relationship. The author's decision not to respond is rooted in unresolved trauma and feelings of being a stranger to their biological mother. The mom's outreach is genuine, but the author isn't ready to reconnect emotionally. \n\nLegally and ethically, can someone be in the wrong for not responding to a parent who caused them harm? The author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. They're not ignoring her out of spite but because they're dealing with the aftermath of a broken relationship. The mom's attempts to reconnect are positive steps, but healing takes time, and the author hasn't been able to get to that place yet. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have legitimate reasons tied to their past experiences. The situation is complex, and it's not a simple case of ignoring someone. It's more about unresolved emotional wounds and the difficulty of rebuilding trust and connection after such a significant loss.\n"
