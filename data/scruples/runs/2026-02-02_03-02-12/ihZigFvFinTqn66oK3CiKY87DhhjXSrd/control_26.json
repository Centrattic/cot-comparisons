My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this question. So, the person is asking if they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. They have a pretty traumatic backstory. Their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to them being in foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18, and when she did, it was through Facebook. The user felt there were unresolved questions but became upset when the mom admitted to using drugs during her pregnancy and not knowing the user's father. Now, the mom sends messages of love and support, but the user doesn't respond. They feel stuck because the mom is a stranger, and they can't bring themselves to love her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The mother's absence was due to legal issues and substance abuse, which is a significant factor. The child was placed in foster care and adopted, so the user has a different family now. The sudden contact after 18 years is a big deal. The user's reaction to the mom's revelations about her past is understandable. It's traumatic to learn that your biological parent used drugs during pregnancy and couldn't maintain a stable life. That could lead to feelings of anger, betrayal, or confusion.\n\nThe user isn't responding to the mom's messages. Is that wrong? Well, it's their choice how to handle their relationship. The mom is reaching out, but the user hasn't formed a bond with her. They might not be ready to engage, especially given the history. The user's adoptive parents are important in their life, and the biological mom is a person with a complicated past. The user's right to set boundaries and not feel obligated to respond is key here. They might not have the emotional capacity to engage with someone who caused them so much pain and absence. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying to make amends and the user could at least acknowledge her attempts. But considering the trauma and the sudden contact after so long, it's not a simple matter of just saying \"I love you\" back. The user's feelings are valid. They might need time to process everything, and maybe they don't want a relationship. It's possible that not responding is their way of dealing with the situation, and they're not in the wrong for that. \n\nThe key here is the user's emotional state and the history between them and their mother. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the user's current decision not to respond is a reflection of that unresolved trauma. It's important to validate the user's feelings and understand that healing takes time. They aren't obligated to reconcile immediately, especially when the mother's return comes with so many painful revelations. The user's right to protect their emotional well-being is crucial here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The user's experience and the circumstances make their reaction understandable and justified.\n"
