My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. Their mom had a complicated past, was arrested when they were six, and they were put in foster care. They were adopted by a different family and had a good upbringing. When they turned 18, the mom tried to reconnect, but the person felt hurt because the mom didn't know things about their heritage and had been on drugs. Now the mom messages every holiday and stuff, but the person doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother wasn't there for most of the person's life due to legal issues and addiction. The person has a strong bond with their adoptive parents. Reconnecting after so long with someone who was absent is tough. The person might feel resentment or distrust. They might not be ready to forgive or engage. \n\nIs it wrong not to respond? Well, the person is not obligated to have a relationship with their biological mom. They have the right to set boundaries. The mom might be trying to reach out, but if the child isn't ready, that's their choice. However, completely ignoring messages for four years could be seen as cold, but given the history, maybe it's understandable. The person is in emotional pain and hasn't healed yet. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is showing remorse and trying to connect. The person might be avoiding the relationship out of hurt. But maybe they should at least acknowledge the messages, if not build a relationship. But is acknowledging necessary? The person might feel that any response could be misinterpreted or that they can't be authentic. \n\nLegal and moral responsibilities: The mother didn't have contact for so long; she can't expect a warm welcome. The person isn't in the wrong for not being loving yet. They have the right to take time to accept or forgive. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with deep emotional scars and have the right to their feelings.\n"
