My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The context is about a person who hasn't responded to their mother's love messages for four years. The mother had a troubled past, was arrested when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in foster care and adopted. Now, after reconnecting at 18, the author hasn't responded to any of the mother's affectionate messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother's history of drug abuse, neglect, and the forced separation from the child. The author's emotional response to learning the truth about their parentage and the mother's past. The author's current non-response to the mother's attempts to reconnect. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. From a moral standpoint, this is complex. The mother did abandon the child due to her own actions, which caused significant trauma. The author's feelings of being disconnected and unable to forgive are understandable. The mother is now trying to rebuild the relationship, but the author has valid reasons for their hesitance.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the mother was at fault in the past, the author could show some basic kindness or acknowledgment. But given the history, the author's lack of response might be a protective mechanism. It's also important to note that the author has chosen a different family, which might influence their feelings.\n\nI need to weigh the past actions against the current situation. The mother is expressing remorse, but the author hasn't had the emotional closure or trust to respond. It's a personal decision that depends on healing from past trauma. There's no clear right or wrong here, but considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being.\n"
