My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex with a lot of history.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. The author was placed in a foster home and adopted. That's a big deal. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until they were 18. When she did, the author was flooded with questions but felt let down because the mom couldn't provide answers. The mom has since cleaned up her act and is trying to reconnect, but the author feels she's a stranger now.\n\nThe author doesn't respond to the mom's love texts. The question is, is the author in the wrong? \n\nWell, the author has valid reasons. The mother abandoned them as a child, had serious issues, and caused a lot of emotional pain. The author's adoption by a loving family might have given them a sense of belonging, but the biological mom's reentry is traumatic. The author's trauma and anger are justified. They might not feel obligated to respond to someone who didn't act like a parent when they needed one. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to make amends and is clean now. She's expressing love and regret. But the author isn't in a place to forgive or reciprocate. The key here is that the author isn't avoiding contact to be mean, but because of deep-seated pain and a lack of trust. So, it's more about emotional healing than being a jerk. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and abuse. Not responding isn't them being an asshole; it's them protecting their emotional well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
