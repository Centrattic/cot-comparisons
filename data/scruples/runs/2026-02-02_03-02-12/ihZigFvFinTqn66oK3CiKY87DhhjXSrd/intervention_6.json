My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's love texts for four years. The author has a complicated background with their mother being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6. They were in foster care and adopted. After turning 18, the mother tried to reconnect via Facebook, but the author found out the mother didn't know important things about their background, like their father's identity or nationality. The author hasn't spoken to her since that conversation, even though the mother sends messages expressing love and regret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mother was absent due to legal issues and drug abuse, leading to the child being in foster care. The mother's absence lasted until the author was 18, which is a significant part of their life. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author is struggling with trust and feelings. The author feels that the mother is a stranger and can't bring themselves to reciprocate love.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's past actions, and the author's emotional response. The mother's attempts to reconnect are genuine, but the author's trauma and lack of connection make it hard to respond. Society often expects people to accept and return love, but this situation is more complex. The author isn't ignoring out of spite but due to valid emotional barriers.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their reaction is based on past trauma and the mother's absence. They're not refusing to engage without reason; they're dealing with the aftermath of being neglected. The mother's actions in the past created the current emotional distance. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond, especially if it's harmful to their mental health. So, the answer should be B.\n"
