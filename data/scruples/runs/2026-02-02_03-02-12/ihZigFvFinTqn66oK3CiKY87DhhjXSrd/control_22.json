My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. The situation is complex with a lot of history.\n\nFirst, the author was neglected and had their mom arrested when they were young. They were put in foster care and adopted, which is significant. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, there was a lot of emotional stuff\u2014she admitted to drug abuse and not knowing their father. The author feels conflicted; they want to know their background but are also hurt and haven't been able to reconnect emotionally.\n\nThe mom has been trying to reach out, sending texts expressing love and wanting to be part of their life. But the author hasn't responded, which is why they're asking if they're the asshole. \n\nNow, considering the context, the author's mom did abandon them due to legal issues related to her actions. The author has a right to feel hurt and disconnected. The fact that they haven't spoken after the initial contact suggests a lack of reconciliation. The mom is clean and trying to make amends, but the author isn't ready to forgive or engage. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to respond. They have valid reasons for their feelings. The mom, while trying to reconnect, has a history of significant negligence. The author's decision to not respond is a personal boundary they're setting based on their experiences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? No. They're dealing with deep emotional wounds and have the right to set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
