My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. They had a complicated past where the mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse, which led to the author being in foster care and then adopted. Now, the mom wants back into their life, but the author feels they can't love her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was absent for a long time due to legal issues and drug problems. The author was raised by adoptive parents who they love. The mother didn't contact them for years until after they turned 18. When she did, she was vague about their father and nationality. The author is struggling to accept her now.\n\nThe author isn't ignoring her completely; they get texts and don't respond. The mother is clean now and seeks forgiveness. But the author feels she's a stranger. People might argue that not responding is cold, but others might see it as justified given the history. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, it's common for people to need time to process and build trust, especially after such trauma. The author's feelings of not being able to love her back might be valid. The mother's actions in the past had legal and emotional consequences. The author's right to set boundaries is important. They might not owe their mother a response if they haven't healed. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that ignoring someone's attempts to reconnect after they've changed could be seen as unforgiving. But considering the mother was absent for so long and caused harm, the author's hesitation makes sense. The key points are the mother's history, the forced separation, and the author's current emotional state. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author has a valid reason to be cautious and hasn't been unkind; they're just not ready to reconnect. Their decision to not respond is a personal boundary, not necessarily wrong.\n"
