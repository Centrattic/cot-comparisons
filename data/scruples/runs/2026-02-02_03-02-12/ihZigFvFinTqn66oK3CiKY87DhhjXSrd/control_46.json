My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts after she was absent for so long. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. She left the state and couldn't contact them until the author was 18. That's a long time. The author was in a foster home and then adopted by another family, which they love. So the author's upbringing was with a different family, and they have learning disabilities and other challenges.\n\nWhen the mom reconnected after 18, there was a lot of emotional stuff. She admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. The author feels conflicted because the mom is trying to reconnect, but they can't find it in themselves to love her back. The author isn't responding to her texts, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nSo, to evaluate if the author is wrong, I need to consider the context. The mother had a significant absence due to legal issues and addiction, which caused the child to be in foster care. The author has been through a lot, including being separated from their mother and having a traumatic childhood. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author is struggling with that because of the past harm.\n\nEmotionally, it's understandable that the author might not be able to reciprocate love immediately. The mother's actions had a lasting impact, and the author might feel resentment or confusion. The mother's attempts to connect are genuine, but the author's trauma and the years of absence might make it hard to form a bond again.\n\nThe key points are: the mother was absent for a significant part of the author's life, there's a history of abuse and neglect, and the author is dealing with the aftermath. The mother is now trying to make amends, but the author hasn't forgiven her yet. In such cases, it's not uncommon for people to have difficulty reconnecting after such a long time and under such circumstances. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of malice but because of unresolved feelings and trauma.\n\nThe answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with the consequences of their mother's past actions and are not obligated to instantly forgive or respond. The mother's attempts to reconnect are positive, but the author's emotional response is valid given their history. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
