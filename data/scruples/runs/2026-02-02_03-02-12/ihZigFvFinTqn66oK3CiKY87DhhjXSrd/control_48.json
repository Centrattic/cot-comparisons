My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested when he was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. He was put in foster care and then adopted. The mom couldn't contact him until he was 18. When she did, she apologized and explained her past drug use, but didn't know details about his father or nationality. Now, she sends messages expressing love and missing him, but the author doesn't respond. He feels she's a stranger now and can't find it in him to love her back.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's absence for years, and the author's justified trauma. The mother's actions had a significant negative impact on his life. Even though she's trying to reconnect, the author is dealing with the aftermath of that trauma. Not responding to her messages is a way of setting boundaries, which is a common reaction when someone has been hurt. It's important to consider that healing takes time, and the author might not be ready to engage. The mother's outreach is positive, but the author isn't obligated to accept it immediately. The emotional distance makes sense given the circumstances. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's prioritizing his emotional well-being.\n"
