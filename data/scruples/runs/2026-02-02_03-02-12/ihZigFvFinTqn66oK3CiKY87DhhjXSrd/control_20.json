My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's texts for four years. The scenario involves a complicated family history with neglect and drug abuse. The author was in foster care and adopted, so there's a clear history of their mother not being present in their life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's actions. She was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which are serious issues. The author wasn't allowed to contact her until 18, so there's a long period of separation. When they finally reconnect, the mother is apologetic and trying to make amends, but the author feels unable to reciprocate love because of the past. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong for not responding. From an ethical standpoint, it's important to recognize that family relationships are complex. The mother's past actions were harmful, but now she's clean and trying to reach out. However, the author has valid reasons for their feelings. They were neglected and abandoned, which can lead to trust issues. Forcing someone to love or respond might not be reasonable. \n\nThe author isn't ignoring her out of malice but because of emotional distance. They might need time to process and rebuild trust. It's their right to set boundaries, especially considering their history. On the other hand, some might argue that cutting off completely could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a personal choice. \n\nI think the key here is the intent. The author isn't being cruel, just emotionally unavailable. The mother's actions in the past were the real wrong, not the current situation. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
