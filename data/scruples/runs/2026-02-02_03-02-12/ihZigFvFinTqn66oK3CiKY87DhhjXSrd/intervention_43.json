My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The backstory is pretty heavy. The mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. After 18, the mom reached out, but the conversation didn't go well because she didn't know the answers the author was looking for, and she admitted to using drugs during pregnancy. Since then, the author hasn't spoken to her again, even though the mom sends messages.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had legal issues that led to the child being separated. The author was in foster care and adopted, which is a significant trauma. Then, when the mom tries to reconnect, the author is met with a lack of answers and the mom's admission of drug use during pregnancy. The author feels that the mom is a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her. \n\nOn the surface, not responding to messages might seem like ignoring someone's attempts to connect, which could be seen as harsh. But in this case, the mother's past actions caused the separation, and the author had to endure foster care and adoption. The author is dealing with the aftermath of that trauma. The mom's messages might be well-intentioned, but the author hasn't had a proper relationship with her and is struggling with trust and forgiveness.\n\nEmotionally, it's a complex situation. The author is within their right to not engage if they feel it's too painful or if they don't feel a connection. The mother's actions in the past had a significant impact on the author's life, and the author is still processing that. Not responding might be a way of setting boundaries, especially if the author hasn't had the chance to build a relationship with her post-18. \n\nSome might argue that the author could at least acknowledge the messages, but considering the history and emotional barriers, it's understandable that they can't. The author is not obligated to reciprocate love or respond to someone who caused them harm, even if that person is their biological parent. The key here is the author's emotional state and their right to protect themselves from further hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They are dealing with the consequences of their mother's actions and are choosing how to handle the situation based on their own emotional needs. The mother might need to work on rebuilding trust, but the author isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel ready.\n"
