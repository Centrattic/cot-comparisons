My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's mother was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was then put into foster care and adopted. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. That's a big deal. The author grew up with a different family, so their relationship with their biological mother was cut off for their entire childhood. That's a significant trauma and loss of identity, especially when they later find out the mother didn't even know their father or their nationality. The mother reached out after 18, but the author didn't respond. The mother keeps texting, expressing love and regret, but the author can't reciprocate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that they feel their mother is a stranger. They have deep-seated issues and can't find it in their heart to love her back. On the other hand, the mother is clean, trying to reconnect, and expressing regret. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, given the history of abandonment and neglect, it's understandable that they might not be ready or able to form a relationship. Their emotional state is valid. They were taken away, their identity was affected, and the mother's actions caused lasting harm. The fact that the mother didn't know basic things about the author's heritage adds to the sense of loss and confusion.\n\nHowever, the mother is trying to reach out now, showing remorse and wanting to be part of the author's life. The author's refusal to respond could be seen as cutting off someone who is attempting to make amends. But considering the trauma, the author's inability to connect isn't without reason. They might need time, therapy, or support to process these feelings. It's a complex emotional situation where both sides have valid points.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a black-and-white issue. The author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with the aftermath of significant abuse and neglect. They have the right to set boundaries and protect their emotional well-being. The mother, while trying to reconnect, might need to respect the author's current emotional state and not force a relationship. So, the answer here would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
