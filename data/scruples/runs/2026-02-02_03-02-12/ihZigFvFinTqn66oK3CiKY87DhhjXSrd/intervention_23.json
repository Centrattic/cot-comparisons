My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's texts for four years. The key points here are the mother's history of child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being placed in foster care and adopted. The mother was legally barred from contacting the child until they turned 18. After recontacting, the child hasn't responded, even though the mother sends messages expressing love and regret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions as a parent were harmful and resulted in the child's removal from her care. The child was then raised by adoptive parents, which is a significant factor. The child's current behavior\u2014ignoring messages\u2014could be seen as a justified response given the history of abandonment and the lack of a built relationship. The mother's attempts to reconnect may not be enough to overcome years of damage and the child's right to emotional boundaries.\n\nThe question is about whether the child is in the wrong. The mother's actions led to the child's removal, which is a serious matter. The child's decision not to respond could be seen as self-preservation rather than a lack of love. The mother's attempts to reconnect, while positive, don't erase the past. The child has the right to determine their own relationships. \n\nSome might argue that not responding is unkind, but considering the circumstances, the child's feelings and trauma are valid. The mother's texts might be part of her healing, but the child isn't obligated to reciprocate. The answer likely leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because of the context of neglect and the child's right to set boundaries.\n"
