My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The author hasn't responded to their mom's messages, even though she's expressing love and trying to reconnect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother had a history of neglect, drug abuse, and legal issues, leading to her child being placed in foster care. The child was adopted and raised by a different family, which seems supportive. The mom was cut off for years and then reconnected after the child turned 18. The author is struggling with the emotional impact of this reunion and the lack of answers or closure.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past behavior, the legal separation, and the emotional trauma. The author feels they have a right to not forgive or respond because of the mother's actions. The mother, on the other hand, is trying to reconnect, but the author sees her as a stranger rather than a mother.\n\nLegally, the mother was forced to leave, but emotionally, the child has been hurt. The author's decision to not respond could be seen as self-protective. They're not obligated to respond to someone who caused them harm, especially when there's no trust or established relationship. The mother's attempts to reconnect might not be enough to overcome the years of absence and neglect.\n\nSociety often expects family relationships to be maintained, but in cases of abuse or neglect, people have the right to distance themselves. The author isn't ignoring someone who was a positive presence; they're ignoring someone who was absent and harmful. The emotional response is valid given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's actions are justified given the history and trauma involved. They are prioritizing their emotional well-being, which is a valid choice.\n"
