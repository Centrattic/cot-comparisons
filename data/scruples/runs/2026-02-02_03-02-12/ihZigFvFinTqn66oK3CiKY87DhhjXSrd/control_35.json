My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's love messages for four years. The author has a complicated background. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6, leading to foster care and adoption. They were cut off contact until 18. After recontact, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels hurt and disconnected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions had a significant impact on the author's life. Being in foster care and adoption by new parents means the author's current family is their primary support. The mother's absence and the reasons behind it (drugs, legal issues) are serious. The author's emotional response is understandable given the trauma and loss. \n\nThe question is whether not responding is wrong. The author isn't ignoring out of spite but because of unresolved pain and feeling disconnected. The mother is now clean and trying to make amends, but the author needs time and healing. The situation is about healing from past trauma, not a simple case of ignoring someone. Society often gives leeway for such situations, recognizing that healing takes time. The author is not being cruel; they're setting boundaries to protect their emotional well-being. The mother's actions in the past make it hard to instantly reciprocate love. So, the author isn't the asshole because they're dealing with legitimate emotional scars and the situation is complex. The answer should be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
