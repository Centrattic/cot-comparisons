My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The context is pretty detailed. The author had a very traumatic childhood where their mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse, leading to their foster care and adoption. After 18, the mom reached out, and the author found out that the mom didn't even know who the author's biological father was, and was using drugs during pregnancy. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has had a long history of being neglected and abandoned by their mother. The mother's actions had a significant impact on the author's life, leading to a complete severance of contact until adulthood. The author's decision not to respond could stem from deep-seated emotional wounds, a lack of trust, or feeling that the mother is only now trying to connect after years of absence. \n\nThe mother, while now clean and seeking a relationship, has a history that caused the author significant pain. The author might feel that the mother is an intruder in their life now, especially given the traumatic past. It's possible that the author doesn't have the emotional capacity to reciprocate the affection without a prior reconciliation or healing of old wounds.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is making an effort to reach out, showing remorse, and is in a better place in her life. She might genuinely want to make amends and be part of the author's life. However, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a history. The fact that the author hasn't responded doesn't necessarily mean they are in the wrong. Healing takes time, and the author might not be ready for a relationship that requires forgiveness or emotional investment.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the traumatic separation, the sudden re-entry of the mother into the author's life, and the author's emotional response. The mother's actions were harmful, and the author's refusal to engage could be a form of self-protection. It's important to recognize that the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond, especially without proper support or reconciliation steps.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not responding, rooted in past trauma and a lack of trust. The mother's messages, while well-intentioned, might not be enough to bridge the gap without addressing the underlying issues first. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
