My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person hasn't been responding to their mom's love texts for four years. The backstory is pretty intense: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being put in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact the author until they turned 18. After that, the author tried to connect but found out the mom didn't know things about their heritage and had used drugs during pregnancy. Now the mom is trying to reach out, but the author isn't returning the love messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had a significant absence in their life due to legal issues and addiction. The author was separated for most of their childhood, which could lead to feelings of abandonment or resentment. The mom's actions had lasting impacts, and the author is dealing with the aftermath of that trauma. The author's current non-response could be a form of emotional protection or a way to set boundaries after years of being neglected.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is expressing remorse, seeking to reconnect, and is clean now. She's trying to be part of their life again. But the author feels like she's a stranger. The question is whether not responding to her messages is wrong. \n\nThe key here is understanding the author's emotional state. They might not feel obligated to reciprocate love because of the past trauma. It's not about being ungrateful but about personal boundaries and healing. The author's decision to not respond doesn't necessarily make them an asshole; it might be a healthy choice given their history. The mom's attempts to reconnect are positive, but the author's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with a complex mix of feelings from a difficult past. Not responding to the mom's messages is their way of coping, not an act of meanness without reason. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
