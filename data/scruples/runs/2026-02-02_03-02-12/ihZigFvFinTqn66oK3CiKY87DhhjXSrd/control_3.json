My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is presented in the context of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario. The author hasn't been responding to their mother's messages for four years. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the background. The author was in foster care and adopted at a young age due to their mother's neglect and drug abuse. The mother was arrested and couldn't contact them until they turned 18. There's a history of trauma here\u2014child neglect, drug use, separation, and uncertainty about their identity and heritage.\n\nThe mother reconnected after 18, but the author is struggling to reconcile the past. The mother has since turned her life around, found faith, and expresses remorse. However, the author feels disconnected, viewing her as a stranger rather than a mother. They don't return her affection or messages.\n\nNow, considering the AITA framework. Typically, being an asshole involves acting selfishly, cruelly, or inconsiderately. The author's actions here are non-communication. But the context is crucial. The author has a history of trauma and neglect. Their emotional response is understandable given the circumstances. They were deprived of a relationship with their biological mother for years, and when reconnected, the mother doesn't provide the answers or connection they hoped for. \n\nThe mother, while expressing remorse and trying to rebuild, might not be aware of the deep emotional scars. But the author's choice to not respond could be seen as cutting off contact, but is that selfish? The author has a right to set boundaries based on their past experiences. They\u2019re not actively harming the mother but are choosing to not engage, which might be part of their healing process.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is making amends and deserves a chance at reconciliation. However, the author's feelings are valid. They might not be ready to forgive or reconnect. The key here is that the author isn't being cruel; they're just not engaging. The mother's actions (reaching out, apologizing) aren't harmful, but the author's non-response is a personal choice rooted in trauma.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic past and may need time to process their feelings. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
