My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages over four years. The author's mom had a history of drug abuse and neglect, leading to the author being in foster care. Now, the mother has reached out after years of no contact, expressing regret and trying to reconnect. The author feels conflicted, doesn't want to reconnect because of the past, and hasn't responded to her mother's messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions in the past were severe\u2014arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which resulted in the child being separated. The author was adopted, which is a significant factor. The mother's current efforts to reconnect come after a long period of absence and legal restrictions. The author's emotional response is understandable given the trauma and lack of a relationship. \n\nThe author isn't ignoring the mother out of spite but because of unresolved pain and a lack of trust. They've mentioned that the mother didn't even know their father or nationality, which adds to the feeling of being a stranger. The author's decision not to respond is more about emotional boundaries than spite. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends, and the author could at least acknowledge her efforts. However, given the history and the emotional impact, it's not the author's fault for not responding. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic past. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with complex emotions and past trauma, making it reasonable to not want to engage without feeling the need to reciprocate love immediately. The mother's actions in the past have lasting effects, and healing takes time.\n"
