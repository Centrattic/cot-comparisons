My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts for 4 years. The author has a complicated background. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6, leading to their placement in foster care. They were adopted by a new family, which they love. After turning 18, the mother contacted them via Facebook, but the conversation left the author feeling empty because the mother couldn't provide answers about their father or heritage. Now, the mother sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions as a parent were harmful, leading to the child's removal. The author's trauma and lack of trust are significant factors. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be genuine, but the author's emotional response is valid given their history. The mother sent the messages, so the onus isn't entirely on the author to initiate contact. The author isn't ignoring messages out of spite but because they feel disconnected and hurt. \n\nAlso, the mother's past actions have legal and emotional weight. The author's right to set boundaries is important. Not responding isn't about being an asshole but about healing and self-protection. The mother's messages might be well-meaning, but the author isn't obligated to reciprocate immediately or at all. The situation is more about the mother needing to earn trust rather than the author being in the wrong for not engaging. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision not to respond is rooted in valid emotional and psychological reasons, not malice. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
