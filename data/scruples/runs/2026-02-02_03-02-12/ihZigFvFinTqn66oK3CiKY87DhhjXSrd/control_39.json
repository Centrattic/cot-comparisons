My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's messages for four years. The author explains a lot of background: their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6, leading to their placement in foster care and adoption. After turning 18, the mother reconnected via Facebook, but the author found out she couldn't provide much information about their heritage or father. The author hasn't communicated with her since, even though she sends messages expressing love and regret. The author feels conflicted but can't bring themselves to love her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions were severe: child neglect, drug use during pregnancy, and abandoning the child. These are serious issues that affect a child's well-being. The author was in foster care and then adopted, which suggests they had a different upbringing. The mother's absence was legally enforced until the author was 18, so the author didn't have contact with her for most of their life.\n\nWhen they did reconnect, the author felt let down by the lack of information and the mother's inability to answer personal questions. The mother's current state is clean and religious, but the author sees her as a stranger. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to her messages.\n\nLegally and ethically, while the mother has expressed remorse, the author has the right to set boundaries. They have a right to emotional space, especially given the trauma. The mother's outreach is positive, but the author isn't obligated to reciprocate. The author's feelings of not being able to love her back are valid, given the circumstances. People can have valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect, especially if trust is broken or if there's unresolved pain.\n\nThe key points are the history of neglect, the mother's past actions, the author's right to emotional autonomy, and the fact that the mother initiated contact after such a long estrangement. The author isn't ignoring messages out of malice but because they haven't healed or formed a relationship. So, the answer is B (Not the author's wrong) because they have legitimate reasons for their actions.\n"
