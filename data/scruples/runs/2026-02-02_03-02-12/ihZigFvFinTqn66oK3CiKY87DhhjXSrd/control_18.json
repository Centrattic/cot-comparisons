My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The situation involves a complicated background where the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug use when the author was six. The author was then placed in foster care and adopted by a new family. After turning 18, the mom reconnected via Facebook, admitted to her past mistakes, and now sends messages expressing love, which the author ignores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their mother, who was absent due to legal issues and drug abuse. The mother's absence led to the author being placed in a different home, which they now love. The mother's return after years of absence, while she was using drugs during pregnancy and couldn't be part of the author's life, is a significant factor. The author feels estranged and doesn't see the mother as a real parent anymore.\n\nThe mother is now clean and trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't responded. The key here is understanding the author's emotional state. They might feel betrayed, hurt, and confused. The mother's actions in the past caused the separation, and now she's reaching out without a strong relationship foundation. The author might not have the capacity to rekindle a relationship quickly, especially given the trauma involved.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, not responding to messages could seem cold, but given the history, it's more about protecting their emotional well-being. The mother's past actions have caused lasting damage, and the author's right to set boundaries is valid. The mother should have given the author space to process and decide if they want to reconnect on their terms. The author isn't obligated to reciprocate love immediately or at all. They need time and perhaps more information to decide their feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. The answer should be B.\n"
