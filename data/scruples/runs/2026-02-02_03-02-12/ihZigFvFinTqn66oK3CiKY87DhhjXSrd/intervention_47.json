My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. Their mom had a rough history\u2014they were neglected, the mom had drug issues, and they were in foster care. After turning 18, the mom tried to reconnect, but the person feels disconnected and can't bring themselves to love her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was absent, involved in drug abuse, and left the child in foster care. That's a lot of trauma. When the mother tried to contact them after 18, it's understandable that the person might feel conflicted. They're still processing their feelings about their mother's past actions and her absence. The mother's messages are nice, but they might come off as insincere to the person, given the history.\n\nThe person isn't ignoring the messages out of spite. They don't feel they can reciprocate love because they see her as a stranger now. They had a different upbringing with their adoptive parents, who they love. Their response (or lack thereof) is rooted in emotional distance and unresolved issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is clean now and wants to rebuild a relationship. But the person has a right to set boundaries after such a traumatic experience. They might need time to process or even decide not to have a relationship. Not responding doesn't necessarily make them the asshole if they're protecting their emotional well-being.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the answer is likely B (the author isn't in the wrong). They're dealing with deep-seated issues and aren't ignoring messages out of malice. Their actions are a result of their past trauma and current emotional state.\n"
