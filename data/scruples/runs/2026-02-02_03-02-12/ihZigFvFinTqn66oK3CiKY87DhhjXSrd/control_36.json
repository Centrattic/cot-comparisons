My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The user is asking for an AITA (Am I the Asshole) judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was taken from their mother when they were 6 due to neglect and drug abuse. They were in foster care and then adopted. The mom was legally prohibited from contacting them until they turned 18. After that, she reached out via Facebook, but the author found out she didn't know basic things about the author's father or heritage. The mom is now trying to reconnect, saying she's clean and wants to be part of the author's life. However, the author feels disconnected, considering her a stranger, and hasn't responded to her messages.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's past actions leading to the separation, the legal barrier preventing contact for years, and the author's current emotional response. The author is not responding to the mother's attempts, including \"I love you\" texts, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author's situation is traumatic. Being neglected, drug-abused by a parent, and then suddenly having that parent reach out after years of absence can be very confusing and painful. The author might not feel ready to reconnect, especially if they feel the mother didn't provide the necessary information about their background. The mother's actions in the past caused serious harm, leading to the author being in the care of others. The author's decision not to respond could be a form of self-protection, given the history.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is now making efforts to be part of the author's life, expressing remorse and trying to reconnect. She's clean and involved in a church, which might be genuine efforts to change. However, the author's feelings of being a stranger to her are valid. The mother's past actions and the lack of contact for so many years could justify the author's current stance.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the question is whether not responding is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything illegal, just not engaging in communication. The mother's attempts at contact might be seen as her trying to make amends, but the author's right to set boundaries is also important. The trauma and the impact of the mother's past actions can't be overlooked.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding. They have a right to protect their emotional well-being, especially after such a traumatic history. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author's response is a reflection of their ongoing healing process. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
