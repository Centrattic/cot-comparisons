My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. Let's start by understanding their situation.\n\nFirst, their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in foster care and then adopted by loving parents. The mom was away for years and couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mom admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. The user feels hurt and doesn't know who their real father is, which is a big deal. They haven't spoken to her since that initial contact and now she texts them regularly expressing love, but the user doesn't respond.\n\nSo the key points here are the history of neglect, abuse, and the mother being absent for so long. The user has valid reasons for not feeling connected. The mother's actions caused significant trauma, and even though she's clean now and remorseful, the user is still processing that. The user is not ignoring the texts out of spite but because they can't form an emotional connection with someone who was absent and responsible for their early hardships.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about emotional well-being. The user is protecting themselves from further hurt. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic experience. The mother's texts might be genuine, but the user's non-response isn't a lack of love but a result of deep-seated issues. So, they aren't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their mental health and healing. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
