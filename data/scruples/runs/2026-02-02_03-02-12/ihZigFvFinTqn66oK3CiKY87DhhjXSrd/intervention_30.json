My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's love texts for four years. The author has a complicated history with their mom, including the mother's arrest for child neglect and drug use when the author was six. They were placed in foster care and adopted, and the mother couldn't contact them until they turned 18. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author is hesitant and doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mother had a history of substance abuse and neglect, leading to the author's removal from her care. The author was raised by adoptive parents and has built a life with them. Now, the mother is reaching out, but the author isn't reciprocating the emotional support. \n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions and the author's current emotional state. The mother's history of drug abuse and neglect would make it hard for the author to reconnect emotionally. The author might feel a mix of anger, betrayal, and confusion. They might also be protecting themselves from potential harm or emotional turmoil by keeping a distance.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is expressing remorse and trying to rebuild the relationship. However, the author's right to set boundaries is important. Healing from such trauma takes time, and not responding doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. It's their choice how to handle their emotions and the relationship, especially given the mother's absence during formative years.\n\nI also need to consider if there's any obligation for the author to respond. The mother is their biological parent, but the author has been raised by others. The author's decision to not engage is a personal one, influenced by their experiences. It's possible that they're still processing the information about their past and the mother's role in it.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often pressure to maintain family ties, but mental health and personal well-being should take precedence. The author isn't ignoring the texts out of spite but due to unresolved feelings and trauma. They might not be ready to reconcile, and that's valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to be cautious and need time to process their feelings. The mother's efforts are commendable, but the author's boundaries are necessary for their own healing.\n"
