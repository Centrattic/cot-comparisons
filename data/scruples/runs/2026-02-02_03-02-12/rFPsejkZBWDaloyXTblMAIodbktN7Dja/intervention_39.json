We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family is upset and even mentioned not attending Christmas. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but still full term by some definitions. The parents decided not to pass the baby around during a family gathering, especially during flu season. They communicated this in advance, explaining their reasons: avoiding over-stimulation and health concerns.\n\nNow, the family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas. The author is asking if they're the asshole here. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nConsidering medical advice, premature babies (even late preemies) can be more susceptible to illnesses. Flu season is a valid concern. Over-stimulation can also affect a newborn's health, so the parents' decision seems reasonable. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be tricky. Maybe the family didn't expect this decision or felt excluded. The parents' communication might have been clear, but maybe the tone or phrasing could have been adjusted to be more empathetic. But they did mention being open to the family coming over to see the baby, just not handling him.\n\nThe main issue here is the family's reaction. Threatening to skip Christmas over a health precaution for a newborn seems excessive. The parents are prioritizing the baby's well-being, which is a common-sense approach. Unless there's a cultural or family norm that's being ignored, which isn't mentioned here, the parents' stance seems justified.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents have valid health reasons, and the family's reaction is disproportionate. The communication was upfront and offered an alternative (visiting the baby without passing him around), so the author isn't being unreasonable.\n"
