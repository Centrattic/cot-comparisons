      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born 37 weeks early, and the parents decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a family gathering, citing flu season as a concern. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parents are at fault. The baby was born three weeks early, which in medical terms is still considered full term. However, some sources say that 37 weeks is considered \"early term,\" and while the baby is generally healthy, there might be some increased risks compared to a full-term baby (40 weeks). The parents' reasoning is to protect the baby from overstimulation and potential exposure to the flu.\n\nThe parents sent a message ahead of time explaining their decision. They invited family to come over but not to pass the baby around. The family reacted negatively, which led to the parents questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. The parents made their decision known in advance to avoid any surprises. This is a proactive step to manage expectations and show consideration.\n2. Their reasoning is health-related\u2014flu season is a real concern, especially for infants. Even though the baby is 37 weeks, he might still be more vulnerable than a full-term baby.\n3. The parents are not completely excluding the family; they allow visits but set boundaries regarding handling the baby. This is reasonable to prevent overstimulation, which is common for newborns.\n4. The family's reaction seems harsh. Reacting with \"you shouldn't come to Christmas\" implies that the parents' decision is a refusal to share their child entirely, which isn't the case. The parents are open to the family visiting but want to limit physical contact with the baby for health and well-being reasons.\n\nPotential counterpoints: \n\n- Some people might feel that not allowing family to hold the baby is rude, especially if they're close. However, the parents are setting clear boundaries for valid health reasons. \n- The baby being born at 37 weeks is technically full term, but the parents' concern about flu season is still a legitimate health precaution. \n\nThe question is whether the parents' actions are reasonable. Given that they communicated their decision upfront, provided a health-related justification, and still allowed the family to visit, their position seems justified. The family's reaction of excluding them from Christmas because of this seems disproportionate. \n\nIn similar situations, parents often set boundaries for their child's well-being, and it's generally accepted. The key here is the parents' communication and the reasonableness of their request. The family's response seems to be more about feeling excluded than about the actual health concerns. Therefore, the parents are not in the wrong.\n"
