We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early term. The parents decided not to let family pass around the baby during a family gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and the flu season. The family took it as a personal offense and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A full-term pregnancy is typically 40 weeks, so 37 weeks is considered early term. Premature babies can have health risks, but the parents mention the baby is \"barely full term,\" so maybe he's doing okay. However, flu season is a real concern for infants, especially if they're not fully developed. The parents are trying to protect the baby's health.\n\nThe parents sent a message in advance, explaining their decision and inviting the family to visit but not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to not come to Christmas. That's a strong response to a decision made for the baby's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, it makes sense to avoid exposing a newborn to flu risks. The parents communicated their decision beforehand, so there was no surprise. The family's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not considered, but that doesn't make the parents' decision wrong. \n\nIn such cases, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child. The family overreacting by threatening to skip Christmas suggests they might have misinterpreted the parents' intentions. The parents were clear and offered an alternative (visiting but not passing the baby), so they're not being unreasonable. \n\nTherefore, the parents are not in the wrong. The correct answer is B.\n"
