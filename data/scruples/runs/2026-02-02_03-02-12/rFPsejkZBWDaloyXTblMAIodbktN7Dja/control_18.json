We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They told their family they wouldn't pass the baby around during Christmas due to flu season concerns. The family then said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The author is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were reasonable. The baby was born three weeks early. While 37 weeks is technically full term, some sources might consider it \"late preterm,\" which can still pose some risks, especially with infections. The flu season is a valid concern here. Parents often take precautions to protect newborns from illness, as their immune systems are still developing.\n\nThe author's message was polite and explained their reasons: avoiding overstimulation and flu concerns. They also invited the family to come over and hang out, just without handling the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to exclude them from the holiday. \n\nFrom a health perspective, the parents are justified in wanting to protect their baby. Socially, setting boundaries, especially for health reasons, is reasonable. The family overreacting by cutting off the parents from Christmas seems extreme. However, family dynamics can be complicated. Maybe there's more context, but based solely on the given info, the parents are making a responsible choice. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
