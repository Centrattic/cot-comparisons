We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. They mentioned it's flu season and they wanted to prevent overstimulation and flu exposure. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the parents are wrong for setting that boundary. Let me think. First, 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources might consider it early term. However, the parents' concern about flu season and overstimulation is valid. New parents often need to set boundaries for their baby's health. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. The parents clearly communicated their reasons in a polite way, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and inviting them to hang out. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. It's possible the family didn't take the parents' concerns seriously and felt slighted. \n\nBut maybe there's cultural expectations where the family expected to hold the baby as part of the celebration. If the parents didn't explain the medical reasons adequately, maybe the family didn't understand. However, in the text, the parents did mention flu season and overstimulation, which are reasonable concerns. \n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to protect their baby's health, and they communicated it politely. The family's reaction is more about their own hurt feelings rather than the parents' actions being wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
