We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents wanted to be safe because it's flu season, so they sent out a message saying they wouldn't be passing the baby around. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nHmm, the parents are making a decision to protect their newborn's health. 37 weeks is considered full-term, but being early can sometimes mean the baby is more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern. The message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out but set a boundary about passing the baby. \n\nThe family reacted strongly, threatening to exclude them from Christmas. That seems harsh. The parents' priority is the baby's well-being, which is a common concern. Many people understand the need for precautions with newborns. Maybe the family felt disrespected or excluded, but the parents didn't say no to seeing them; they just set a health-related boundary. \n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong. They communicated clearly and respectfully, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems over the top. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
