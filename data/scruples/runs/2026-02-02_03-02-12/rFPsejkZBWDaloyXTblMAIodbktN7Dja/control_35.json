We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the context is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe a bit early. They told their family they wouldn't pass the baby around during a family gathering because they're worried about overstimulation and the flu season. Then the family got upset and threatened not to come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were reasonable. The parents are trying to protect their newborn from potential illnesses and stress. Even though 37 weeks is full term, some doctors might still recommend caution. Flu season is a real concern, and newborns can be vulnerable. So, their reasoning seems valid from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The parents just wanted to inform everyone in advance, not to be rude. The family's response was harsh, cutting off the holiday plans if they weren't allowed to hold the baby. That seems a bit over the top. The parents didn't say no to the family coming over; they just didn't want the baby passed around. The family's threat to not come to Christmas seems disproportionate.\n\nBut maybe the issue is how the message was worded. The parents used the phrase \"passing him around,\" which might have come across as implying the family isn't allowed any interaction. However, they did invite the family to come over and hang out, so maybe the family misinterpreted it. The parents' main point was about the baby's health, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nIn terms of cultural expectations, sometimes families expect to hold the new baby at gatherings, especially in close-knit families. The parents might have not considered how important that tradition is to the family. But on the other hand, the family's response of cutting off Christmas if they can't hold the baby seems extreme. It's possible that the parents didn't communicate clearly, but their intention was to protect the baby's health.\n\nSo, the key points are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus the family's expectations. The parents aren't being unreasonable by prioritizing the baby's well-being. The family's threat to cancel Christmas is an overreaction. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
