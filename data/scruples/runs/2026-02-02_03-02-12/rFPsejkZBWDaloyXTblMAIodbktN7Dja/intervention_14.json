We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their preterm baby. The situation is that the baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents wanted to be cautious because it's flu season and decided not to let the family pass the baby around, which they communicated in a Christmas message. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby is \"barely full term,\" which is 37 weeks. While full-term is typically considered 39-40 weeks, 37 weeks is considered early term. However, it's still a full-term baby, just slightly early. The parents' concern is about overstimulation and the flu season. They're not refusing visitors, just not allowing the baby to be passed around. The family's reaction is harsh, leading the parents to question if they're the asshole.\n\nThe parent wrote a text message that's polite, explaining their reasoning. They invite the family to come over and hang out with the baby but want to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family's response is to say they shouldn't attend Christmas if that's the case. \n\nNow, evaluating if the parents are in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, especially with a slightly preterm baby, being cautious makes sense. Preterm babies, even those born at 37 weeks, can have higher risks of complications, including respiratory issues, and are more susceptible to illnesses. The flu is a serious concern for infants, so avoiding exposure is prudent. The parents are not being unreasonable in their decision.\n\nThe family's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or not trusted. However, the parents' actions are in the baby's best interest. The key here is that the parents are not banning visitors entirely but setting boundaries for the baby's well-being. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas seems disproportionate and selfish, prioritizing their own feelings over the health of the newborn.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a fragile baby. Visitors are usually discouraged from handling the baby if it's too young or has health concerns. The parents communicated their decision politely and provided an alternative (visiting but not passing the baby around). Therefore, the parents acted appropriately to protect their child, and the family overreacted.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that 37 weeks is not that early and that the parents are being overly cautious. However, medical guidelines often recommend precautions for early term infants. Also, the parents didn't refuse any interaction, just specific handling. Another angle is that the family's threat is their own choice, but that doesn't make the parents wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. The decision was based on health concerns, and they communicated it respectfully. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' choice.\n"
