We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The situation is during flu season, and they wanted to keep the baby safe. The family was upset and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. A 37-week premature baby is still considered preterm, right? They might have some health risks compared to a full-term baby. Flu season is a real concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, so they're more vulnerable to infections. So the parents' decision to limit handling the baby to prevent overstimulation and potential illness makes sense from a medical standpoint.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The author's text was polite, explaining their reasons without being confrontational. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. But the family took it as an offense, leading to a tense situation about missing Christmas. That seems a bit extreme. Families sometimes have different expectations, but health concerns should be prioritized, especially for a fragile baby.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents' actions were reasonable. They didn't say no to the family coming over; they just wanted to set boundaries for the baby's well-being. The family's response suggests they didn't understand or respect those boundaries, which might indicate that the parents weren't in the wrong. It's about balancing family traditions with the baby's needs. The parents have the right to protect their child's health, even if it means disappointing relatives.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision, and the family's reaction was harsh. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
