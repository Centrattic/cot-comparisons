      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born three weeks early (at 37 weeks) and decided not to let family pass around the newborn during a family gathering, mainly due to flu season concerns. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas. The author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. 37 weeks is considered a full-term birth in some definitions, but it's still earlier than the typical 40 weeks. Premature babies, even by a few weeks, can be more vulnerable to infections. Flu season is a real concern, as the flu can be severe for infants. The parents wanted to protect their child's health, so they set a boundary.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they didn't pass the baby around seems like an overreaction. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons and still inviting the family to visit. They didn't want to exclude anyone, just to protect their baby. The family's response suggests they didn't take the parents' health concerns seriously, which is a problem.\n\nThe key points here are health and safety versus family expectations. The parents are acting in their child's best interest, which is a valid reason. The family members might feel snubbed, but health concerns should take precedence. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious, which is responsible. The family's reaction is the issue, not the parents' decision. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
