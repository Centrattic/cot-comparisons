You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to keep the baby safe to avoid overstimulation and germs. The family took offense and threatened not to come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parents are making a health-related decision to protect their newborn. 37 weeks is considered full term now, but some places might consider it late preterm. However, the main issue is the family's reaction. The parents communicated their decision politely, explaining their reasons. The family's response seems harsh, ending the conversation with a threat about Christmas.\n\nIn terms of medical advice, it's common for parents to limit handling of newborns, especially if there are health concerns. Flu season is a real risk for infants, as their immune systems are not fully developed. Doctors often advise against exposing newborns to large groups or unvaccinated people during flu season.\n\nThe parents' message seems considerate. They invited the family to come over and hang out, just not to pass the baby around. That's a reasonable compromise. The family's reaction seems to be more about feeling slighted rather than a legitimate concern about the baby's well-being. Maybe there's some cultural expectation about family bonding with a new baby that's being ignored, but that's not a valid reason to penalize the parents for making a health-conscious choice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The parents are acting in their baby's best interest. The family's threat seems disproportionate. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a responsible decision and communicated it respectfully. The family's response is the real issue here.\n"
