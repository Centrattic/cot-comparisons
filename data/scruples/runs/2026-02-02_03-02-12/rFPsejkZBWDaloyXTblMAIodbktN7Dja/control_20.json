We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe the parents are being cautious because it's flu season. The parents' message says they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. They're inviting the family over but not allowing them to hold the baby.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they won't pass the baby around is a big deal. But why are the parents making this decision? The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and comfort. Newborns, even if they're full-term, can be fragile. Flu season is a real concern, and hospitals often recommend limiting visitors to protect newborns. Overstimulation is also a valid reason, as newborns can get overwhelmed by too much activity.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel slighted. Maybe they expected to hold the baby, especially during a family gathering. The parents might not have considered how their request could be perceived as a rejection. However, the parents have a legitimate reason, and their decision is in the baby's best interest. The family's response seems disproportionate. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas over this is extreme. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to set boundaries for their child's health and the family's overreaction. The parents aren't being unreasonable; they're making a responsible choice. The family's reaction is more about their own feelings than the baby's well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason, and the family's response is excessive.\n"
