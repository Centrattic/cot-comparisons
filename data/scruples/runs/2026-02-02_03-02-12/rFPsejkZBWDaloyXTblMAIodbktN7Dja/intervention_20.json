      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let family pass around the newborn during a family gathering around Christmas. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're worried about the baby's health, especially since it's flu season. Premature babies, even by a week or two, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. So their decision to limit handling the baby is probably out of concern for the child's well-being. They also mention the baby could be overstimulated, which is a common concern for newborns in busy environments.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they won't pass the baby around is a strong response. It might be that some family members had different priorities, maybe wanting to hold the baby, or not understanding the health concerns. It's possible that the family didn't take into account the parents' reasons, or they felt slighted because they weren't allowed to interact as they wished.\n\nI should think about cultural norms too. In some cultures, holding a newborn is a big deal, and not allowing it might be seen as a slight. But in others, the parents' decisions might take precedence, especially for health reasons. The key here is whether the parents communicated their reasons clearly and politely. The text they sent out was polite, explaining their concerns about overstimulation and flu season. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe family's response of cutting off Christmas seems overreacting. The parents are making a reasonable request to protect their baby, and the family is punishing them for it. The parents aren't refusing interaction entirely\u2014they're inviting the family over to hang out. The issue is specifically about passing the baby around, which they're against. That's a specific and understandable boundary.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents aren't being unreasonable. They're acting in the best interest of their baby's health. The family's reaction is more extreme than the situation warrants. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
