We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn during Christmas. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is still technically full term, but maybe considered \"barely full term\" as they mentioned. The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu and avoid overstimulation, so they informed the family beforehand. However, this led to the family feeling offended and being told they shouldn't come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical advice on handling preterm babies. 37 weeks is considered early term, and such babies might have more delicate health needs. Doctors often advise limiting visitors, especially during flu season, to prevent infections. So from a health perspective, the parents' decision seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The family might have felt they were being excluded or not trusted, leading to hurt feelings. The parents communicated their decision upfront, which is good. The problem is the reaction from the family, which escalated to cutting them out of Christmas. That's a strong response. The parents might not be in the wrong for protecting their child's health, but the family's reaction is also a factor here. However, the question is about the parents' actions, not the family's.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The parents communicated their wishes in advance, 2) Their reasons are health-related and valid, 3) The family's reaction is extreme. In typical AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions are justified. Here, the parents' reasons are legitimate. They have the right to protect their newborn, especially given the medical concerns. The family's offense might stem from misunderstanding or not considering the health risks. The parents are not being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's well-being. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
