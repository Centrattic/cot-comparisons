We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). The parents explained that they wanted to keep the baby safe during flu season, so they announced they wouldn't pass the baby around. The family got offended and said not to come to Christmas. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parents are in the wrong. The key points here are the baby's health and the family's reaction. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but some sources might say 37 weeks is early term. However, the parents mention it's flu season and want to avoid overstimulation. It's reasonable for parents to take precautions to protect their newborn, especially since newborns have fragile immune systems. \n\nThe parents communicated their decision in a polite way, explaining their reasons. They even invited the family to come over and see the baby. The family's reaction seems over the top. It's their choice to not come to Christmas if they felt offended, but that's a harsh response. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. The family's threat to exclude the parents from Christmas seems like an excessive reaction to a reasonable request.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The parents have a valid reason to protect their baby's health, and their communication was clear and polite. The family's response is unreasonable and harsh."
