We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family is upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the baby was born at 37 weeks. While that's considered full term, some people might still think of it as \"barely full term\" and have concerns about the baby's health. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu season risks. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting family to come over. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Not passing the baby around is a common precaution, especially in early weeks. Flu season is a real concern for newborns. It's possible the family didn't take the explanation well and took it personally, maybe interpreting it as the parents not wanting them to interact, rather than a health precaution. \n\nThe parents communicated their decision in advance and offered an alternative. That's reasonable. The family's response of threatening to skip Christmas because of this seems overreactive. So, the parents aren't in the wrong for making a decision to protect their baby's health and setting boundaries. Answer B.\n"
