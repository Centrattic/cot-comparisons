We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They sent a message saying they wouldn't pass the baby around because of flu season and not wanting him overstimulated. The family reacted negatively, leading to a Christmas standoff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The baby is born at 37 weeks, which is early but not extremely preterm. However, flu season is a valid concern. Newborns, especially preterm ones, have weaker immune systems and are more vulnerable to illnesses. Also, passing around a baby can be overstimulating, which is common advice for new parents to protect the baby's health and well-being.\n\nThe parents are trying to set boundaries for their child's health. They invited the family to come over and interact, just not pass the baby around. The family took offense and said not to come to Christmas if that's the case. \n\nOn one hand, the parents are acting in their child's best interest. On the other hand, the family might feel excluded or not trusted. But the parents' decision is reasonable. The message was polite, explaining their reasons. They didn't say no visit, just no passing the baby. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are health concerns and setting boundaries. Their reasons are valid. The family's reaction seems overly harsh. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
