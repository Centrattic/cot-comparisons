We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The scenario is that the author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let their family pass around the newborn. They sent a message explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family reacted strongly, saying if they feel that way, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The baby is barely full term, so maybe there are legitimate health concerns. Flu season is a real risk for newborns, as their immune systems are not fully developed. The author did communicate their decision beforehand, which is good. They offered an alternative for the family to come over and hang out, which shows they still wanted to include them. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not come to Christmas because they can't pass the baby around might be overreacting. The author's primary concern is the baby's health and well-being, which is a valid reason. Sometimes families might have different perspectives, especially if they didn't realize how early 37 weeks is. Maybe there's a lack of understanding about the risks of exposing a newborn to a lot of people and germs.\n\nI should consider if there's any cultural or family tradition that might play into this. Some families might expect to hold the baby immediately, but the author is setting boundaries for a medical reason. The message was polite and explained the reasons. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nAnother angle: the author is taking reasonable precautions. Even though 37 weeks is technically full term, some sources say that 37-38 weeks is considered early for certain risks. The author's decision is reasonable, and they're prioritizing their child's health. The family's reaction could stem from feeling excluded, but that doesn't justify their threat. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated clearly, gave a valid reason, and offered an alternative. The family's response is the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
