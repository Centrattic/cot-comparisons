      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is technically full-term, but just barely. The parents are concerned about over-stimulation and flu season. They sent out a message in advance letting the family know they won't be passing the baby around. The family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' health concerns for the baby and the family's reaction. The parents are making a reasonable request to protect their newborn's health. Flu season is a valid concern, especially for infants who have weaker immune systems. Also, over-stimulation is common for newborns, so limiting handling might be necessary for the baby's well-being.\n\nThe family's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or not allowed to interact with the baby. But the parents are not refusing visitors; they're just not passing the baby around. The parents are being proactive and clear, which is good. They even invited the family to come over and hang out, just not to pass the baby. \n\nThe family's response seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas over this seems like an overreaction. The parents are prioritizing their child's health, which is a valid concern. The family might be used to certain traditions or expectations, but the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety.\n\nTherefore, the parents are not in the wrong. The family's reaction is inappropriate. The answer should be B.\n"
