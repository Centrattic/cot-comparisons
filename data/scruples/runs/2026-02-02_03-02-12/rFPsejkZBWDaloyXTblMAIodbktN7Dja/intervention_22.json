We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but still early by a few weeks. The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu, so they decided not to have family pass him around. They sent a message explaining their reasoning. The family took offense and made a comment about Christmas.\n\nHmm, the parents' main concern is the health of the newborn. Flu season can be dangerous for infants, especially preemies. The parents have a right to prioritize their child's health. But maybe the way they communicated it was off? Let me check the exact text they sent. The message starts with a Merry Christmas and explains they don't want the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. They invite the family to hang out. \n\nSo the message was polite and gave a reason. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's possible they felt excluded or that their traditions were being ignored. However, the parents are making a reasonable choice to protect their baby. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents aren't being selfish; they're being cautious. The family overreacted. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a responsible decision based on their baby's health, communicated it, and the family's response was uncalled for.\n"
