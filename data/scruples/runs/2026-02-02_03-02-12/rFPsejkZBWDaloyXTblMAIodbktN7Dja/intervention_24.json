We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not letting family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The family is upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is a new parent, and their baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely premature. They wanted to protect the baby from the flu during flu season, so they decided not to let family pass him around. They communicated this in advance, explaining their reasons: overstimulation and health concerns.\n\nNow, the family is offended and reacting strongly. The options are whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI should consider common practices. New parents often have rules about handling their newborns, especially if there are health risks. 37 weeks is still early enough that the baby might be more vulnerable. The author provided a legitimate reason and allowed the family to visit, just not to pass the baby around. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe family's reaction seems over-the-top. Threatening to not come to Christmas over this is a strong response. It's possible the family didn't expect such a strict rule, but the parents have every right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The way the author communicated it was polite and in advance, so they gave fair notice. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the family felt excluded or thought it was too soon with a 37-week baby. But 37 weeks is considered full-term in some definitions, but others might see it as preterm. However, the author's main concern is flu season, which is a valid health precaution. Overstimulation is also a common reason for new parents to limit handling of their baby.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're protecting their child's health and setting boundaries. The family's reaction is unreasonable. Answer B.\n"
