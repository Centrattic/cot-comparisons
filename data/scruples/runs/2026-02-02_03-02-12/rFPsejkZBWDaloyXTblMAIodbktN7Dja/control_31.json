      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and even threatened to not come to Christmas if they didn't change their mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe some people consider that \"barely full term.\" The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu, so they set boundaries. They sent a message explaining their decision, but the family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong here.\n\nI should think about the parents' perspective. Newborns, especially those born slightly early, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern. The parents might be doing what's best for their baby's health. They also mentioned that the family can come over and hang out, just not pass the baby around. That seems reasonable to avoid overstimulation. \n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction is intense. Threatening to not come to Christmas is a big deal. Maybe the family felt slighted or not included. They might have expected the baby to be central to the Christmas celebration. But from the parents' side, they have a legitimate health concern. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation that might make the parents seem unreasonable? In some families, seeing the new baby is a big deal, and not allowing physical interaction could be seen as excluding them. However, health concerns are valid, especially with a preterm baby. \n\nI should also consider if the parents communicated clearly. Their message was polite, explaining the reasons (flu season and overstimulation). They invited the family to visit, just not to pass the baby around. That seems respectful. \n\nThe family's response seems overly harsh. Not attending Christmas is a major consequence for the parents' decision. The parents aren't refusing visits altogether; they're just setting a boundary for the baby's safety. It's possible the family felt disrespected, but the parents' main concern was health-related. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the answer often hinges on whether the person acted in a reasonable and respectful way while standing their ground on their own needs. Here, the parents did both. They explained their reasons and set a boundary. The family overreacted. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
