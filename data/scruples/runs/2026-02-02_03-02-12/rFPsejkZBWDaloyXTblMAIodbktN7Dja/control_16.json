We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but the parents mention it's barely full term. They wanted to avoid passing the baby around because of flu season and overstimulation. The family got offended and said not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Newborns, even full-term, can have delicate immune systems, especially if they're slightly premature. Flu season is a real concern. The parents are trying to protect their child's health. But family members might feel personally insulted, thinking their presence is being restricted.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus family expectations. The parents clearly communicated their reasons, which are valid medical concerns. They also invited the family to come over, just not to touch the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they felt disrespected or excluded.\n\nIn similar situations, people often prioritize the baby's well-being. However, cultural or family norms might play a role. The parents did explain their reasoning, so it's not just a blanket \"no,\" but based on health precautions. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parents are trying to balance safety and family relations. The author is not in the wrong because their actions are based on protecting their baby's health, and they communicated it upfront. The family's overreaction doesn't make the parents at fault. Answer B.\n"
