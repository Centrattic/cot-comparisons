We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born three weeks early (at 37 weeks) and the parents deciding not to let their family pass around the baby during a family gathering. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and due to flu season. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The parents are asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that 37 weeks is considered early term, but it's still technically full term. However, babies born at 37 weeks might still be a bit more fragile compared to those born at 40 weeks. Parents might have valid medical concerns, especially during flu season. The parents' message seems polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to come over and hang out. They didn't refuse the family entirely, just not to pass the baby around.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Saying that the parents shouldn't come to Christmas if they don't allow passing the baby is a strong response. It's possible the family might not understand the medical reasons or feel slighted, but their reaction is extreme. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being, which is a common-sense approach. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, some families might expect to interact with a newborn, especially in a large gathering. However, the parents made an exception during flu season, which is a reasonable precaution. The key here is whether the parents' decision was unjustified or rude. Their message was clear and polite, offering alternatives. So, the parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're setting boundaries for the baby's health. The family's response is more about their own hurt feelings rather than the parents being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
