We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended, leading to a Christmas conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is just about full term, but still early by a few weeks. The parents mentioned flu season and wanting to avoid overstimulation. That's a common concern for preemies. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons. \n\nNext, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling someone not to come to Christmas over this issue is extreme. The parents' decision is about the baby's health and well-being, which is a valid concern. They didn't say to not come over; they just wanted to limit passing the baby around. The family's response of cutting off Christmas plans seems like an overreaction.\n\nBut I should also think about the cultural aspect. In some families, not letting them hold the baby might be seen as a slight. However, the parents' main point is health and safety. The message was clear and offered an alternative (visiting the baby without passing him around). There's no indication of rudeness or unnecessary restrictions beyond the stated reasons.\n\nSo, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. The family's response is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than a legitimate health concern. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
