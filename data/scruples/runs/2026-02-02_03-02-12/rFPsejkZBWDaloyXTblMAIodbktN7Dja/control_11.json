We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early by some standards, and the parents not wanting to let their family hold the baby during a visit. The family reacted angrily, saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the norms around newborn care. 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources might consider it \"early full term.\" However, the parents are concerned about the flu season and the baby's health. They communicated their decision in advance, so people could adjust their expectations. \n\nThe parents' reasoning is about protecting the baby from overstimulation and illness. That's a common concern, especially with young infants. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to cancel Christmas because the parents don't want the baby passed around. It's important to consider the parents' right to make healthcare decisions for their child. \n\nIn terms of social norms, there might be expectations that new parents should allow family to hold the baby, but the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The key here is whether the parents' request is reasonable. Since they gave a clear reason (flu season and overstimulation) and communicated it in advance, their stance seems justified. \n\nThe family's response is over the top. Threatening to cancel a holiday gathering because of a health precaution doesn't seem fair. The parents aren't refusing the visit; they're just limiting physical contact with the baby. The question is if the parents are in the wrong, but based on the information, their actions are protective and communicated respectfully. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are making a reasonable health decision, and the family's reaction is excessive.\n"
