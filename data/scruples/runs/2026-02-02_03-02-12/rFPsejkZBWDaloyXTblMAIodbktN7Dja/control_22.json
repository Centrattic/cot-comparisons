We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early (37 weeks is actually full term, right? Wait, full term is 37-40 weeks, so 37 is early but still considered full term. Maybe that's a point of confusion?) The family was told they can't pass around the baby, and the response from the family was cutting off Christmas. The author's message says they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu season concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was justified. The baby is born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some definitions but earlier than 39 weeks. Early full term babies can be more vulnerable to infections compared to those born later. Flu season is a real concern, so parents wanting to protect the baby makes sense. Also, overstimulation for a newborn is a valid reason to limit handling, especially if the baby is still adjusting.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they won't hold the baby might be an overreaction. The author's message was polite and offered an alternative (come over and hang out). The family's reaction could stem from feeling excluded or not being considered, but the parents have a right to prioritize their child's health. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' legitimate health concerns and the family's overreaction. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting boundaries for the baby's well-being. The family's response of cutting ties over not holding the baby seems extreme. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
