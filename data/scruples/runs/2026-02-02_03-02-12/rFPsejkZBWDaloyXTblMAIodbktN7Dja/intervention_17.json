We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but the parents decided not to let family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parents are justified in their decision. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be delicate. Flu season is a real concern, and the parents are trying to protect the baby's health. Also, overstimulation is a common reason for limiting exposure to newborns, especially in the first few weeks. \n\nThe parents' message was polite and explained their reasons. They invited the family to come over but set a boundary about not passing the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh because the parents were clear and reasonable. The key here is whether the parents had a valid reason and communicated it appropriately. \n\nSince they did explain their concerns and offered an alternative (visiting without handling the baby), it's likely they're not in the wrong. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems overreactive. So the answer should be B.\n"
