We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family got offended and even mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, the baby was born three weeks early. 37 weeks is considered preterm, though it's still near full term. The parents wanted to protect the baby from potential illnesses during flu season and avoid overstimulation. Their message was polite and offered an alternative (inviting the family over to meet the baby without passing him around). \n\nThe family took offense and made a harsh comment about not attending Christmas. That's a strong reaction. The parents' intentions seem reasonable and responsible, given the health risks for a preterm infant. Flu season is a valid concern, and overstimulation can be stressful for a newborn. \n\nI wonder if there's a cultural difference here. Maybe in their family, not passing the baby during a holiday is seen as a slight or refusal to welcome the family. But from a health perspective, the parents' decision is cautious and protective. \n\nThe parents didn't say the family couldn't visit; they just wanted to avoid passing the baby. The family's response of threatening to skip Christmas seems excessive. The parents are in a vulnerable position with a new baby and are prioritizing the child's health. \n\nI don't see how the parents are in the wrong here. They communicated their decision clearly and offered an alternative. The family overreacted. So the answer should be B.\n"
