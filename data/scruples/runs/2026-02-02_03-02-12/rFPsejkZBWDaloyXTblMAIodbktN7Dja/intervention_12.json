We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who refused to let their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks, which is considered barely full term. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks are considered early term and might have some risks compared to 39-40 weeks. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation, which are valid reasons for new parents to want to protect their baby.\n\nThe parents' message says they're open to family coming over but just not passing the baby. That seems reasonable. Newborns need a lot of rest, and too much handling can be stressful. Also, flu season is a real concern; even if the family is healthy, there's always a risk of spreading germs. \n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Threating to not attend Christmas because they can't hold the baby is a bit extreme. Family gatherings are important, and refusing to come entirely because of this might indicate they didn't take the parents' concerns seriously. The parents were trying to set boundaries for the baby's well-being, not to exclude the family entirely.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, holding the newborn is a big deal, and the refusal could be seen as a slight. However, the parents communicated their reasons clearly, so it's the family's response that's questionable. The parents aren't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing the baby's health and comfort.\n\nSo the author is not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision for their baby, and the family's reaction is the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
