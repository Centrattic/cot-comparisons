We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family is upset and there's a Christmas reference.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered full term, but some sources might say it's \"early term\". The parents are concerned about flu season and overstimulation. They sent a message explaining their decision. The family reacted angrily, leading to a rift.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' health concerns for the baby and the family's reaction. The parents are setting boundaries to protect their child, which is reasonable. The family's response seems over-the-top. The parents communicated their decision in advance, which shows they considered others' feelings. \n\nHowever, the family might feel excluded or not respected. But the parents' priority is the baby's well-being. The fact that the baby is healthy and the parents are allowing visitors to come over (just not pass the baby around) shows they're not being overly restrictive. \n\nIn similar situations, it's common to set limits with newborns, especially for health reasons. The family's reaction is harsh, possibly because they don't understand the concerns. The parents aren't being cruel; they're being cautious. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
