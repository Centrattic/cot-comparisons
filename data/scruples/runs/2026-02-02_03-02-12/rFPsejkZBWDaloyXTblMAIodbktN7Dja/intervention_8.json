We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early (37 weeks). The family got offended and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The author's message was polite, explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered late preterm. These babies can still have health risks compared to full-term. Parents might be more cautious, especially during flu season. The author's reasoning seems valid. They're prioritizing the baby's health. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas over a health precaution? That's a strong response. The author's message was clear and respectful. They invited the family over but set boundaries. It's reasonable to protect a vulnerable newborn. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family felt excluded or thought the parents were being overly cautious. But given the baby's early birth and flu season, the parents have a legitimate concern. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling slighted. However, the parents aren't in the wrong for setting health boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision for their child's well-being.\n"
