      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. They wanted to avoid over-stimulation and flu exposure during flu season. The family was upset and said if that's how they feel, then they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents are trying to protect their newborn's health. 37 weeks is considered early term, but it's still a full term in some definitions. However, preemies can have more health risks, especially with infections. Flu season is a real concern. The parents communicated their decision politely, but the family took offense.\n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective: their primary concern is their baby's well-being. They're not being selfish; they're making a medical decision. The family's reaction seems harsh. Not passing the baby doesn't mean they don't want to see them. The parents are still inviting the family to hang out, just not handle the baby.\n\nOn the other side, the family might feel hurt or excluded. Maybe they have cultural norms where passing the baby is a tradition. But in this case, the parents have a valid health reason. The family's response of threatening to not attend Christmas seems extreme. It's important to balance family expectations with the parents' need to protect their child.\n\nLegally and medically, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their child. The family's reaction is more about their feelings than the baby's health. The parents' message was polite and clear, so they're not being unreasonable. The family's threat to cancel Christmas over this seems disproportionate. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
