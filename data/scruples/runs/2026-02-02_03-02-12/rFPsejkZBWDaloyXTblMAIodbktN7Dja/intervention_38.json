We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is that they sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around because of overstimulation and flu season, and the family reacted by threatening not to come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early term but not extremely premature. The parents are cautious about exposing the baby to potential illnesses, especially during flu season. They also mention not wanting the baby overstimulated. Their message is polite and gives an explanation, inviting the family to come over and hang out but not to hold the baby. However, the family took offense and escalated the situation to a Christmas Eve threat.\n\nNow, considering medical advice, newborns, even those born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to infections. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend that people with colds or other illnesses avoid contact with newborns. So from a health perspective, the parents' caution is reasonable. Overstimulation is another valid concern for newborns, especially in their first few weeks, as they need time to adjust.\n\nThe parents' message seems respectful and clear. They provided a reason and didn't outright ban the family from coming over. Instead, they set a boundary about handling the baby. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Threatening to exclude them from a family holiday because of a boundary that's in the baby's best interest is harsh. It's possible the family felt slighted or that their traditions were being interfered with, but the parents have a right to protect their child's health.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some families, holding a newborn is a big tradition, and not allowing it might be seen as a slight. But the parents aren't refusing visitors, just handling the baby. It's a balance between family expectations and child safety.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the information, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest and communicated their wishes clearly. The family's negative reaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
