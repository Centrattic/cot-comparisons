We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe the parents felt it wasn't safe to have the baby handled by others during flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents sent a message saying they wouldn't pass the baby around, but family members felt offended and were upset. The key points here are the parents' concerns about the baby's health and the family's reaction.\n\nI should consider the parents' motivations. They want to protect the baby from potential illness and overstimulation, especially since it's flu season. A 37-week baby is technically full term, but some might still be considered preterm and more vulnerable. The parents are making a medical decision they believe is in the baby's best interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas is a serious consequence. Maybe the family felt excluded or thought the parents were being ungracious. However, the parents are not refusing to see the family; they're just not allowing the baby to be passed around. The message invites the family to hang out, which is a compromise.\n\nI need to assess if the parents' decision is reasonable. Protecting a newborn's health is a common practice. Doctors often advise limiting exposure to crowds and unwell people for newborns. Even if the baby is full term, the flu season is a valid concern. The parents are being cautious, which is a responsible approach.\n\nThe family's overreaction might stem from not understanding the medical necessity or feeling that their relationship is being disregarded. However, the parents are not in the wrong for prioritizing their child's health. The family's response seems disproportionate. The parents communicated their decision politely and offered an alternative (visiting but not handling the baby), so they aren't being inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are acting in their baby's best interest, and the family's reaction is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
