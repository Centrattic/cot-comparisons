We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The author's message was about not passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks during flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The baby was born three weeks early but at 37 weeks, which is actually considered full term. Wait, full term is usually 37-42 weeks, so 37 weeks is early term but still technically full term. So maybe some family members might not think the baby is as fragile as the parents do. However, the parents are concerned about the flu season and not overstimulating the baby. \n\nThe parents' reasoning is valid. Newborns, even if born at 37 weeks, can be more susceptible to illnesses, and overstimulation can affect them. The message the parents sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out but just not pass the baby around. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not come to Christmas because of this seems like an overreaction. The parents are making a reasonable request for their baby's health and comfort. \n\nSo, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The key points are the validity of their concerns and how they communicated it. Since they explained their reasons and the family still took offense, it's the family's reaction that seems problematic, not the parents' decision. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
