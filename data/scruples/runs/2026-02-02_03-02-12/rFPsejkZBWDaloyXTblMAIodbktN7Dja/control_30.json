We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let their family pass around the newborn during a family gathering. The family was upset and even threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't get to hold the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents wanted to be cautious because of flu season. They communicated their decision in a friendly way, saying the family is welcome to come over but not to pass the baby around. The family reacted strongly, saying they should stay away from Christmas if that's their stance.\n\nSo, why would the parents be in the wrong? Well, maybe they should be more flexible or consider the family's feelings. On the other hand, protecting a preterm baby from germs is a valid health concern. 37 weeks is still early, and newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. Flu season is a real risk, so the parents' decision is medically sound.\n\nBut the family's reaction is also harsh. The parents communicated their decision politely, so the family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. The parents didn't say they don't want the family there; they just don't want the baby passed around. They even invited the family to hang out. The family might feel slighted, but the parents' priority is the baby's health. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation that you must let family hold a new baby? Maybe in some families, but it's not universal. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's wellbeing. The family's threat to exclude them seems disproportionate. The parents didn't do anything wrong here; they're just being cautious. The family needs to respect the parents' decision. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
