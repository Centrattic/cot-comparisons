You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family was offended and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby is born three weeks early, but 37 weeks is considered early term, which is still considered full-term by some definitions but might have some risks. The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu, so they said they wouldn't pass him around. The family took offense, maybe feeling excluded or not respected.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' decision to limit handling of the baby for health reasons. Newborns, especially those born even a few weeks early, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern, and parents have a right to make decisions to protect their child's health. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, they are acting in the baby's best interest. However, family dynamics can be complicated. The family might have felt that the parents were being exclusionary or not trusting them with the baby, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nBut the parents did invite the family to come over and hang out with the baby. So it's not a complete exclusion. They just want to avoid overstimulation and illness. The family's reaction seems disproportionate, as they are threatening to exclude the parents from Christmas. That seems harsh. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for parents to set boundaries with newborns, especially for health reasons. The parents' message was polite and explained their reasoning. The family's response was overly dramatic. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
