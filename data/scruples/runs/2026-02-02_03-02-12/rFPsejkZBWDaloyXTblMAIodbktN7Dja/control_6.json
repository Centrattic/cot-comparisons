We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe the parents felt he was still a bit early. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to protect the baby. The family took it as an offense, and now there's tension about Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the user wants. They want a decision between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me break down the key points.\n\nParents are concerned about the baby's health, especially since 37 weeks is considered \"early term.\" Even though it's full term, some babies might be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real risk for newborns. They communicated their decision in a polite way, mentioning not wanting him overstimulated and flu concerns. The family's reaction seems harsh, leading to a threat about not coming to Christmas.\n\nFrom a health perspective, protecting a newborn from potential illnesses is a common practice. Parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. However, the family might feel hurt because they expected to interact with the baby, maybe out of excitement or tradition. The problem is whether the parents' decision was unreasonable or if the family overreacted.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, parents are usually supported when they have health concerns. The way the parents phrased their message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to visit otherwise. The family's response seems extreme. So, the parents are likely not the asshole here. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
