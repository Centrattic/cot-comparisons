We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The context is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. They sent a message explaining their decision due to flu season concerns and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but maybe \"barely full term\" could be a factor. The parents want to protect the baby from the flu and overstimulation. The message was meant to set boundaries but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nThe main question is whether the parents' decision was reasonable. From a health perspective, limiting exposure can be prudent, especially with a premature baby. However, the way they communicated it might have been perceived as dismissive or not allowing family interaction. The family felt offended, possibly because they expected to hold the baby. The parents might not be in the wrong for prioritizing the baby's health, but the method of communication could be an issue. The message was clear and polite, though. Maybe the family's reaction is overblown. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
