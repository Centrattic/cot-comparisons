We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during Christmas. The family is upset and even told them not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The author's text was meant to be a heads-up that they wouldn't pass the baby around, explaining concerns about overstimulation and flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but \"barely full term.\" While 37 weeks is technically full term, some sources say that babies born between 37-39 weeks might still need extra care compared to those born at 39-40 weeks. So the parents' concern about the baby's health could be valid, especially during flu season.\n\nThe parents are trying to protect their newborn from potential illnesses, which is a common parental concern. They also mention not wanting the baby overstimulated, which makes sense as newborns can be sensitive to too much activity. Their message was intended to be a polite heads-up, not to exclude the family but to manage their baby's well-being.\n\nHowever, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around is extreme. The parents are setting boundaries to protect their child, which is their right. The family's response might stem from misunderstanding the parents' intentions or feeling excluded, but it's not the parents' fault for prioritizing their baby's health.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' reasonable concerns versus the family's overreaction. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're making a health decision. The family's threat to exclude them for Christmas is disproportionate. Therefore, the parents are not the asshole in this situation.\n"
