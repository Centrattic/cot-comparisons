We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is technically full term but maybe considered \"barely full term.\" The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu during flu season, so they told the family they wouldn't be passing the baby around. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parents' decision is reasonable. Newborns, especially those born even a few weeks early, can be more vulnerable to infections. Flu season is a real concern, and hospitals often advise limiting visitors with young babies. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which seems logical. Their message was polite\u2014they invited the family to come over but not to hold the baby. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not attend Christmas because of health precautions might be an overreaction. The parents didn't ban the family from the event, just from handling the baby. However, family gatherings can be sensitive, and maybe there was more to the situation. But based on the info given, the parents are acting in their child's best interest. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? Sometimes families expect to hold the baby, especially at a big event like Christmas. But the parents have a valid medical reason. The key is whether the parents were rude or if they communicated respectfully. Their message was clear and polite, so they shouldn't be in the wrong. The family's response seems entitled. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
