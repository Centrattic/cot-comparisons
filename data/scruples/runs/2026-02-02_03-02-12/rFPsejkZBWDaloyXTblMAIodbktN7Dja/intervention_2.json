We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is the asshole (AITA) for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is during flu season, so they wanted to keep the baby safe and avoid overstimulation. The family took offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they didn't change their stance.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is about the baby's health and well-being. Premature babies are more vulnerable to illnesses, so avoiding exposure to crowds or sick people is a common precaution. The message they sent out was polite and offered an alternative (visiting the baby but not passing him around). But the family reacted strongly, leading to a potential holiday conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus family expectations. While some might argue that family traditions and togetherness are important, the parents' primary responsibility is to their child's safety. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially since the parents communicated their reasons clearly and respectfully. However, cultural or familial dynamics might play a role here\u2014maybe there's a history of conflict or differing values.\n\nBut generally, protecting a newborn's health isn't unreasonable. The parents aren't refusing to see family entirely; they're just setting boundaries around handling the baby. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas over this seems overly punitive. So, the answer is likely B: the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re making a reasonable decision based on medical advice and common sense, and the family's reaction is disproportionate.\n"
