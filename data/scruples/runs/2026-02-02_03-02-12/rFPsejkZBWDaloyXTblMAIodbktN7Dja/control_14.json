We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Ask the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a baby born 37 weeks early, which is considered preterm. They wanted to keep the baby safe from the flu by not passing him around during a family gathering. They sent a message explaining their decision, but their family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas. The question is if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is technically full-term now, but some sources might still consider it early term. However, even if it's considered full-term, newborns, especially those born a few weeks early, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. The flu season is a valid concern because infections can be dangerous for infants. So from a health perspective, the parents are being cautious, which is responsible.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents communicated their reasons clearly, emphasizing safety and the baby's well-being. They didn't refuse visitors entirely but wanted to avoid passing the baby around, which is a reasonable precaution. The family's reaction seems over-the-top. Threatening to skip Christmas over this seems like an excessive punishment. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing health.\n\nAnother angle: cultural expectations. In some families, not passing the baby around might be seen as distancing or being cold. But the parents explained it's about the baby's comfort and health. If the family couldn't respect that, maybe they're not being supportive. The key here is the parents' right to make medical decisions for their child. Unless there's a cultural or family norm that's being violated without cause, the parents are in the right.\n\nIs there any nuance I'm missing? Maybe the family felt slighted because they see such precautions as unnecessary. However, the parents' stance is to protect their child, which is a parent's primary responsibility. The family's reaction seems to prioritize their feelings over the health of the newborn. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
