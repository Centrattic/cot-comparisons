We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The parents made an announcement saying they wouldn't pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources say 37-38 weeks might still be considered early. However, medically, full-term is 39 weeks. So the baby might be slightly preterm, which could make immunizations and health a concern. Flu season is a valid reason to limit exposure, especially for a newborn. Parents usually have the right to make decisions about their child's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel slighted because they expected to hold the baby. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to visit, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction of threatening to not come to Christmas seems harsh. The parents are prioritizing the baby's safety, which is a common concern.\n\nI think the key points are the health and safety justification and the polite communication. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. The family's overreaction is more on them. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
