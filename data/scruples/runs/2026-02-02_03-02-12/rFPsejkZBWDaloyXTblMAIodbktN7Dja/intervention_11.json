We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born at 37 weeks. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered full term, but maybe the parents are cautious because of flu season. They wanted to avoid overstimulation and potential illness for the baby. The message they sent was polite and clear, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh. \n\nI think the parents are just being responsible. Newborns have delicate immune systems, and flu season is a valid concern. Overstimulation can also affect the baby's health. The family might not understand the medical reasoning, but the parents have the right to make decisions for their child's well-being. \n\nThe question is whether they are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants confirmation. \n\nConsidering all that, the parents made a reasonable decision. They communicated it respectfully. The family's threat about Christmas seems disproportionate. So the answer should be B.\n"
