      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and there's a tension about not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely preterm. The parents wanted to protect the baby from flu season, so they decided not to let the family pass the baby around. They sent a message explaining this, but it caused offense. The family responded by saying they should probably not come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the parents) are in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break it down. The parents have a legitimate reason: flu season and the baby's health. A 37-week baby is still considered preterm, so their immune system might be weaker. Over-stimulation is also a concern for newborns. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to visit otherwise.\n\nOn the other hand, the family felt offended. Maybe they didn't expect such a clear boundary, especially around a family event like Christmas. Cultural expectations might play a role here. Some families might see passing the baby as a tradition, and not allowing it could be seen as exclusionary or dismissive. But the parents' priority is the baby's well-being.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could have suggested a safer way for the family to interact, like being in the same room without holding the baby, or using hand sanitizer. But the parents did invite them over to hang out with the baby in their presence. So maybe they did make an effort.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They had a valid reason, communicated it politely, and offered an alternative. The family's reaction seems overly harsh. The parents should prioritize their baby's health. So the answer is B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
