We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, which was born at 37 weeks. The family became upset and even threatened to exclude them from Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term. Wait, but the user mentioned \"barely full term.\" Hmm, 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources might consider 39 weeks as full-term. Maybe that's a point of confusion. However, even if it's full-term, the parents still have the right to set boundaries for their child's health, especially during flu season.\n\nThe parents' message was about not passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risk. They invited the family to come over and hang out. The family took offense and reacted strongly. From a parental perspective, protecting a newborn's health is a top priority. Flu season can be dangerous for infants, so avoiding contact with many people is reasonable. Also, overstimulation can be tiring for a newborn, so limiting handling might be necessary.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. It's their choice whether to attend Christmas, but threatening to exclude the parents over health precautions seems extreme. Parents setting boundaries for their child's well-being should be respected. The parents didn't say no to visitors entirely, just not passing the baby around. The family's response might indicate they didn't understand the importance of these precautions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's cultural or family expectations involved. Some families might expect to hold a new baby, and not allowing that could be seen as a slight. But in this case, the parents clearly communicated their reasons, which are valid for the baby's health. The family should respect that, even if they're disappointed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are not in the wrong. They prioritized their baby's health and safety, which is a responsible decision. The family's reaction was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
