We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about not letting their family pass around their newborn is in the wrong. The situation is that the baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents decided not to let the family pass the baby around during a Christmas gathering, citing flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family reacted by saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasons. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but technically slightly early. However, the parents might still be cautious, especially during flu season. The flu can be particularly dangerous for newborns, so their concern about germs is valid. Also, overstimulation is a real issue for newborns, as their nervous systems are still developing. Too much handling and stimuli can stress them out.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in a polite way, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. The family's reaction seems harsh, cutting off Christmas plans because of this. It's possible the family felt slighted or didn't take into account the parents' health concerns. \n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong, B says they're not. The key factors here are the parents' legitimate health concerns, their clear communication, and the family's overreaction. The parents aren't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing the baby's well-being. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas seems excessive and dismissive of the parents' valid reasons. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
