We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that their son was born 37 weeks, which is considered barely full term. They wanted to limit handling the baby because of flu season and didn't want the baby overstimulated. They told their family this via a message, and it caused a big rift, with the family threatening not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are reasonable. 37 weeks is considered early, but it's still full term according to the medical definition, which is 37-42 weeks. However, some sources might say that 39 weeks is considered full term. So, there's some nuance here. But regardless, the parents are concerned about the baby's health and flu season. That seems like a valid concern. Flu season can be dangerous for newborns, especially if they have underdeveloped immune systems. So, not wanting to have too many people handling the baby is a common precaution.\n\nThe author's message says they're open to the family coming over but just not passing the baby around. They mention not wanting him overstimulated and flu concerns. It sounds like they're trying to balance family interaction with the baby's needs. The family took offense, which could stem from feeling excluded or not being considered in the plans. But the parents are the ones responsible for the baby's health, so their decision should be respected.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? Maybe. In some families, not allowing the baby to be passed around might be seen as dismissive or untrustworthy. But the parents have a valid reason. The key point is whether the parents' decision is reasonable. Given the context of flu season and the baby's health, it's reasonable. The family's reaction is harsh, but the parents aren't wrong for prioritizing their child's well-being. The text they sent was polite and explained the reasons, so they tried to be considerate.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made a responsible decision for their baby's health and communicated it clearly, even if the family didn't take it well.\n"
