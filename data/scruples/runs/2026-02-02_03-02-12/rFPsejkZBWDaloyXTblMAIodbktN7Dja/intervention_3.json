We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, so 37 weeks. The parents sent a message saying they don't want to pass the baby around during Christmas because of flu season and overstimulation. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. A 37-week baby is still considered preterm, albeit close to full term. Preemies are more vulnerable to infections like the flu, which can be serious. So from a health perspective, the parents have a valid reason to protect the baby. They also mention overstimulation, which is common for newborns, especially in a busy family gathering.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are making a decision to protect their child's health and well-being. It's their responsibility as parents to set boundaries. The family might be feeling excluded or not involved, but that's not the parents' fault. The text the parents sent was polite and explained their reasons clearly. They invited the family over to hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. So the author is being considerate but firm.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? Maybe in some families, handling a newborn is a tradition, but the parents are prioritizing the baby's needs. The family's response of threatening to not attend Christmas because of this seems overly punitive. It's a serious consequence for a decision meant to protect an infant.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The parents have a legitimate concern for their child's health and are communicating their boundaries. The family is reacting negatively to these boundaries. The parents are not being unreasonable. They're making a responsible parenting choice. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
