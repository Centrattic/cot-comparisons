We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but slightly early. They told their family they wouldn't be passing the baby around on Christmas because they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They have a newborn, which is vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. Doctors often advise limiting visitors, especially in the first few months, to protect the baby's health. Also, newborns can get overstimulated by too much interaction, so it's common to want to keep them calm and comfortable. Their message seems polite and clear, explaining their reasons.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not attend Christmas because the parents want to protect their baby seems unwarranted. It's important to respect the parents' wishes when a child is involved, especially when there are medical considerations. The family's response might stem from feeling slighted, but their reaction is extreme.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some families, holding a baby is seen as a right, especially for relatives. However, the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The key here is whether the parents acted inconsiderately or if the family overreacted. The post's text is polite and invites the family to visit, just without passing the baby. That seems reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are making a reasonable decision for their baby's health and comfort. The family's response is disproportionate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
