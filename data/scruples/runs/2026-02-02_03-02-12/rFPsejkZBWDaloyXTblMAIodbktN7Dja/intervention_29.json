We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born 37 weeks early, which is technically full-term but maybe a bit early. The family was told they can't pass the baby around, and the text message they sent explains their reasoning: not wanting the baby overstimulated and flu season concerns. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. 37 weeks is considered full-term in some definitions, but some sources might consider it early term. However, flu season is a valid health concern. New parents might be cautious, especially if the baby is slightly premature. The parents are not keeping the baby entirely away but are allowing the family to visit and meet the baby, just not pass him around.\n\nThe key points are health and safety. Parents have the right to set boundaries to protect their child's health. Flu season is a real risk for infants, even if the baby is technically full-term. The parents' message was polite and explained their reasons, which should help others understand. The family's reaction seems harsh, as the parents are not being unreasonable. Allowing visitors to come over shows they're still including the family, just with a specific precaution. \n\nSo, the parents aren't wrong. They communicated their reasons clearly. The family's response of threatening to exclude them from Christmas is the problem here. The parents are acting in their child's best interest, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
