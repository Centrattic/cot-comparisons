We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family hold their nearly full-term newborn during Christmas. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but technically not premature, as full term is usually 37-42 weeks. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu exposure, so they informed the family beforehand. However, the family took offense and even threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they didn't comply.\n\nFirst, the parents' decision is based on health concerns. Even though 37 weeks is close to full term, babies born at this stage can still be more vulnerable to illnesses. The flu season is a valid concern, and protecting the baby's health is a responsible choice. Overstimulation is another valid reason, as newborns need time to adjust, and too much handling can be stressful for them.\n\nThe key issue here is communication. The parents did inform the family in advance, which is important. They also offered an alternative: the family can come over and hang out with the baby without passing him around. The text they sent was polite and explained their reasons clearly. The family's reaction seems overly harsh, as the parents are prioritizing the baby's well-being.\n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation that might be at play here? Sometimes, family traditions can clash with new parents' decisions. The line \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas\" indicates that the family might feel excluded or that their traditions are being ignored. However, the parents aren't preventing the family from attending; they just have specific boundaries for the baby's safety.\n\nThe parents aren't being unreasonable. They are setting clear, health-based boundaries. The family's response seems disproportionate, as they are penalizing the parents for wanting to protect their newborn. The parents' message was clear and respectful, so the blame shouldn't be on them. The family's threat is more indicative of their own inability to accommodate the parents' needs, rather than the parents being in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They made responsible decisions for their child's health and communicated them effectively. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' actions.\n"
