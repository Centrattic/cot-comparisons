We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The main points are about flu season and wanting to avoid overstimulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not allowing family to hold the baby is a reasonable precaution. 37 weeks is considered full term, but some sources say it's \"early term.\" However, most of the time, 37 weeks is still considered safe. The parents are concerned about flu season, which is a valid health concern. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so avoiding exposure to illness is a common practice. \n\nThe text they sent out seems polite and clear, explaining their reasons. They invited the family over but set a boundary about not passing the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to exclude them from Christmas if they do this. That's a strong response. It's possible the family misunderstood or felt slighted, but the parents' actions were to protect the baby's health.\n\nI should also think about cultural or family norms. Maybe in their culture, holding the newborn is a big deal, and the parents' refusal was seen as a slight. However, health concerns are generally respected. The parents are not being unreasonable here. The family's reaction is disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision for their child's well-being and communicated it clearly. The family overreacted. Answer B.\n"
