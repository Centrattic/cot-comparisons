We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term. However, some people might consider that \"barely full term\" and worry about health risks, especially in flu season. The parents communicated their decision in a polite way, explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. They invited the family to come over and hang out but not to pass the baby around.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. It's common for new parents to set boundaries to protect their baby's health. Flu season is a valid concern, and overstimulation is a common reason to limit interactions. The parents didn't say the family couldn't visit; they just limited physical contact with the baby. The family's response of cutting off Christmas plans seems disproportionate and hurtful.\n\nI think the parents had a legitimate reason to set this boundary. They communicated it politely and provided an alternative. The family's reaction suggests they might be more upset about not holding the baby than about the parents' decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
