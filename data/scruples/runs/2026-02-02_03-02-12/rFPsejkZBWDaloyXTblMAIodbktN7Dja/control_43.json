We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, which was born 3 weeks early (37 weeks). The family was upset, and the author's message was about avoiding over-stimulation and flu risks. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources might say 37-38 weeks is \"early term.\" However, even if it's considered full-term, the parents are concerned about flu season. Flu can be dangerous for newborns, leading to complications. So from a health perspective, the parents have a valid reason to limit exposure.\n\nThe family took offense and said if that's the case, maybe they shouldn't come to Christmas. The author's message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are making a decision for their child's health, which is a common practice. It's similar to how people avoid crowds for newborns to prevent illness.\n\nHowever, the family might feel excluded or think the parents are being overly cautious. But given the flu risk, the parents' decision is reasonable. The message was clear and offered an alternative (visiting but not passing the baby around), which is respectful. The family's response seems to be more about feeling offended rather than addressing the health concern.\n\nIn terms of social norms, parents often set boundaries for their children's well-being. So the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
