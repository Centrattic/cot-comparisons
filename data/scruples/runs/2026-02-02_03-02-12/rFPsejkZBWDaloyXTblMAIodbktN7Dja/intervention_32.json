We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about a family not allowing people to pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season and not wanting to overstimulate the baby. The family reacted strongly, saying if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical facts. A 37-week pregnancy is considered late preterm. These babies can have health risks compared to full-term babies, like breathing issues, feeding problems, and higher susceptibility to infections. Flu season is a valid concern here. So medically, the parents are justified in being cautious.\n\nSocially, families often have traditions, but the parents are setting boundaries for their child's health. The message the author sent was polite and explained the reasons. They invited the family over, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's their choice to exclude others, but the parents had a legitimate reason. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the reasoning, the parents are protecting their child's health, which is a valid reason. The family's response was overreacting. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
