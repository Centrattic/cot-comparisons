We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask an AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing their family to hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby is at 37 weeks, which is technically considered full-term, but some sources say 39 weeks is considered full. However, the parents wanted to be cautious due to flu season and decided not to pass the baby around. Their message was intended to be polite and set boundaries, but the family took it as an insult, leading to a Christmas conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term but might still be at higher risk for certain issues compared to a baby born at 39 weeks. However, the main reason the parents gave was flu season. Flu can be dangerous for newborns, so precautions like limiting exposure make sense. The parents' message was clear and offered an alternative (family can come over to hang out), which seems reasonable.\n\nNext, the family's reaction seems disproportionate. The parents didn't say \"no\" to family interaction; they just wanted to avoid passing the baby around. It's possible the family felt snubbed or that the parents were being too controlling. But the parents had a legitimate health concern. The family's response of cutting off Christmas ties over this seems harsh.\n\nThe parents' message was polite and provided context, which is key in such situations. They weren't being inconsiderate; they were prioritizing the baby's health. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or hurt feelings, but the parents had a valid reason. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
