We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The family was upset and threatened to not invite them to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks, so 37 weeks is considered early term. Babies born at 37 weeks are still at higher risk for certain complications compared to full-term. Flu season is a concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months old, and they're more vulnerable to infections. So the parents' caution might be medically sound.\n\nNext, the parents' message was clear: they wanted to prevent overstimulation and flu risk. They invited the family to hang out but not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not attend Christmas because of health precautions might be an overreaction. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is a common concern.\n\nHowever, cultural or family expectations might play a role. Some families might see not passing the baby as rude or ungrateful. But health concerns are a valid reason, especially with a preterm baby. The parents didn't outright refuse visitors, just the passing. The family's response seems disproportionate.\n\nPossible angles: The parents did communicate their reasons, so they're not being unreasonable. The family's threat is harsh. On the other hand, maybe the parents could have been more accommodating, like allowing hand sanitizing or limiting contact. But they did compromise by allowing visits. \n\nIn similar situations, people often side with the parents when health is a legitimate concern. The threat to exclude them from Christmas over this seems extreme. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not the Asshole).\n"
