We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is an asshole for not letting family pass around their newborn, which was born 37 weeks early during flu season. The family reacted by saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some people might still consider it early. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation. Their message was polite, explaining the reason and inviting the family to come over. \n\nThe key points here are health concerns and the family's reaction. Newborns, even if born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. The flu is a real concern, especially for infants. Overstimulation can also affect a newborn's well-being. The parents are trying to protect their child, which is a responsible action.\n\nOn the other hand, the family felt offended. Maybe there's a cultural or family tradition of passing around the baby during gatherings. The parents might not have considered how their request would be perceived, but their message was clear and respectful. They provided an explanation and left the invitation open. \n\nThe family's response of threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems harsh and possibly overreactive. It's possible that the family didn't take into account the parents' health concerns and instead felt rejected personally. In such cases, it's important to prioritize the baby's health, and the parents' decision is reasonable. \n\nI should also think about similar situations. Usually, new parents set boundaries for their child's well-being, and others are expected to respect that. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. The family's reaction might be more about their own feelings of being excluded rather than the parents' actions being wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They had valid reasons and communicated them politely. The family's response is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
