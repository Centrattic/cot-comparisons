      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is the asshole (AITA) for not letting their family pass around their 37-week-old newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, so 37 weeks is still considered full term, but maybe borderline. The parents wanted to be safe due to flu season and let the family know they wouldn't be passing the baby around. The family got offended and even said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nThe text the author sent says they're not passing the baby around but invites the family to come hang out. They mention not wanting the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. They have a medical concern\u2014flu season is risky for newborns. Even if the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some places but maybe still early for others. The parents are trying to protect their child's health. On the other hand, the family might feel excluded or not respected. The parents set boundaries, but maybe the way they communicated it was off-putting?\n\nWait, the parents did invite the family over and said they could hang out with the baby, just not pass him around. So they allowed visiting but with restrictions. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to exclude them from Christmas. Maybe the parents are in the right because they have a legitimate health concern. However, the way the message was phrased could come off as dismissive. Let me check the exact text again: \"We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today.\" It's polite, but maybe the family still felt miffed. \n\nIn similar situations, people often get upset when their loved ones set boundaries, even reasonable ones. The parents are prioritizing their child's health, which is a valid concern. The family's reaction seems over the top. So, the answer is likely B\u2014author is not in the wrong. They did communicate their decision and still invited family over, just with limitations. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas is the real issue here. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. Unless there was prior tension, the parents are justified.\n"
