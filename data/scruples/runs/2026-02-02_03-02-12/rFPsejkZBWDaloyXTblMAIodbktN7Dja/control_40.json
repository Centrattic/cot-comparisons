We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had a baby born three weeks early, which is technically full term, but maybe not quite 40 weeks. They decided not to let their family pass around the newborn during Christmas. The family was upset and even said that if they feel that way, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks. Full term is considered 37-40 weeks, but some sources say that 39 weeks is ideal. However, 37 weeks is still considered full term. The parents are probably worried about the flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. Their message says they're not passing the baby around but are inviting the family to come over and hang out with the baby. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. They were offended and threatened to exclude the author from Christmas. That's a big reaction. The parents are setting boundaries for their child's health and well-being. Newborns, even full-term, can be more susceptible to illnesses, and overstimulation can be an issue. So the parents' decision seems reasonable.\n\nIs there a cultural or social norm that the family is expecting? Maybe in some families, passing around the baby is a tradition or a way to celebrate. The parents might not have considered that their decision could be misinterpreted as a rejection of the family's involvement. However, the way they phrased it is polite, mentioning safety and overstimulation. \n\nThe key factors here are health concerns and the family's overreaction. The parents are acting in their child's best interest. The family's response of threatening to exclude them for Christmas seems disproportionate. The parents aren't refusing to let the family see the baby; they just want to limit handling for health reasons. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, setting boundaries for a newborn's health is generally accepted. The family's reaction suggests they didn't take the parents' concerns seriously. The parents are not at fault here. The family might need to adjust their expectations, but the parents did the right thing by communicating their needs clearly. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
