We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family was upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's how they feel. The author sent a message explaining their decision due to overstimulation and flu season concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but slightly early. The parents wanted to avoid passing the baby around, likely to protect his health. Flu season is a valid concern, as newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. Overstimulation is another valid reason; newborns need a lot of rest, and too much handling can be stressful for them.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this decision is extreme. The parents' message was polite and offered an alternative (coming over to hang out), which suggests they still wanted to spend time with family. The family's response indicates they felt offended, but the parents didn't deny them interaction entirely\u2014just handling the baby. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they made a reasonable decision based on the baby's health and well-being. The family overreacted. The parents didn't act out of malice but out of concern for their child. The text was a heads-up, not a rejection of the family. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
