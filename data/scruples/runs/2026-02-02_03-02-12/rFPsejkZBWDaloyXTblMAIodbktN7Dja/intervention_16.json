We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The author sent a message explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks, but the family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is considered preterm by some standards. Flu season can be a real concern for infants, especially if they're not fully developed yet. Their decision to limit handling might be to protect the baby's health. The message was clear and polite, giving an explanation and inviting family over. So their intentions seem reasonable.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they wanted to protect their child feels like an overreaction. It's important to respect parents' decisions regarding their newborn's health. New parents often have rules about who can hold the baby, especially if there are health concerns. The family might be feeling excluded, but that's not the parents' fault. \n\nIs there any way the parents could have been in the wrong? Maybe if they didn't give a clear reason or were dismissive, but they provided a valid health concern. The key here is that they're prioritizing the baby's well-being. The family should understand that. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B\u2014author is not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision for their child's health and communicated it politely. The family's response was unkind and unnecessary.\n"
