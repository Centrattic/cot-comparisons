We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The family got offended and the author is now being questioned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born three weeks early, which is 37 weeks. While 37 weeks is considered full term by some definitions, others might still see it as early. The parents wanted to avoid passing the baby around due to flu season concerns. Their message was polite, explaining they wanted to keep the baby from being overstimulated and worried about the flu. They invited the family over to hang out with the baby.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's health and safety. Even if the baby is considered full term, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. Flu season is a real concern, and preventing the spread of illness is responsible. Overstimulation is another valid reason for new parents to limit handling of a newborn.\n\nThe family's reaction seems excessive. The author's message was clear and offered an alternative. If the family felt offended, maybe it's because they had different expectations, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing the baby's well-being. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They communicated their wishes politely and provided an option to be present. The family's response of cutting Christmas ties seems unreasonable given the circumstances.\n"
