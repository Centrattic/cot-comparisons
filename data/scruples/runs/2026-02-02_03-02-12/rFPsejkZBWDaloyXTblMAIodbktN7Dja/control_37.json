      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn son born at 37 weeks, which is considered early. The family's reaction was to say they won't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The baby was born three weeks early, which is 37 weeks. While full term is typically considered 39-40 weeks, 37 weeks is still considered full term in some definitions, but some doctors might see it as early. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and the flu season. They sent a message beforehand not to pass the baby around, and the family took offense, leading to a threat about not coming to Christmas.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is about safety and the baby's well-being. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be fragile. Flu season is a real concern, as viruses can be serious for infants. Overstimulation is also a valid concern because newborns need time to adjust and parents want to avoid stress.\n\nHowever, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents communicated their decision in advance, so the family had a chance to prepare or understand. The message was polite, stating it's to protect the baby, not to exclude anyone. The threat of not coming to Christmas is a strong response to a health precaution. \n\nIn many cultures, family gatherings with newborns are common, and the parents are within their rights to set boundaries for their child's safety. The fact that the parents allowed family to come over and interact with the baby without passing him around might have been misinterpreted. Maybe the family felt excluded or that they weren't trusted, leading to offense. \n\nBut is the parent the asshole here? It seems like they're prioritizing their child's health, which is a common-sense approach. Unless there was a prior expectation that the baby must be passed around, which wasn't mentioned, the parents aren't in the wrong. The family's reaction appears to be overstepping. So the answer is B.\n"
