      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, considered early, and they decided not to let their family pass around the newborn during a visit. The family took offense and mentioned they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born three weeks early, which is at 37 weeks. Full term is typically considered 39-40 weeks, so 37 is early, but not extremely preterm. However, even 37 weeks can have some risks compared to full-term. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation, so they set a boundary. The family was upset and took it as a personal slight, leading to a Christmas threat.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me consider both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's side: They have a reason to be cautious. A newborn's immune system isn't fully developed, and even if the baby is healthy, flu is contagious. The parents are making a responsible choice to protect their child. Also, 37 weeks is early, so maybe the baby is more vulnerable. The message was clear and polite, they offered the family to come over and hang out but not pass the baby around. They explained their reasons, which are health-related, so it's not just a personal preference but a protective measure.\n\nFrom the family's side: They might feel excluded or that the parents are being overly cautious. Family traditions can include passing around the baby, and not allowing that might feel like a rejection. However, the parents are not refusing to see them; they just set a boundary around handling the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to exclude them from Christmas for a health-related decision. That's a strong response to a reasonable request.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, when a family has a new baby, visitors are often restricted to protect the infant's health. Especially during flu season, asking people not to touch the baby is common. The parents are communicating this in advance, which is thoughtful. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing the baby's well-being. The family might be projecting their own feelings about being excluded rather than respecting the parents' decision for the baby's health.\n\nAlso, 37 weeks is considered early term, and there can be complications. Even if the baby is healthy, the parents are justified in erring on the side of caution. The key here is that the author is making a health-based decision, not a social one. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas is a serious overreaction. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries to protect their child. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
