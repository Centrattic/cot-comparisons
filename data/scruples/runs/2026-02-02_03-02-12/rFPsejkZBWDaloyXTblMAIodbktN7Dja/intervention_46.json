We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The key points here are that the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but still early. The parents wanted to be safe during flu season and communicated their decision in advance. The family took offense, leading to a Christmas conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. A 37-week baby is technically full-term, but preemies can have more health risks. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old. The parents are trying to protect their baby, which is a common-sense precaution. However, the way they communicated it might have come off as excluding the family, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nThe author's message was polite and offered an alternative\u2014inviting the family to visit instead of passing the baby around. They mentioned not wanting over-stimulation and flu concerns. It seems reasonable. But the family reacted strongly, saying they shouldn't come to Christmas. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they had a legitimate health concern and tried to set boundaries respectfully. The family's overreaction is more on their side. The parents shouldn't be forced to let people hold the baby if they're worried about health. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a responsible decision to protect their child. The family's response was disproportionate. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
