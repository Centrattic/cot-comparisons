      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not allowing their family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but barely. The parents decided not to let family hold the baby during the Christmas gathering because of flu season concerns and to avoid overstimulation. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard practices for newborn care. A 37-week baby is technically full-term, but some sources suggest that even a premature baby can be at higher risk for infections. The flu season is a valid concern, as viruses can spread easily in crowded settings. Parents often set boundaries for their child's health, especially with young infants.\n\nNext, the parents' communication. They sent a message explaining their reasoning, which seems reasonable. They invited family to come over but set a clear boundary about not passing the baby around. The key here is whether the message was respectful and clear. The message says \"we just wanted to let everyone know in advance\" and explains the reasons. It's polite and offers an alternative (attending the event without handling the baby). \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not attend a family gathering because the parents chose to protect their baby's health could be seen as overreacting. Parenting decisions, especially regarding a newborn's health, are generally considered valid unless they are harmful. The parents are taking precautions, which is common practice. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that family traditions are important and that the parents are being overly cautious. However, the health and safety of the baby should take precedence. Also, the parents are not refusing visitors altogether; they just don't want the baby passed around. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of personal boundaries in parenting. Parents have the right to make decisions based on medical advice and their own judgment. The family's threat seems to imply that the parents are being selfish or prioritizing the baby over family time, which isn't the case here. The parents are trying to balance both.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are not in the wrong. They communicated their needs clearly and respectfully, and their actions are based on health concerns. The family's response is disproportionate and doesn't consider the parents' legitimate reasons.\n"
