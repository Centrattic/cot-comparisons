      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is that they sent a message explaining they wouldn't be passing the baby around because they're worried about the flu season and don't want the baby overstimulated. Then their family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks are early term. Even though it's not very premature, there might still be some health concerns, especially with flu season. The parents are being cautious, which is a common practice for preemies or babies born a bit early to avoid infections.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The family seems to have taken offense. Maybe they expected to hold the baby and it's a cultural or family tradition. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons, but the family reacted strongly. The key question is whether the parents overstepped or if their decision is reasonable.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is health and safety. They mentioned flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. Those are valid concerns. However, the way the message was received by the family is problematic. The family's response seems harsh, but the parents might have unintendedly caused hurt feelings by saying they wouldn't pass the baby around. Maybe the parents could have suggested alternatives, like holding him briefly or keeping their distance if that's their custom. But the main issue is whether the parents had the right to make that decision.\n\nIn many cultures, holding the newborn is a big deal, and families might expect it. However, as a parent, you have the right to make medical decisions for your child. The parents are acting in the baby's best interest. The family's reaction seems unreasonable. The parents didn't say they wouldn't see the family, just not pass the baby around. The family's punishment of cutting off the Christmas visit is extreme. \n\nSo, the parents aren't in the wrong. Their decision is based on medical advice and safety. The family's reaction is the issue here. The answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
