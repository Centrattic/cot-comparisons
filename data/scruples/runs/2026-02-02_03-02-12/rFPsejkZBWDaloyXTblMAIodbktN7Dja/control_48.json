We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely preterm. The parents sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around due to flu season concerns and overstimulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Newborns, especially preterm, are more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern, and protecting the baby's health is a priority. The parents clearly communicated their decision in a polite way, inviting family to come over but setting a boundary. \n\nThe family's reaction was harsh, threatening to not come to Christmas. That's a strong response. The parents were trying to be cautious, which is reasonable. They didn't say the family couldn't visit; they just didn't want the baby passed around. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child. The request seems reasonable. The family's reaction is more about feeling slighted than any actual wrongdoing by the parents. The parents didn't say no to visiting, just set a specific boundary. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their needs clearly and with good intentions. The family's overreaction is on them, not the parents. The parents are acting in their child's best interest, which is a valid reason.\n"
