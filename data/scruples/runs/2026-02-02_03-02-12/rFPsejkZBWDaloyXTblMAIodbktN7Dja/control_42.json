      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, which was born 37 weeks early. The family reacted strongly by saying not to come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born three weeks early, so 37 weeks. That's considered a full term, but sometimes 37 weeks can have some risks compared to 40 weeks. The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu, so they decided not to let family pass the baby around. The family was upset and took it as a personal offense, leading to a threat to exclude them from Christmas.\n\nThe key points here are the health and safety of the baby versus the family's feelings. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is a common concern, especially with newborns and flu season. However, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents' message was polite and offered an alternative (coming over to hang out), which shows they weren't excluding the family entirely, just limiting the baby's handling.\n\nIn similar situations, it's common for parents to set boundaries for their child's safety. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so avoiding too many people and potential germs is standard advice. The fact that the baby was born early (even though 37 weeks is technically full term) might add a layer of concern for the parents, even if others don't see it that way.\n\nThe family's response seems proportionate? They might feel slighted, but the parents' decision is for a valid reason. The question is whether the parents are wrong for setting this boundary. The answer would likely be no, as protecting the baby's health is reasonable. The family's overreaction is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are justified in their decision to limit handling of the newborn for health reasons, and the family's response is overly harsh and not acceptable.\n"
