We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass their newborn. The baby was born 37 weeks, which is technically full term, but the parents wanted to be cautious during flu season. They communicated their decision in a polite way, saying the family could visit but not pass the baby around. The family reacted strongly, even mentioning not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nHmm, first, 37 weeks is considered full term, right? So maybe the family's concern is about a premature baby. But the parents mentioned it's flu season, which is a valid health concern. Newborns are more vulnerable to illnesses, so limiting contact to protect the baby makes sense. The parents clearly stated their reasons and invited the family over. \n\nThe family's reaction seems over the top. The parents didn't say no to visits, just no to passing the baby around. Maybe the family felt excluded or that the parents are being too controlling. But from a health perspective, the parents have a right to set boundaries. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing? The parents communicated their decision respectfully and provided a valid reason. They didn't prevent the family from seeing the baby, just from passing him around. The family's threat about Christmas seems like a disproportionate response. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
