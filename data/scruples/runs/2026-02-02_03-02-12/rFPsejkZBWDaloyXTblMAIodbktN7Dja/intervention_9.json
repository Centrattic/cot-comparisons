We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born a few weeks early. The situation is during flu season, and the author sent a message explaining that they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. The family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but maybe the parents still want to be cautious. Flu season is a valid concern because young infants can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, and they're more vulnerable to infections. Overstimulation is another valid point because newborns can get overwhelmed by too many people or too much activity.\n\nThe message the author sent was polite and explained their reasons. They invited the family to come over, so it's not like they were excluding them entirely. They just wanted to set boundaries for the baby's well-being. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to not come to Christmas over a health precaution. That seems disproportionate.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. Some families might expect to hold newborns during gatherings, but the parents have the right to make decisions about their child's health. It's their responsibility to protect the baby, especially from potential illnesses. The family members might not realize how serious the risk is, especially with the flu. The author's message was clear and offered an alternative, so they're not being unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the family felt slighted because they wanted to hold the baby and thought the parents were being overly cautious. But the parents' decision is based on health reasons, which should take precedence. The threat to exclude them from Christmas seems like an overreaction. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's health and safety. They communicated their decision respectfully, so there's no intentional harm done.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's response is more about their own feelings of being excluded rather than the parents making a responsible decision. The answer should be B.\n"
