We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to keep the baby safe. The family was upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Premature babies, even if they're 37 weeks old, might have weaker immune systems compared to full-term babies. Flu season is a real concern because viruses can be more dangerous for infants. The parents are trying to protect their child, which is a common-sense approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the family feels offended. Maybe they didn't realize the severity of the situation or thought it's a way for the parents to avoid interaction. The message the parents sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family over but set boundaries to prevent overstimulation and health risks.\n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation that might be conflicting here? Sometimes families expect to hold newborns, especially during holidays. However, the parents' priority is the baby's well-being. The family's reaction seems a bit extreme, but maybe they felt excluded. However, the parents aren't denying interaction entirely; they just want to keep the baby safe.\n\nI think the key points are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus the family's expectations. Since the parents communicated their reasons clearly and offered an alternative (visiting without handling the baby), they aren't being unreasonable. The family's response seems harsh because they're prioritizing their feelings over the baby's health. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're acting in their child's best interest, and their communication was respectful. The family should understand and respect that decision, even if they're disappointed.\n"
