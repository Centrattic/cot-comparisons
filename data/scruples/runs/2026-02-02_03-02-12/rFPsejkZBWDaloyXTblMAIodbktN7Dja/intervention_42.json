We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born just before 37 weeks. The situation is during flu season, and the family got offended, leading to a Christmas conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born 3 weeks early but at 37 weeks. Medically, a full-term pregnancy is considered from 37 to 42 weeks. So 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some might still consider it early. However, the parents' main concern is about flu season and not wanting to overstimulate the baby. Their message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are trying to protect their newborn's health and well-being, which is a common concern. It's not uncommon for new parents to set boundaries with visitors, especially with a preterm or early-term baby. The text message was friendly and offered an alternative (people can come over and hang out), so it's not like they were excluding everyone. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The parents have valid reasons, and the family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems overreactive. The key points here are the health of the baby, communication of the reasons, and the offer to still have interactions. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
