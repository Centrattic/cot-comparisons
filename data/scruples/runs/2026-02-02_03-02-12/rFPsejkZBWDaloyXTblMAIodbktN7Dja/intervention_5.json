We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn son born at 37 weeks. The situation is during flu season, and they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the reasoning. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, right? But some sources say that 37 weeks is still a bit early, maybe considered \"late preterm.\" These babies can sometimes have more health risks compared to 39-40 weeks. So the parents might have valid medical concerns about flu exposure. \n\nThe parents sent a message explaining their reasons: not passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risk. They invited the family to hang out. The family took offense and mentioned the Christmas event. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting these boundaries? Well, as a parent, you want to protect your newborn. Flu season is a real concern, especially for infants who can't get the flu shot until six months. The parents are making a health decision for their child. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. They were invited but chose to take it personally. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their baby's health. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason and communicated it in advance. The family's response is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
