We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that their son was born 37 weeks early, which is considered \"barely full term\" but still technically full term, right? They wanted to protect the baby from the flu during the holidays and decided not to let family members pass him around. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is still a preterm birth, and even though some sources might say 37-38 weeks are considered term now, there can still be risks for the baby's immune system. Flu season is a real concern. So the parents have valid reasons for being cautious. They didn't say the family couldn't come over; they just didn't want the baby passed around. That seems reasonable.\n\nThen, the way the message was phrased: they said family could come over and hang out, just not pass the baby. They mentioned over-stimulation and flu concerns. It sounds like they're trying to be polite and set boundaries for the baby's health. But the family reacted strongly, threatening to not come to Christmas. That seems like an overreaction. Families can be sensitive about their children, so maybe they felt excluded or not trusted with handling the baby safely.\n\nBut the parents' main goal is to protect the baby. They had a right to set those boundaries. The family's response was harsh, cutting off holiday plans over this. The parents probably didn't mean to offend, but they had legitimate reasons. So the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. They didn't do anything to deserve the family's reaction. The family might be overreacting, but the author's actions were justified.\n"
