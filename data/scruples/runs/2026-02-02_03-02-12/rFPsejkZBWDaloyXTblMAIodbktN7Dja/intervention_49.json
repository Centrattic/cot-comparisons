We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents decided not to let their family pass around the baby because of flu season. They sent a message explaining that they didn't want the baby overstimulated and were worried about the flu. The family got offended and threatened not to come to Christmas if they did that. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the health aspect. 37 weeks is technically full term, but it's still early, and preemies can be more vulnerable to infections. Flu season is a real concern. So the parents are trying to protect the baby's health. That seems reasonable. On the other hand, the family might feel excluded or like they're being treated differently. But isn't it the parents' right to make decisions about their baby's care? They're the main caregivers, so they should have the final say, even if others are upset.\n\nThe message the author sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out with the baby, but just not to pass him around. The family's reaction seems harsh. They're making a big deal about it and threatening to not come to Christmas, which is a major holiday. That seems like an overreaction. The parents are setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a responsible action. The family might not understand the medical reasons, but that doesn't make the parents wrong for making those decisions.\n\nAlso, cultural factors might play a role. In some families, sharing the baby is a big part of celebrations, and not allowing that could be seen as a slight. However, the parents' health concerns should take precedence. It's a balance between family traditions and medical advice. Since the parents are acting on medical advice (flu season, preterm baby), they're doing what's best for the baby. The family's reaction seems to be more about their own feelings than the baby's well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision to protect their newborn's health, communicated politely. The family overreacted. Answer B.\n"
