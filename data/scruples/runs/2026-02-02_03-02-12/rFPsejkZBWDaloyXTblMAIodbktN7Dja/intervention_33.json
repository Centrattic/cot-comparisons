We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering, citing concerns about over-stimulation and flu season. The family was upset and even threatened to not come to Christmas. The parents are asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is considered a late preterm birth. These babies can be more vulnerable to infections compared to full-term babies, which are born at 39-40 weeks. Flu season is a real concern because young infants, especially those born early, have underdeveloped immune systems. So, from a health perspective, the parents' decision makes sense. They're trying to protect their child from potential illness.\n\nNext, the family's reaction. They felt offended and were upset enough to mention not attending Christmas. That's pretty serious. The parents did send a message in advance, explaining their reasoning. The message was polite, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and explaining their decision. They even invited the family to come over to hang out. So they weren't completely excluding them, just setting a boundary about the baby.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. Family gatherings can be emotional, and people might overreact when they feel excluded, especially when it's about a new baby. However, the parents were clear and respectful in their communication. They had a valid reason based on health concerns. It's possible the family felt slighted not because of the decision itself, but because they might have expected to hold the baby. But the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes people don't take health precautions seriously. The family might have felt that the risk of flu isn't a big deal or that they can handle it. But the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. The family's threat to avoid Christmas seems harsh, but maybe they were hurt or didn't consider the parents' perspective.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, not allowing family to hold a baby might be seen as disrespectful or cold. However, the parents' main concern is the baby's health. The message was upfront and included an invitation to visit, so it's not like they're keeping the baby hidden.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents made a reasonable decision to protect their fragile newborn. They communicated this clearly and politely. The family's reaction seems overblown given the circumstances. Therefore, the parents aren't in the wrong.\n"
