We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The author's message was about keeping the baby safe during flu season and avoiding overstimulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources say that babies born even a few weeks early can have slightly higher risks, especially in terms of immunity. Flu season is a real concern here. So, the parents are trying to protect their child, which seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. They might have felt excluded or that their traditions were being disregarded. But the parents are prioritizing the baby's health. The message the author sent was polite, explaining the reasons and inviting the family to come over otherwise. That seems considerate. \n\nHowever, maybe the family had different expectations. They might have felt that not allowing the baby to be passed around was a slight, even if the parents had valid reasons. But is the author at fault here? The key points are: the baby's health, flu season, and clear communication. The parents made their reasoning known in advance. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in their child's best interest, and they communicated their decision respectfully. The family's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
