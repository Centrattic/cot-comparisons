We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The situation is that the parents wanted to be safe during flu season and communicated their decision, but the family was offended and even threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but being three weeks early might still make the baby more vulnerable to illnesses compared to a full-term baby. So the parents' concern about the flu is valid. It's common for new parents to set boundaries to protect their newborn's health, especially in the first few months.\n\nNext, the communication. The parents sent a message explaining their reasons\u2014avoiding overstimulation and flu risk. They also invited the family to come over and hang out. The problem seems to stem from the family's reaction. Offending the entire family and threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems harsh. The parents were clear and polite in their message. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, which makes sense. The key points are the parents' right to prioritize their baby's health and their clear communication. The family's overreaction suggests they might be in the wrong for not respecting the parents' decision and reacting with hostility. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
