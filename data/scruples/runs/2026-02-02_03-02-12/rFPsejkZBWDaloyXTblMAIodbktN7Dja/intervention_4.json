We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong when they decided not to let their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is during flu season, and the author sent a message explaining their decision to avoid overstimulating the baby and to prevent potential illness. However, the family reacted negatively, even threatening to not come to Christmas if they couldn't pass the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but the author mentions being \"barely full term.\" There's a common understanding that preterm or early-term babies may have more fragile health, so taking precautions makes sense. Flu season is a real concern, as newborns can't get vaccinated and are vulnerable to severe illness. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for newborns, as they need a lot of rest and quiet time to adjust.\n\nThe author's message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family over to meet the baby. They didn't refuse the visit entirely but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems over-the-top. Threatening to not come to Christmas because they can't hold the baby is harsh. It's understandable that family might be disappointed, but the author's priority is the baby's health and well-being, which is a parent's right.\n\nHowever, maybe the family didn't take the message well because they felt excluded or that their request wasn't respected. The line \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas\" suggests a misunderstanding or a lack of empathy. The author isn't being inconsiderate by setting boundaries for their child's safety. \n\nIn similar situations, it's generally accepted that parents have the final say in decisions regarding their child's health. The author's actions are responsible and protective. The family's response seems to prioritize their own desires over the baby's needs. So the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
