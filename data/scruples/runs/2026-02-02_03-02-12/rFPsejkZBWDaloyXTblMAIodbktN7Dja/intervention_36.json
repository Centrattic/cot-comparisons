      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is technically full term but maybe considered \"barely full term\" depending on definitions. The parents wanted to avoid the baby being overstimulated and worried about the flu during the visit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical advice. Newborns, especially those born even just a week or two early, are still vulnerable. Their immune systems aren't fully developed, so exposure to a lot of people, especially during flu season, could be risky. Doctors often advise against too much handling of newborns in the first few weeks to prevent infections and overstimulation. So from a health perspective, the parents' decision seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The parents mentioned they're open to the family coming over to hang out, just not passing the baby around. But the family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas. That seems harsh. The parents are setting boundaries for the baby's health and well-being. It's their right to protect their child, especially if they have valid medical reasons.\n\nThe way the parents communicated it was polite. They wished everyone a Merry Christmas, explained their reasons (overstimulation and flu concerns), and invited the family to come over. They didn't say the family couldn't come, just that the baby wouldn't be passed around. So the family's response seems overreactive. They might have felt excluded or not included, but the parents' main concern was the baby's health.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while some might expect to hold a newborn at a family gathering, the parents' priority is the baby's safety. It's a common practice in some cultures to limit handling of newborns, especially in the early weeks. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're being responsible. The family's reaction of cutting off the Christmas gathering seems like an overreaction to a reasonable request.\n\nI don't see any evidence that the parents are being selfish or unreasonable. They're making a decision based on health and safety, which is a valid reason. The family's response is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than the parents' actions being wrong. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
