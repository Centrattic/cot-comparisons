We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn during Christmas. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, which is technically full-term, but some might still consider it slightly preterm. The parents decided not to pass the baby around due to flu season concerns and overstimulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Even though 37 weeks is considered full-term in medical terms, babies born even a few weeks early might still have slightly underdeveloped immune systems. Flu season is a valid concern because young infants can get severely ill from the flu. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which seems reasonable.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. That's a strong reaction. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to visit otherwise. They're setting boundaries for the baby's well-being, not being rude. It's common for new parents to have rules about handling their baby, especially with health concerns.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' reasons: flu season and overstimulation. These are legitimate reasons, especially with a slightly preterm baby. The family's reaction seems over the top. The parents didn't exclude the family entirely, just not passing the baby around. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems harsh. \n\nHowever, maybe some family members felt slighted because they weren't allowed to hold the baby. But the parents made it clear that they could come hang out. The issue is whose needs are being prioritized. The baby's health is a primary concern here. \n\nIn most cases, new parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. The way the parents communicated it was respectful, explaining their reasons. So the parents aren't in the wrong. The family's reaction is unreasonable. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
