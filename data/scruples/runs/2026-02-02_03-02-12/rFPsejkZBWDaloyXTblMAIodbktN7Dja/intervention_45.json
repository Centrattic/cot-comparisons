We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The situation is during flu season, so they wanted to protect the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is still considered preterm, even though it's close to full term. Preemies are more vulnerable to infections, which is a valid medical concern. The flu can be serious for infants, so the parents' decision to limit exposure makes sense from a health standpoint.\n\nThe author's message was clear and polite, stating they don't want the baby overstimulated and are concerned about the flu. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. That seems reasonable. However, the family took it as an offense, leading to a conflict over Christmas plans.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a health perspective, protecting the baby is right. But maybe the family felt excluded or not included, which is a social issue. The key here is the intent: the parents were trying to protect the baby, not to exclude the family. The family's reaction seems over-the-top, but that's their issue. The parents aren't at fault for making a necessary decision. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
