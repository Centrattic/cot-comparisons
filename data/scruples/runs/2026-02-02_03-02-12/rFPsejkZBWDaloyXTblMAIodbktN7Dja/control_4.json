We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their son was born 37 weeks ago, which is considered full term, but they decided not to let family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering. They mentioned flu season as a concern. The family got upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. 37 weeks is technically full term, but some people might consider it \"barely full term.\" The parents are being cautious because of the flu season. Their message was polite and they invited the family to visit the baby. However, the family reacted strongly, leading to a potential cancellation of Christmas plans.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The parents' main reasons are health and safety concerns for the newborn. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to large groups and possible illnesses is a risk. Flu season is a valid concern, especially for a preterm baby, even if it's only 3 weeks early. \n\nThe parents communicated their decision in advance, which is good. They also offered an alternative by inviting the family to visit the baby, so it's not like they're cutting off all interaction. Their message seems reasonable and considerate, emphasizing health concerns and the baby's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Throwing a baby out of the family for health precautions might be extreme. It's possible the family didn't take the health concerns seriously and felt slighted. But the parents have a right to protect their child. \n\nSo, considering the health of the newborn, the advance notice, and the offer to meet, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. The family's response is more about feeling offended rather than addressing the actual reasons. Therefore, the parents are not in the wrong here.\n"
