We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered preterm but not extremely early. The parents mentioned flu season as a reason for not passing the baby around. They wanted to avoid overstimulation and health risks.\n\nNow, the key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus family expectations. New parents often have concerns about exposing newborns to illnesses, especially in flu season. 37 weeks is still full-term in some definitions, but others might consider it preterm. However, the main issue is the parents' decision to set boundaries for their baby's well-being.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to skip Christmas over this seems like a big overreaction. The parents communicated their decision politely, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. It's about setting reasonable boundaries, not being rude.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Some might argue that family traditions are important and that the parents are being too cautious. However, the health and safety of the newborn should be the priority. The parents have the right to make decisions about their child's care, even if it upsets others. The family's reaction of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate to the parents' request.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are acting in their child's best interest. They communicated clearly and respectfully. The family's response is the real issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
