We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about not letting family hold their almost full-term newborn is in the wrong. The baby was born 3 weeks early, which is 37 weeks. The parents wanted to avoid passing the baby around during flu season. They sent a message explaining that they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. The family reacted by saying if that's the case, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. 37 weeks is considered late preterm, which is still considered preterm. These babies can have health risks compared to full-term babies, even if they're only a few weeks early. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being, which is a common and responsible action.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. The parents communicated their wishes clearly and invited the family to be present but not to pass the baby around. It's possible the family felt slighted or not allowed to interact, but the parents are setting boundaries for health reasons, not to exclude them socially. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nThe parents are not being unreasonable. They're making a medical decision based on the baby's needs. The family should respect that even if they don't agree. The key here is that the parents are not refusing all interaction but are limiting it for a specific, responsible reason. The family's reaction suggests they might not have considered the health risks, which could actually make them the ones being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They're acting in their child's best interest, and the family's response is overly harsh.\n"
