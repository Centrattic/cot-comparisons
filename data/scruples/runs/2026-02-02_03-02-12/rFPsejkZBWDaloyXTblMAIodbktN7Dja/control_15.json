We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn who was born at 37 weeks. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas. The author's message was about safety due to flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical advice. A full-term pregnancy is considered 40 weeks, so 37 weeks is early but not extremely preterm. However, even a few weeks early can mean the baby is more vulnerable. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns can't get vaccinated and are at higher risk for complications. Also, overstimulation from too many people handling the baby might be a reasonable precaution, especially if the baby is still adjusting to life outside the womb.\n\nThe author's message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to visit. They didn't refuse visits entirely but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to cancel Christmas over health precautions is extreme. It's possible the family didn't take the health concerns seriously, which is their own issue.\n\nIn terms of social norms, new parents often set boundaries to protect their babies, especially in the first few weeks. The family's response suggests they might not understand or respect those boundaries, which isn't the author's fault. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's health. The family's threat is more about their own hurt feelings than the baby's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. Their concerns are valid, and they communicated clearly. The family overreacted, which is their own problem.\n"
