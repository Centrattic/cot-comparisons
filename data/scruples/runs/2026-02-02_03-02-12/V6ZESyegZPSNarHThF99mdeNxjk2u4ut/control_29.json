I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The author initially gave her the password because he thought there was nothing to hide, but then the girlfriend started going through his stuff, finding old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even checking his phone when he wasn't around. Now he's changing the passwords again to have some privacy, and she's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about privacy versus trust. The author gave the password once but now wants it back. The girlfriend is accessing his personal data without his consent, which is the issue. The author is trying to set boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. Just because someone wants to share access doesn't mean the other person has the right to invade privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and apps without permission are a breach of privacy. The author is reclaiming his right to privacy by changing passwords, which is a reasonable response. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt because she expected trust, but trust isn't about having access to each other's private information. True trust is respecting each other's boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just protecting his past, which is normal. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. Changing passwords to maintain privacy is his right. The real issue is the girlfriend not respecting his privacy by accessing his devices without consent. So the answer should be B.\n"
