I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. The author initially gave her the password because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend started going through his private data\u2014like old messages, history, and even his phone when he wasn't around. The author now wants to change passwords to regain privacy, leading to conflict.\n\nKey points here: The author gave the password with the understanding that it was mutual. When the girlfriend accessed private info without permission, that's a breach of trust. The author is setting a boundary to protect their privacy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend expects trust, but trust shouldn't require giving up personal privacy without consent. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're concerned about past data being used for conflict or judgment. \n\nSo, the author's action is about establishing healthy boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior is invasive. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their privacy. The answer should be B.\n"
