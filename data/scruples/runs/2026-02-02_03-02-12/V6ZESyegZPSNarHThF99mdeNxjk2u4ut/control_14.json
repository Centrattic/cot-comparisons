I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend moving in together and wanting shared access to each other's devices. The author gave her the password but later changed it because the girlfriend was snooping through personal stuff from the past, which embarrassed him. Now he's wondering if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust, which is common in some couples. However, the author felt that his privacy was being invaded when she went through his old messages and stuff. Even though there's nothing to hide, the act of sifting through past conversations and personal files without explicit permission might be crossing a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and respect for privacy. While sharing passwords can be a gesture of openness, it doesn't necessarily mean one should have unrestricted access to the other's personal history. The author's decision to change passwords could be seen as reclaiming personal space, which is reasonable if the partner is not respecting boundaries. However, the girlfriend might feel that the password change is a breach of trust, thinking she was entitled to that access because it was shared initially.\n\nI should also consider the balance between transparency and privacy. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's need for personal space. If the girlfriend was already going through his things without clear consent, the author has a right to set boundaries to protect his privacy. The embarrassment from past conversations isn't the main issue; it's about the invasion of privacy that triggered the password change.\n\nOn the other hand, if the password was given with the understanding that full access includes all personal data, then changing it might seem like going back on that agreement. However, the context here is that the access led to discomfort and privacy issues. So, the author's action is a response to that situation, not an initial move without cause.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his right to privacy after experiencing a violation. The girlfriend's actions prompted the password change, which is a reasonable step to maintain personal boundaries in the relationship.\n"
