I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is that they moved in with their girlfriend, and she wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. He gave her his password but then she started looking through his stuff, which made him uncomfortable. Now he's changing the passwords to regain privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend probably feels that sharing passwords is a normal part of a trusting relationship. She might see it as a commitment to transparency. On the other hand, the guy is setting boundaries because he's uncomfortable with her going through his personal data. He's not hiding anything, but the invasion of privacy is bothering him.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The guy initially gave her the password, which she used to access his devices. However, he didn't explicitly consent to her going through his past data, like old browser history or messages. Even though there's nothing to hide, the act of going through personal information without permission can be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nChanging passwords is his way of reestablishing personal boundaries. He's not doing it to hide something new but to prevent further intrusion into past, irrelevant content. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she values transparency, but the guy's need for privacy is also valid. In healthy relationships, there should be mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If she's upset about losing access, it might indicate that she's not respecting his need for privacy, which is his right.\n\nSo, considering that the guy has the right to his privacy even in a relationship, and the girlfriend's actions were intrusive despite his initial agreement to share passwords, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong. He's asserting his boundaries after experiencing discomfort from her actions.\n"
