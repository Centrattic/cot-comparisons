I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing their devices after she started going through their personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy gave his girlfriend his password to show trust but then she started looking through his things, like browser history, old conversations, and even his phone. He found that invasive and decided to change his passwords to regain some privacy. Now she's upset because she feels he's breaking trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and privacy. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust, which is understandable in a relationship. But when she used that access to invade his privacy, that's where the issue lies. The guy's reaction is about protecting his personal space, which is a common concern. People often have past experiences or things they don't want shared, even if they're not secret anymore.\n\nHe mentioned he doesn't have anything to hide, but he still has a right to privacy. The problem is that the girlfriend crossed a line by going through his messages and apps. The guy changing passwords is a reasonable response to set boundaries. Trust should be mutual, but it doesn't mean complete access to each other's private data without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that by sharing passwords, it's a mutual agreement. But maybe she didn't realize the extent of what that access entails. The guy's actions are about protecting his personal information, which is valid. So, in this case, the guy isn't in the wrong. He's trying to establish healthy boundaries after her actions made him uncomfortable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
