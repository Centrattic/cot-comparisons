I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves moving in together, shared passwords, and the girlfriend going through personal data. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a gesture of trust. The author agreed to give her the password but now feels the need to take it back after she accessed private information. The key here is about privacy versus trust.\n\nThe author's actions are about reclaiming personal privacy. Even though they initially agreed to share, boundaries can change. The girlfriend is upset because she sees this as breaking trust, but the author is trying to protect their personal space. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and boundaries are important. The author isn't hiding something malicious; they just want privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through old messages and files might be an invasion of privacy, which is why the author is pushing back. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to their privacy. It's a balance, but setting boundaries is normal. The answer should be B.\n"
