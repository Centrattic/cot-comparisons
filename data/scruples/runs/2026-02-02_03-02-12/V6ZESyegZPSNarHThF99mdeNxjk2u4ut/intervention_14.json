I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their personal devices and found old stuff. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend and the author moved in together and she asked for shared passwords to show trust. He agreed to give her his password, but he didn't want hers. Then she found some old data like porn in the browser history, old Skype messages with an ex, and photos on an old phone. She also went through his messages. He feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so he changes the passwords. She's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nThe key points here are privacy, trust, and boundaries. The author gave her the password, but she used it to go through his private stuff. Even if she has the password, that doesn't mean she has the right to invade his privacy. The author has a right to his own privacy, especially in personal devices. The fact that she's doing this without his consent is a problem. The author changing the passwords is a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nSome might argue that sharing passwords is a trust issue, but trust doesn't mean giving up all privacy. Healthy relationships require both trust and respect for each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's actions seem invasive, so the author's response is justified. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
