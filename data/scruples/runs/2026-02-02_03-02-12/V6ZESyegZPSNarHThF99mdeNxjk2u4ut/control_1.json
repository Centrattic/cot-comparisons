I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access as a trust gesture, but after she found personal stuff from the past, the author decided to change passwords.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend feels that sharing passwords is a sign of trust and that limiting access might indicate something to hide. On the other hand, the author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend goes through their personal data without explicit permission.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is personal privacy. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by securing their devices. They're within their right to set boundaries about their privacy. The girlfriend's actions of checking messages and apps without permission might be an overstep, even if her intention was to show trust. Everyone has the right to some level of privacy, especially in personal devices.\n\nHowever, the author did initially share their password, which set an expectation of access. Changing passwords after that could be seen as breaking that trust. But the author's reason is to regain privacy after feeling invaded. It's a balance between mutual trust and individual rights. \n\nCulturally, there's a debate about sharing digital access. Some see it as a trust-building step, others as an invasion. The author's actions are about self-respect and boundaries. The key here is whether the author has a right to privacy despite being in a relationship. Since they're not hiding anything malicious, just personal history, changing passwords seems reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're asserting their privacy after boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations regarding privacy in the relationship.\n"
