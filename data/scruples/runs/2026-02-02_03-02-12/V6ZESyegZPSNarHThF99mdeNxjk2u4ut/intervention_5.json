I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted access to their phone and computer to show trust, but the author changed their passwords after the girlfriend started going through their old stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author gave the password initially but changed it after the girlfriend found some personal stuff. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust. The author argues they need privacy.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through the author's devices without permission might be the real issue here. The author changed the passwords to protect their privacy after being violated. \n\nIs changing passwords a betrayal of trust? It depends on the agreement. If the author had given the password with the understanding that there should be mutual trust, then changing it might seem like breaking that trust. But if the password was given as a courtesy and the author felt their privacy was being invaded, then it's a valid step to protect themselves.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't have anything to hide, but the girlfriend's behavior made them uncomfortable. The author's action is about reclaiming privacy after a breach. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to privacy even in a relationship. The mistake was the girlfriend's for going through things without permission. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
