I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it after she found some old, personal stuff and started looking through his messages. He's now upset about his privacy being invaded, even though he knows there's nothing to hide. The girlfriend is upset because he's changing the passwords, thinking trust is important.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy versus trust. The author is asserting their right to privacy by changing passwords, but the girlfriend feels betrayed because she expected trust. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is individual privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with his past being pried into. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that not sharing access is a breach of trust. But the author isn't hiding current secrets\u2014just old stuff that's irrelevant now. \n\nI think the author is justified in wanting privacy. People have the right to control access to their personal devices and messages. The fact that the girlfriend is invading his privacy by looking through his messages without his consent is problematic. Changing the password is a reasonable step to prevent further intrusion. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their privacy, which is a valid concern, even in a relationship.\n"
