I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend wanting shared access to devices, but the person didn't like that she was going through their private stuff.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but didn't expect her to look through everything. Then she found old stuff and even went through his messages. The author felt embarrassed and decided to change passwords to regain privacy. Now, the girlfriend is upset because she thinks trust is important.\n\nSo, the key points are mutual trust and privacy. The author isn't hiding anything; they just want some personal space. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping by invading his privacy. The act of changing passwords is about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. Trust is important, but respecting each other's privacy is also crucial. The author didn't do anything wrong by setting these boundaries. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
