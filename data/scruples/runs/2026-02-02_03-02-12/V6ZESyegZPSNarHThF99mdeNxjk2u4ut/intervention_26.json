I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about moving in with a girlfriend and sharing passwords. The guy gave her his passwords to show trust, but she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and now he's changing them back to keep his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend wanted shared access as a sign of trust. The guy agreed initially but then changed his mind after she invaded his privacy by looking through his messages and found old stuff. He's now locking things down again, which she's upset about.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. From one angle, trust in a relationship is important. If he agreed to share passwords, changing them might seem like breaking that trust. But on the flip side, privacy is also a valid concern. People have the right to personal space even in relationships. The fact that she went through his messages without his consent is a red flag. That's a privacy violation, which could justify him wanting to set boundaries.\n\nI should think about typical relationship advice. Experts often say that both trust and privacy need to coexist. Maybe the girlfriend's actions were overstepping, so the guy's reaction is reasonable. Also, old conversations and browsing history are personal. Finding them is one thing, but being invasive is another. The guy's embarrassment shows that the invasion of privacy affected him emotionally, which is a valid reason to seek some boundaries.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. He might have needed to talk to her first before changing passwords instead of just doing it. However, the situation shows he had tried to explain his need for privacy and she wasn't respecting that. So maybe he's justified in taking action to protect his privacy after her behavior crossed a line.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
