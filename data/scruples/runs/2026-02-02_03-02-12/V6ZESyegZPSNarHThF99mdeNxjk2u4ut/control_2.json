I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend wanting shared access to each other's devices as a trust gesture, but the author felt uncomfortable after she went through his private data. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords, which the author initially resisted but eventually gave. Then she found various personal things like browser history, old messages, and photos. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so he changes the passwords. She's upset because she sees this as a breach of trust.\n\nThe key issue here is privacy versus trust. The author gave her the passwords, which she used to access his stuff, but he drew a line when he felt his privacy was invaded. The question is whether changing passwords is justified.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and boundaries are important. Even though the girlfriend wanted to show trust by sharing passwords, the author's right to privacy isn't negated. It's reasonable for him to set boundaries, especially if he's uncomfortable with her accessing his personal data without explicit consent. The fact that she went through his messages without asking might be a violation of his trust. Changing passwords to protect his privacy isn't inherently wrong; it's about maintaining personal space. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she wanted openness. But the author's actions were a response to her actions. The main point is that both should communicate and agree on what's acceptable. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting his privacy needs.\n"
