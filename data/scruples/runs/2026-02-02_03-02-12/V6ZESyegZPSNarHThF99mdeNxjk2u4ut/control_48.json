I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend wants to share passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after the girlfriend started going through his personal stuff. The key points here are privacy and trust. \n\nThe author argues that they have a right to privacy, even in a relationship. They mention that the girlfriend found old, irrelevant stuff, which is embarrassing but not harmful. The girlfriend feels betrayed by the password change, thinking it's a sign of lacking trust.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. Trust should be about respecting each other's boundaries. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical by changing the password. Everyone has a right to some level of privacy. However, the girlfriend's actions of going through his devices without consent are also an issue. \n\nThe author is protecting their personal space, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's expectation of full access without the same boundaries might be unrealistic. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asserting their privacy, which is a common and understandable practice. \n\nBut there's also a communication issue here. The author should probably discuss their boundaries more openly to avoid misunderstandings. But the act of changing passwords itself isn't wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
