I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access to their devices as a show of trust, but the person felt the need to set boundaries when the girlfriend started going through their private stuff. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust and privacy in a relationship. The girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords, which is a common practice some couples do to show transparency. However, the author felt that their privacy was being invaded when the girlfriend accessed their past messages and other personal data without permission. \n\nThe key points here are mutual trust versus personal privacy. The author gave their password as a gesture of trust but later decided to change it after finding out the girlfriend was going through their things. The girlfriend is upset because she believes trust is about full access, but the author is asserting their right to some level of privacy.\n\nI should also think about the reasons the author gave. They mentioned embarrassment and feeling that their past conversations and media were being intruded upon. It's reasonable for someone to want to maintain some personal space even in a committed relationship. The fact that the author initially gave the password but later changed it suggests they felt the need to protect their privacy after experiencing discomfort.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The author gave the password once but didn't consent to ongoing access, especially when the girlfriend started prying into old data. The author's decision to secure their devices again is about setting boundaries, which is a healthy part of any relationship. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that trust should mean complete openness. But that's a bit of a misconception because trust doesn't necessarily require full access to all private information. People have the right to keep certain things private, especially if they're not harming the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their personal space and addressing the discomfort caused by the girlfriend's actions. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's expectations and lack of respecting boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
