I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it because the girlfriend was going through his personal stuff. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean he wouldn't hide anything. \n\nSo, the main points here are privacy, trust, and boundaries in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful; the content found was old and not relevant anymore. The girlfriend's actions of checking his messages without permission might be an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe author's decision to change passwords is about reclaiming their personal space. In many relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. Just because someone shares passwords doesn't mean they have to allow unrestricted access to all personal data. Especially if the partner is snooping without consent. \n\nThe girlfriend's expectation of unlimited access might be unrealistic. Trust doesn't mean you have to give up all privacy. The author is setting a boundary, which is healthy. \n\nI think the author is right to protect their privacy. So the answer should be B.\n"
