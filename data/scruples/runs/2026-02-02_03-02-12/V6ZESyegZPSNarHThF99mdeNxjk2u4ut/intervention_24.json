I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password, explaining they don't want her password because they don't need to check her stuff. Then the girlfriend found some old, potentially embarrassing stuff from the past. The author feels uncomfortable and decides to change the passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, saying trust is supposed to work both ways.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show mutual trust in a relationship. The author did give their password initially, so maybe there was an expectation of continued access. But the author had boundaries about not needing the girlfriend's passwords because they don't need to check her stuff. That seems like a reasonable boundary too.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement. When the author gave the password, they might have thought it was a one-time thing, not expecting regular access. The girlfriend's actions of looking through messages and apps, even if not malicious, might have crossed into the author's personal space, leading to the author feeling the need to set a boundary.\n\nAlso, the things the girlfriend found were old and not relevant anymore. The author's discomfort is valid. Everyone has the right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The fact that the author felt embarrassed and needed to change the passwords to maintain that privacy is a personal right.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being inconsistent\u2014giving the password at first but then taking it away. But the author's decision to change the passwords is about protecting their own privacy after experiencing the invasion of privacy from the girlfriend's actions. It's about maintaining personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to privacy and are setting boundaries after feeling their privacy was invaded. The answer should be B.\n"
