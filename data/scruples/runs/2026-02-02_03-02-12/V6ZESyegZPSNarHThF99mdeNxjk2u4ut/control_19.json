I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her the password, explaining there's nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found some old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even went through his phone. The author then decides to change the passwords to maintain privacy, which upset the girlfriend. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and devices without permission are a problem. Even if the author initially shared the password, that doesn't mean the girlfriend has the right to invade his privacy by checking his messages. The author is setting a boundary by changing the passwords, which is about reclaiming their right to privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that trust is important and that not sharing access is a breach of that trust. But trust shouldn't require someone to allow full access to their personal devices and messages. Healthy relationships involve trust but also respect for each other's privacy. \n\nThe author's actions are a reasonable response to the girlfriend's overstepping. They have the right to keep their personal information private, especially if it's causing them discomfort. The girlfriend might need to understand that privacy and trust can coexist. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
