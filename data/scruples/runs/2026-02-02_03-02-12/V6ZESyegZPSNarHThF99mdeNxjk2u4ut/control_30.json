I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. Let me look at the situation again.\n\nSo, the guy and his girlfriend moved in together. She asked for shared passwords to show trust. He gave her his password because he didn't have anything to hide, but he didn't want her password. Then she found some stuff in his history, old messages, pictures, and even saw her going through his phone. He felt embarrassed and changed his passwords to keep his privacy. She got upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nHmm, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Trust is important in a relationship. But privacy is also important. The girlfriend wanted access, maybe to show trust, but he feels like she's invading his privacy by going through his stuff. He changed the passwords to protect his personal information.\n\nOn one hand, he gave her the password initially, so maybe she expected ongoing access. But then she started prying into things that were old and not relevant. He had the right to change it if he felt uncomfortable. The key is that he's setting boundaries for his privacy. Even though he gave her the password before, he can change it if he feels his privacy is being invaded. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is accessing his messages and apps without clear consent. That's a problem. He's trying to reclaim his privacy by changing passwords. So, he's not wrong for doing that. The answer should be B (No).\n"
