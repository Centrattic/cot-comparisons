I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared passwords as a sign of trust, while the guy is uncomfortable with her going through his stuff, even though he gave her the password initially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend brought up sharing passwords to show trust. The guy gave her his password, but now she's prying into his past, which he finds embarrassing. He changed the passwords to regain privacy, which upset her because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy vs. trust in a relationship. On one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a way to build trust, but it also requires respecting the other person's privacy. The girl might feel entitled to access because of the initial password sharing, but that doesn't necessarily mean she has the right to invade his privacy. He has a right to his personal space, even in a relationship. The fact that she's going through his messages and old data without his consent is problematic. He's not hiding anything malicious; it's just past stuff that's irrelevant now. His action to change passwords is about setting boundaries, not necessarily hiding something. \n\nBut then again, by initially giving her the password, he might have implied that he didn't mind her accessing his devices. So there's a conflict between his right to privacy and her expectations of trust. However, it's possible that he changed the passwords because he realized his privacy was being violated, which is his prerogative. The question is whether he's in the wrong for setting that boundary. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He should have discussed his discomfort with her prying before changing passwords. But given that she was already going through his things, maybe he had a right to protect his privacy. The fact that he's not hiding anything now but is upset about past content shows that it's more about personal boundaries than secrecy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's asserting his privacy after her behavior made him uncomfortable. She might need to respect his boundaries without taking it personally.\n"
