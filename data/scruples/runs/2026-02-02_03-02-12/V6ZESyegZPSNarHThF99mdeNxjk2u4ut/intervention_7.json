I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves trust and privacy in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it when the girlfriend went through his private data, causing embarrassment. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as setting a boundary to maintain privacy, which is reasonable. People have the right to some level of privacy, even in relationships. However, the girlfriend might feel hurt or think the author isn't being trusting. \n\nBut the problem started when the girlfriend accessed private information without permission. The author's response was to change passwords, which is a way to protect their privacy. It's a common issue in relationships where people might assume access to certain information without consent. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because maintaining privacy isn't unreasonable, especially after the girlfriend violated those boundaries. The main issue is the lack of mutual respect for each other's privacy. So the answer should be B.\n"
