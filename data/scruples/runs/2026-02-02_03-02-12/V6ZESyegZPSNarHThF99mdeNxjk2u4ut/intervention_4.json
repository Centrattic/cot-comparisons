I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The author moved in together with the girlfriend, and she wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. He gave her his password but later changed it after she went through his stuff and found old, embarrassing stuff. Now he's upset and wants privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Trust is a big part of relationships, but so is personal privacy. The author made it clear he didn't want her passwords because he didn't see a need, but he gave her his. However, she ended up invading his privacy by looking through his devices, which made him uncomfortable. \n\nChanging passwords to regain privacy seems like a reasonable step. People have a right to their privacy even in a relationship. The girlfriend might see it as a breach of trust, but if the original agreement was mutual and the author felt pressured or uncomfortable later, he's within his rights to set boundaries. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014going through messages and old files\u2014could be seen as invasive. The author's response is about protecting his own space, not hiding something. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would argue that if you agree to share passwords, you can't just change them later. However, the key point is that the author felt his privacy was violated, which is a valid concern.\n"
