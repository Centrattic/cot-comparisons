I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author changed them after she went through their private data.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust and privacy in a relationship. The girlfriend initially wanted shared access, which the author reluctantly provided. Then the girlfriend accessed personal information, making the author uncomfortable. The author then changed the passwords to regain privacy.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through the author's messages and other data without permission might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the author gave her the password. The author has the right to their privacy, especially regarding past communications and personal files. Changing passwords to protect that privacy isn't necessarily wrong; it's about setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she expected trust. But trust should be mutual and mutual respect for each other's privacy is also key. The author's actions could be justified as a way to protect their personal space. The girlfriend's behavior of intruding into the author's private data without consent is problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain their privacy after experiencing intrusion. The issue here is about mutual respect and boundaries. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
