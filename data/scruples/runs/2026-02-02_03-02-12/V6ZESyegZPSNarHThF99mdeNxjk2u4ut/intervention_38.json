I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The author is moving in with their girlfriend and had given her their password initially, but after she found some old, possibly embarrassing items, they decided to change the passwords to maintain privacy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault here. I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author gave the password voluntarily, showing a willingness to share and trust. The girlfriend might feel that changing the passwords is a betrayal of trust. On the other hand, the author has a right to privacy. Even if there's nothing to hide, personal devices are private by nature, and it's reasonable to set boundaries, especially after the girlfriend started going through old messages and files without consent, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and boundaries. The author gave the password initially, but after experiencing the girlfriend's actions (looking through messages, finding old stuff), they felt uncomfortable. Changing passwords isn't about hiding something but about setting personal boundaries. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through old conversations and files\u2014might be overstepping, so the author's response is a way to protect their privacy. \n\nI think the author is justified in changing the passwords because they have a right to privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's expectation of access without consent isn't reasonable, especially after she intruded into the author's personal space. The author isn't hiding anything but is maintaining their right to privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
