I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wanted shared access to devices after moving in together. The author gave her the password but later changed it after she went through his private stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and privacy. The author initially gave the password voluntarily, which might imply some level of trust. But then the girlfriend accessed private information without permission. Even if the author said there's nothing to hide, the act of going through someone's messages without asking is a privacy violation. \n\nThe author changing the password is a way to reclaim privacy. The girlfriend's argument about trust is valid, but trust should be mutual. If one person's actions (like snooping) undermine that trust, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The girlfriend accessed private info without consent. 2) The author is asserting their right to privacy. 3) The initial password sharing was voluntary but doesn't negate the need for ongoing consent. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for changing the passwords to protect their privacy after being violated. The answer should be B.\n"
