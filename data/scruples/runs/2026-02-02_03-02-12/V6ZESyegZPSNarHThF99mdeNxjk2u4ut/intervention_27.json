I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access as a sign of trust, but the author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, their past conversations and files are being found, which is embarrassing. The author changed the passwords to maintain privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, thinking trust is important.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords shows trust and openness. She might feel that the author is being secretive if they take back the access. On the other hand, the author is asserting their right to privacy, even within a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything malicious but wants to keep personal history private.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is respecting individual boundaries. The author gave the password initially but felt the need to retract it when they noticed the girlfriend invading their privacy by checking messages and old files. The key point here is that the author isn't hiding anything new; it's about past content that's now being found. The author's action is about setting boundaries, which is normal. The girlfriend is overstepping by going through personal items without consent.\n\nThe question is whether changing passwords is a breach of trust. If sharing passwords was a mutual agreement to show trust, then changing them might be seen as breaking that. However, if the author felt uncomfortable with how the access was being used (like snooping), then it's a case of protecting personal space. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're just reclaiming their privacy. The girlfriend's actions of looking through messages and old files without clear permission are the real issue here.\n\nSo, the author is acting to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable action. The girlfriend is in the wrong for invading privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
