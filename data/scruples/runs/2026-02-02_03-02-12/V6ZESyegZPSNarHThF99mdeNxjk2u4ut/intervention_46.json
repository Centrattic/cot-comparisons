I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. \n\nThe situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password, but then the girlfriend went through his private stuff like browser history, old messages, and even his phone. The author found this invasive and decided to change the passwords to maintain privacy, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about privacy versus trust. The girlfriend wanted access as a symbol of trust, but when given access, she used it to invade the author's privacy. The author changed the passwords to protect their own personal information, which had become a source of embarrassment when the girlfriend went through it. \n\nI think the author is justified. Everyone deserves some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions were overstepping, especially since the author had made it clear they didn't want her to have their passwords. The fact that the author gave in once but then felt violated when the passwords were used to access past, irrelevant information seems like a breach of trust from the girlfriend's side. \n\nThe author isn't hiding anything malicious; it's old stuff that's not relevant now. The girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity or a lack of understanding about boundaries. The author is setting a boundary to protect their privacy, which is a healthy thing. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
