I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that they moved in with their girlfriend, and she wanted shared access to their devices. The author initially gave her the password because they had nothing to hide, but now the girlfriend has found various personal stuff from the past. The author is changing the passwords again to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust is important. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to privacy. Even in a relationship, personal boundaries are important. Just because someone is in your life doesn't mean they have the right to access your personal devices. The author might feel that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend goes through their messages and old data. Changing passwords to protect that privacy seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that trust is a two-way street. She might see shared passwords as a sign of commitment and transparency. The author gave her the password initially, which set an expectation. When the author revokes access, it could be seen as a breach of that trust. But the author is now setting boundaries to protect their personal space, which is also valid.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect for boundaries and communication. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by changing passwords. Everyone has the right to personal privacy. The girlfriend might need to respect that even in a relationship, some level of privacy is necessary. The issue could stem from differing expectations about what sharing passwords entails. The author's actions are about reclaiming their privacy after feeling it's been compromised. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy, and the girlfriend needs to accept that even in a trusting relationship, there are personal boundaries.\n"
