I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is a girlfriend wanting shared passwords to show trust, but the guy is uncomfortable because she started going through his stuff and found old, irrelevant stuff. He changed his passwords, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants transparency because they live together. But the guy feels his privacy is invaded when she goes through his messages and old stuff. Even though there's nothing to hide, the act of someone going through your personal data without permission can be uncomfortable. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The guy gave her the password initially but later changed it when he felt his privacy was being breached. It's a common issue where boundaries aren't clear. The key here is that he's not hiding anything malicious, just personal history. \n\nThe girlfriend might see password changing as a lack of trust, but the guy is asserting his right to privacy. It's a balance. The question is whether changing passwords is a reasonable action to maintain privacy without breaking trust. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because he's setting boundaries to protect his privacy, especially after she violated it by going through his stuff. Trust doesn't mean giving up all privacy. It's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries.\n"
