I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed personal information. The situation involves trust issues and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author initially gave their password to show trust, but the girlfriend used it to find old stuff, which made the author uncomfortable. The author's main concern is privacy, especially regarding old messages and photos that aren't relevant now. They changed passwords to regain some privacy, which the girlfriend sees as a lack of trust.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Trust is important in a relationship, but so is personal privacy. The author gave the password with the understanding that there's nothing to hide, but the girlfriend's actions\u2014going through messages and old files\u2014invade that privacy. The author's response to change passwords is about setting boundaries to protect their personal space, which is a reasonable self-protective measure.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that trust is essential is valid, but trust should work both ways. If the author feels their privacy is violated, it's their right to protect it. The key point is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just asserting their right to privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries after experiencing discomfort from the girlfriend's actions.\n"
