I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords after a girlfriend looked through his personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author gave his girlfriend his passwords to show trust, but she started prying into his past stuff like browser history, old messages, and even looked through his phone. He finds this embarrassing and wants to change passwords to regain some privacy. She's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author gave her access initially, but now he's trying to revoke that. He mentions that he doesn't care about the content she found but wants privacy from future prying. The girlfriend argues that trust means allowing access, but the author feels his privacy is being invaded.\n\nIn relationships, mutual trust and respect for boundaries are important. The author's action is about protecting his personal space, which is a valid need. However, he did give her access first, which might complicate things. But the issue is that she's invading his privacy even after he set boundaries. The author is reclaiming his privacy, which is reasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). He has the right to his privacy, even in a relationship. If he gave her access initially, he can change that if it makes him uncomfortable. The girlfriend's actions (looking through his messages) are the real issue here. The author's response to set boundaries by changing passwords is appropriate.\n"
