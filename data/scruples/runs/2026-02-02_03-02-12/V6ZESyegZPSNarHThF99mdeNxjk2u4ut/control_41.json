I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting shared access to each other's devices as a sign of trust, but the person decided to change their passwords after the girlfriend went through their stuff, found old stuff, and invaded privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend expected shared passwords as a gesture of trust, which is common in some relationships. The author did share their own password, showing they trusted her. However, the girlfriend then accessed things like porn history, old messages, and private photos, which the author found embarrassing. The author then changed the passwords to maintain privacy, which leads to the conflict.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The girlfriend might believe that sharing passwords implies mutual access, but the author now wants privacy. The author's actions could be seen as reclaiming personal space, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend might feel betrayed because she thought the initial password sharing meant trust. \n\nBut the author's main issue is about privacy. They want to protect their personal data, especially old messages and files that are irrelevant now. It's about respecting each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of looking through the author's things without permission might be the real problem here. The author changing passwords is a way to prevent further invasions of privacy, which is a valid reason.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is individual privacy. The author isn't hiding anything sinister; they just want to keep personal matters to themselves. The girlfriend's behavior of snooping without consent is problematic. The author's decision to set boundaries by changing passwords is a reasonable response to protect their privacy, especially after the repeated invasions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to privacy even in a relationship. The girlfriend might need to respect those boundaries instead of expecting full access. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
