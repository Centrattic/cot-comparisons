I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password, explaining they don't have anything to hide. But then the girlfriend started looking through his stuff\u2014porn in browser history, old Skype chats with an ex, pictures from an old phone, and even checking messages. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so they change their passwords. The girlfriend is upset, thinking they should trust each other.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are consent and boundaries. The author initially gave the password willingly, but the girlfriend's actions went beyond what was probably agreed upon when they shared the password. The author's main issue isn't hiding something but maintaining privacy. Even though they said there's nothing to hide, the invasion of personal data is a breach of trust in the opposite direction.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy is important. If one person is uncomfortable with the other accessing their personal data, especially when it's not necessary, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The girlfriend might feel betrayed by the password change, but the author is just protecting their own space. The fact that the author is up front about the issue and hasn't tried to hide anything makes their actions more about self-respect than deceit. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their right to privacy after the other party overstepped. The problem here is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's response to it.\n"
