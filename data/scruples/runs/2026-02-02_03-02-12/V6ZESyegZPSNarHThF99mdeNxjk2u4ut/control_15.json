I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing their devices, after she's gone through their past data and messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend initially asked for shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password, but then the girlfriend started prying into personal stuff like browser history, old messages, and even messages on the phone. The author found this embarrassing and decided to change the passwords to regain some privacy.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. Let's break down the key points. The author made it clear they didn't want the girlfriend's passwords, implying they value their own privacy. However, they did give their password, maybe thinking there's nothing to hide. But the girlfriend's actions crossed boundaries by going through personal data. The author then changed the passwords to protect their privacy, which led to the girlfriend feeling upset because she believes in mutual trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is individual privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as invasive, especially going through old messages and personal files. The author's response to set boundaries by changing passwords is about maintaining personal space. It's a common issue where mutual trust and individual privacy can conflict.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their right to privacy. The girlfriend's expectation of access without limits isn't reasonable if it leads to prying into personal matters. The author's action is a legitimate way to protect their personal information, especially after the girlfriend overstepped. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
