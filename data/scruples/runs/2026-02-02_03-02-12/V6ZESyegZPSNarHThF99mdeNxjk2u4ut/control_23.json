I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but now wants to change it because the girlfriend has been going through his private data\u2014browser history, old Skype messages, pictures, and messages. The author feels the need for privacy and is changing passwords, which the girlfriend is upset about, arguing that trust is important.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of relationships, but so is personal privacy. The author gave the password once but then realized that the girlfriend was accessing his private information without consent. The key point is that the girlfriend was \"going through conversations in my messages and apps\" when he wasn't around. That's a privacy issue. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect their personal data, which is reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is based on trust, but trust shouldn't require someone to waive their right to privacy. There's a difference between mutual trust and respecting each other's boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just reclaiming their privacy after the girlfriend overstepped.\n\nHowever, the author initially agreed to share the password, which might have led the girlfriend to believe that access was acceptable. Now, changing passwords could be seen as a boundary shift without prior discussion, which might cause friction. But given the context of the girlfriend's actions, the author's decision is a response to protect their privacy, not to hide something.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate boundaries. The author might have handled it differently by discussing their discomfort with unsolicited access before changing passwords. But the core issue is the girlfriend's behavior violating the author's privacy. The author's action is a reasonable step to set those boundaries, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
