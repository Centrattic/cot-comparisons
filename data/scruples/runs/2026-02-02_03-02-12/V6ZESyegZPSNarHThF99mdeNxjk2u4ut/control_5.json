I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting access to their devices as a trust thing, but the person changed their passwords after she went through their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend initially wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, which some might see as normal, but the person didn't reciprocate by asking for her passwords. Now she's invading their privacy by looking through old messages and browsing history. The person is setting a boundary by changing passwords to regain privacy.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries around privacy are important. While sharing passwords can be a gesture of trust, it's not mandatory. The girlfriend's actions of invading privacy without consent are problematic. The person changing passwords is asserting their right to privacy, which is reasonable. They didn't have to give her the password in the first place, so it's a two-way street. The key issue here is consent and mutual respect for boundaries. The person isn't in the wrong for protecting their personal space, especially after the invasion of privacy. So the answer should be B.\n"
