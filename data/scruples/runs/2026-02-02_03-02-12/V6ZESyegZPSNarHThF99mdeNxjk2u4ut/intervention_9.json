I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a trust gesture. The author gave her the password but then changed it after she started prying into his private data. He's concerned about his privacy, even though there's nothing to hide. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The author initially agreed to share passwords, maybe out of a sense of trust. But when the girlfriend accessed private information without consent, the author felt the need to set boundaries by changing passwords. The question is whether changing passwords is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author might argue that everyone deserves privacy, even in a relationship. They shared passwords voluntarily, but after invasion of privacy, it's reasonable to revoke access. The girlfriend might feel that trust requires transparency, and changing passwords is a sign of distrust.\n\nBut the author isn't hiding anything; they're just protecting old data that's irrelevant now. It's about personal boundaries. The fact that the girlfriend is going through messages without consent is a red flag. The author's action is proactive to prevent further intrusion. So, maintaining privacy isn't about hiding but about respecting personal space.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. Trust should involve respect for boundaries. The author isn't doing anything wrong by protecting their privacy. The girlfriend's behavior of snooping without consent is the issue here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
