I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the author changed them back after she went through his stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust and privacy in relationships. It's common for couples to discuss boundaries around privacy. The author gave the password initially but then changed it after the girlfriend invaded his privacy. He's not upset about the content she found, just the invasion of privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend argues that trust means sharing, but the author feels entitled to some privacy. The key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. Even in a trusting relationship, people might want personal space. The author isn't hiding something malicious; he's just reclaiming his privacy after it was violated.\n\nI should also think about consent. The author gave the password once, but the girlfriend's actions crossed the line. The author's response is to set boundaries again, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a different view on trust. \n\nIs changing passwords a valid way to protect privacy? Yes. If someone is uncomfortable with the level of access the other has, adjusting passwords is a common way to establish personal space. The author isn't being secretive for a harmful reason but to protect past, irrelevant content.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after it was invaded. The real issue might be communication gaps or differing expectations about privacy in a relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
