I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend wants shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password, knowing there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend went through his stuff, found old, irrelevant stuff, and he wants privacy back. \n\nSo, the main issue is about privacy versus trust. The author feels that even though there's no secret, the girlfriend's actions are invading his personal space. He changed the passwords to regain some privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels it's about trust.\n\nI think the key here is mutual respect for privacy. Even in a relationship, people have a right to personal space. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, even if she's not doing it with bad intent. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Probably not. He's protecting his privacy. The girlfriend might need to respect his boundaries. So the answer is B (No).\n"
