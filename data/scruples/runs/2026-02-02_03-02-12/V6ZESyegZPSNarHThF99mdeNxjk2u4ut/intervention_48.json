I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, explaining that there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found various personal items\u2014porn in the browser history, old Skype chats with an ex from 2013, pictures from an old phone in a box, and started looking through his messages. The author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, these are personal and embarrassing. So he decides to change the passwords to regain some privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean no need for passwords.\n\nSo the key points here are: mutual trust, privacy boundaries, and the girlfriend's actions versus the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's main argument is about privacy. Even though he shares his passwords initially, he feels that after the girlfriend's actions (looking through his messages, finding old stuff), he's entitled to set boundaries. The girlfriend, on the other hand, values transparency and trust through shared access.\n\nIn relationships, privacy and trust can be a balancing act. Some people are comfortable with more transparency, others prefer some level of privacy. The author isn't hiding anything new or harmful; he's dealing with old, potentially embarrassing content that doesn't affect their current relationship. His right to privacy might be valid, especially since the girlfriend is actively prying into his personal data without his consent once he's given access.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if she's looking through his messages without a clear reason. The author changed passwords to prevent that, which could be a reasonable step to protect his privacy. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that trust means sharing everything. She might feel that the author is being secretive now, which could lead to tension. The core issue is whether the author is justified in setting these boundaries. \n\nIn many cases, people expect some level of privacy even in relationships. The fact that the author isn't hiding anything new and is just trying to reclaim his personal space suggests he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (looking through his messages) could be the real issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
