I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password, but the girlfriend started snooping through old things, which embarrassed the author. Now the author wants to change passwords to maintain privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that the shared passwords are a sign of trust, so when the author blocks access, she's upset. But the author has a right to privacy. The key points here are trust versus privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious, just old, irrelevant stuff. The girlfriend's actions of snooping, even if not illegal, can be intrusive.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author made it clear they didn't want the girlfriend's passwords, which shows they respect her privacy. However, they gave their own password initially, thinking there was nothing to hide. But when the girlfriend used that access to invade the author's privacy, it's a breach of trust. The author's response to change passwords is about reclaiming their own privacy, which is reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be based on misunderstanding that shared passwords are a two-way thing. The author isn't being deceitful; they're setting boundaries. The fact that the author is upfront about their reasons (embarrassment from past things) shows they aren't hiding anything harmful. The main issue is that the girlfriend overstepped by accessing personal data without consent, and the author is correcting that by securing their own devices.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to privacy and are responding to the girlfriend's invasion of privacy. It's about mutual respect and setting boundaries.\n"
