I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed them after she found some personal stuff in his history and old messages. The author is now changing passwords to maintain privacy, even though they had previously agreed to share.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author mentions they have nothing to hide but feel that their privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend is upset because she believes they should trust each other. On one hand, sharing passwords was a mutual agreement, and changing them might break that trust. On the other hand, the author feels the need for privacy after their partner went through personal information without consent.\n\nI think the key points here are consent and boundaries. The girlfriend is accessing the author's private information without being asked, which can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author gave the password initially, if the terms of sharing have changed, it's reasonable for the author to set new boundaries. The author is not hiding anything malicious but wants to protect past, irrelevant content. \n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend's actions (looking through messages, finding old stuff) made the author uncomfortable, changing passwords is a way to set boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their privacy after a breach of trust from the other side. The answer should be B."
