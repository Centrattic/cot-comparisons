I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who wanted shared access to their devices as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her their password but later changed it after she went through his stuff, found old things, and invaded his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. Trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend expected access, but the author felt uncomfortable after seeing her go through his messages and find stuff that was embarrassing. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and consent. The author gave the password initially, maybe expecting a two-way agreement, but the girlfriend didn't reciprocate. She accessed his devices without his consent once he had changed the password, which is a breach of privacy. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's privacy. The author has the right to set boundaries and reclaim their privacy, especially if they feel invaded. Changing passwords isn't about hiding secrets but about maintaining personal space. The girlfriend's actions of snooping without permission are the real issue here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their privacy. The problem lies with the girlfriend not respecting the author's boundaries once the passwords were changed. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
