I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author moved in with his girlfriend and initially gave her his password, even though he didn't ask for hers. He felt there was nothing to hide. But she started going through his old data\u2014browser history, old messages, etc.\u2014which made him uncomfortable. Now he wants to reset his passwords to have privacy, and she's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nThe key points here are privacy versus trust. The author is setting boundaries to protect his personal information, which is reasonable. Everyone has the right to privacy, even in a relationship. However, the girlfriend might feel that this is a breach of trust since she expects access because she was given his password. But the author didn't ask for hers, so there's an imbalance there. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because he's reclaiming his privacy after feeling his boundaries were violated. The girlfriend's actions of going through his things without consent are actually the issue here. The author's response is about protecting his personal space, which is valid. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
