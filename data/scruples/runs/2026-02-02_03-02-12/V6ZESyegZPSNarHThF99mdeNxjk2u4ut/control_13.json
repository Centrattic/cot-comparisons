I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that they moved in with their girlfriend and initially gave her their password to show trust. The girlfriend then found some old stuff and went through conversations, which embarrassed the author. Now they changed their passwords to keep some privacy and are being accused by their girlfriend of not trusting her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective is about maintaining personal privacy. Even though they gave the password initially, they later felt that having their private information accessed without their presence was uncomfortable. The girlfriend's argument is about trust and sharing in a relationship. She might feel that keeping passwords is a breach of trust.\n\nBut the key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. In a relationship, both partners should have some level of privacy. The author isn't hiding anything harmful; they're just protecting embarrassing or irrelevant past data. The girlfriend's actions of going through messages and old files without permission are the real issue here. The author has the right to set boundaries. Changing passwords isn't about distrust but about maintaining personal space. The girlfriend might need to understand that privacy doesn't equate to dishonesty. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The problem is more about the girlfriend's invasion of privacy rather than the author's action to prevent it. The answer should be B, No.\n"
