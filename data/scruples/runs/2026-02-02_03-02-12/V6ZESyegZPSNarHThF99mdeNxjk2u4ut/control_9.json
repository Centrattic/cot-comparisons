I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their private stuff without permission.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. The author gave her the password but later realized she was going through his stuff\u2014like browser history, old messages, and photos. Even though the author says there's nothing to hide, they're uncomfortable with the invasion of privacy. \n\nThe key point here is mutual respect in a relationship. While sharing passwords can be a way to show trust, it's also about boundaries. The girlfriend accessed private data without consent, which is a breach of trust. The author is trying to set boundaries by changing passwords to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable reaction. \n\nSome might argue that changing passwords could seem like hiding something, but the context shows the author isn't hiding anything new; they just want to prevent future invasions of privacy. The girlfriend's actions were the initial problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their personal space.\n"
