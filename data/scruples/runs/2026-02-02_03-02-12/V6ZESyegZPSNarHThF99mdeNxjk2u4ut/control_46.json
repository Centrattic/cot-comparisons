I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend started going through their stuff is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. He gave her his passwords, but she started looking through his history, old messages, and even went through his phone when he wasn't there. He's now changing passwords again to have privacy, and she's upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy gave her passwords expecting mutual trust, but she didn't respect his privacy. Even though he said there's nothing to hide, the act of her going through his personal stuff without permission is a problem. Privacy is important in relationships. Just because they're in a relationship doesn't mean everyone should have access to each other's private data. \n\nHe's not hiding something; he's just setting boundaries. The girlfriend is arguing that trust means sharing everything, but trust is about respecting each other's boundaries, not necessarily having access. The fact that she found old stuff from years ago and that he doesn't care, but it's embarrassing, shows he needs personal space. \n\nSo, changing passwords is a reasonable step to protect his privacy. It's his right to have some level of privacy even in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is about not understanding that privacy isn't a lack of trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
