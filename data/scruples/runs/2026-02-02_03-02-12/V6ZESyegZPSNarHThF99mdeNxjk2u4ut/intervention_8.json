I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The scenario involves the girlfriend wanting shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the person feels their privacy is invaded when she goes through their old stuff. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has accessed various personal items on the author's devices\u2014porn history, old Skype messages, pictures, and messages. The author finds this embarrassing and wants more privacy. The author initially gave her the password, assuming there was nothing to hide, but now wants to reclaim privacy by changing passwords. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust is mutual.\n\nSo the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. Trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; it's more about past content they consider irrelevant now. The girlfriend's actions might stem from wanting to show trust, but she's overstepping by prying into old digital content that isn't current. \n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary by changing passwords. That's a reasonable step to protect their privacy. The girlfriend might feel hurt or distrustful, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting privacy, especially when it's about old, non-current content. The key here is mutual respect for each other's privacy. If the author is open and honest about their reasons, it's a valid boundary. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their personal space, which is a healthy aspect of any relationship. The girlfriend's actions were intrusive, so the author's response is justified.\n"
