I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found various things in his browser history, old messages, photos, and even checked his phone when he wasn't around. The author is now changing passwords to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other. The author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend feels that sharing passwords is part of trust. The author did share the password first, and now changing it might seem like a betrayal of trust. But on the other hand, the author is within their right to want privacy. The girlfriend was going through his stuff without consent, which is a problem. The author's actions could be a reasonable response to protect their privacy after experiencing invasion of privacy from the girlfriend.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. Trust is important in a relationship, but so is personal space. If one partner is invading the other's privacy, the response of setting boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. The author might not be at fault because they are trying to reclaim their privacy after the girlfriend breached it. The girlfriend's actions (looking through messages when he wasn't around) are problematic. The author's decision to change passwords is a way to prevent further privacy issues. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're asserting their right to privacy after the girlfriend didn't respect it. The issue here isn't just about passwords but about mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't hiding something malicious; they're trying to protect their personal space.\n"
