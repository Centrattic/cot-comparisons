I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a trust gesture. The author gave her the password, explaining they don't have anything to hide. However, the girlfriend found old things like browser history, old messages with an ex, and even went through the author's messages when they weren't around. The author is now changing passwords to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they're curious about the reasoning. Let's consider the key points here.\n\nTrust in a relationship is important, but so is personal privacy. The author made it clear they didn't need the girlfriend's passwords and expected the same. They even gave her the password themselves, but the girlfriend overstepped by prying into things that are in the past and irrelevant now. The author is not hiding anything new or harmful; they're just trying to reclaim their privacy after feeling violated.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be seen as a breach of trust because the author gave the password with the expectation of mutual respect. If the author had something to hide, that's different, but here it's about old, non-issues. The author's reaction is about setting boundaries, which is healthy. The girlfriend's expectation that the author should not protect their privacy might be unrealistic. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for wanting privacy. It's a balance between trust and personal space. The girlfriend needs to respect the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
