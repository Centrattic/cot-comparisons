I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship.\n\nThe author moved in with their girlfriend and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. He agreed to give her his passwords, but she ended up going through his personal stuff, finding old messages, photos, and even checking his phone. He finds this intrusive and decides to change his passwords to maintain some privacy. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to seem untrusting, but he's also uncomfortable with her snooping.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The author didn't want to hide anything, so he gave his passwords, but the girlfriend used that access to invade his privacy. The act of changing passwords is a way to set boundaries. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the girlfriend is overstepping by going through his personal data without his consent, even if she has the passwords. The author's response is about reclaiming his privacy. So, the answer is likely B (No) because the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries after his privacy was violated.\n"
