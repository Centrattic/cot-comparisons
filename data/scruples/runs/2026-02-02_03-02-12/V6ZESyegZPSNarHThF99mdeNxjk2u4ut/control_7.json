I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together and discussing password sharing. The guy initially gave his girlfriend his password, expecting mutual trust, but then she started going through his stuff, finding old stuff, and he felt the need to take back his privacy by changing the passwords.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust, which is common in some relationships. But the guy had boundaries and didn't want her to access his private information. When she did look into his history, messages, etc., he felt it was a violation of his privacy, even if she had the password. \n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and privacy. In relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The guy might feel that even if he gave the password, he should have boundaries about what's accessed. The girlfriend might feel that since she has the password, she has the right to access his devices. However, accessing his private messages and history without consent, even if she has the password, can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nI should also think about consent. Just because someone has the password doesn't mean they have the right to snoop. The guy might have given the password for practical reasons, not expecting her to go through his private data. The girlfriend's actions might not have been malicious, but she crossed a boundary by looking into his personal stuff.\n\nAnother angle: changing passwords after sharing them could be seen as a betrayal of trust. But if the trust was broken by her snooping, then the guy has a valid reason to protect his privacy. It's a balance between mutual trust and respecting individual privacy.\n\nIn many relationships, people negotiate boundaries. If the guy made it clear that he didn't want her to access his stuff, but she did anyway, then changing the passwords is a reasonable response to protect his privacy. However, if the expectation was that sharing the password meant full access, then he might be in the wrong for taking it back.\n\nBut in this case, the guy had already given the password with the understanding that there was nothing to hide. However, the act of looking through his old data and his messages without a clear reason (other than curiosity) might not be justified. So the guy's decision to change passwords to maintain his privacy is understandable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because privacy is a personal right, and even in a relationship, individuals should have some boundaries. The girlfriend's actions might have overstepped, leading the guy to take back control of his privacy.\n"
