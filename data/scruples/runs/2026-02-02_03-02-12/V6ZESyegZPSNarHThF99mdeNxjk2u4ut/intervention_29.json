I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple moving in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a gesture of trust, but the author was hesitant. They did share the password initially, but after the girlfriend accessed personal data like browser history, old messages, and photos, the author decided to change the passwords to maintain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust is important, but the author wants to keep some boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy in relationships. Trust is crucial, but so is personal space. The author mentioned that there's nothing to hide, but the actions of the girlfriend\u2014going through old conversations, messages, etc.\u2014could be seen as an invasion of privacy. The author's response is to set boundaries by changing passwords, which is a common way to protect personal data.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be a red flag. Even if she had good intentions, accessing someone's private information without permission is generally considered a breach of trust. The author is trying to establish clear boundaries here. The key point is that while sharing passwords can be a sign of trust in some relationships, it's not mandatory. The author isn't hiding anything; they just want to maintain some level of privacy. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author shared the password initially but later changed it suggests a shift in their comfort level. The girlfriend's reaction of being upset might stem from feeling rejected or not trusted, but the author has the right to adjust their boundaries based on their experiences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect their privacy. It's a matter of setting healthy boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions were intrusive, and the author is responding appropriately by limiting access. So the answer should be B.\n"
