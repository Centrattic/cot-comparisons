I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author changed them after she went through his old stuff, making him uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author agreed to share passwords initially, maybe to show trust, but then changed them when they felt their privacy was invaded. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that by sharing passwords, the author was giving her access, so she thought it was okay to look through things. \n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. The author might feel that even though they didn't mind her seeing the content, the act of going through their private messages without consent is a breach of privacy. Changing passwords is a way to set a boundary. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees this as a betrayal of trust, but the author is trying to reclaim their privacy. \n\nI think the author is within their right to set personal boundaries. Just because someone shares passwords doesn't mean they have to keep them open for constant scrutiny. Privacy is important even in relationships. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
