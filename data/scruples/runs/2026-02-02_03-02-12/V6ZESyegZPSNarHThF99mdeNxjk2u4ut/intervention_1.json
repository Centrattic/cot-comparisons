I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author changed their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their computer and phone. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust, but the author didn't like that. They gave her the password initially because they had nothing to hide, but then the girlfriend started going through their stuff, which made the author uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy in relationships. Even when people live together, it's common to have some personal space. The girlfriend is using the shared passwords to access personal data, which the author finds intrusive. The author isn't hiding anything, but the act of going through messages and browser history without consent is a privacy issue. \n\nThe girlfriend argues that trust should mean no secrets, but that's a bit extreme. Trust doesn't mean one has to give up all privacy. The author has the right to set boundaries. The fact that the girlfriend is upset about the password change shows she might be expecting too much access. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or morally wrong by protecting their own devices. They're responding to the invasion of privacy they experienced. Changing passwords is a reasonable step to maintain personal boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
