I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend accessed private information is in the wrong. The situation involves moving in together and sharing passwords as a gesture of trust. The author initially gave the password to the girlfriend, who then found old, private content and started going through his messages.\n\nFirst, trust and privacy in a relationship are key here. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust, but the author felt the need to set boundaries after her actions made him uncomfortable. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the password change is a breach of trust, but the author wants privacy.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a sign of transparency. On the other, everyone has a right to personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions of invading his privacy might justify the author's decision to protect his own information. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just trying to maintain some personal space. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend was going through his phone without his knowledge is a red flag. The author's response is a reasonable step to prevent further invasions. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
