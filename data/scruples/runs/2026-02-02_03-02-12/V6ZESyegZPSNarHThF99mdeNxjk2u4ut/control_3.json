I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple moving in together and the girlfriend wanting shared passwords as a trust thing. The guy gave her his password, but she started finding old stuff from his past, which embarrassed him. Now he's changing the passwords again to keep some privacy. They're both upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The girlfriend's argument is about trust and sharing, which is common in relationships. She probably feels that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. But the guy's side is about privacy. He's allowed to have personal space, even in a relationship. The key here is that he's not hiding anything malicious, just past interactions that aren't relevant now.\n\nHe gave her the password once, and she went through his stuff when he wasn't around. That's where the issue starts. Even if she had access, doing so without explicit permission is a privacy violation. So, his decision to change passwords is a way to protect his privacy after her actions.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally and ethically, individuals have the right to privacy. Relationships require boundaries, and it's healthy to have some. If one person's actions (like going through messages without consent) cross those boundaries, the other has the right to set limits. The guy isn't hiding something bad; he's just maintaining his personal space. Therefore, changing passwords isn't wrong. The problem might be in their communication. They need to discuss boundaries better, but the action itself isn't in the wrong.\n"
