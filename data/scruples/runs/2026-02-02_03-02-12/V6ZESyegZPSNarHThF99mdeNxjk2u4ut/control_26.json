I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the person changed them back after she went through his private stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend asked for shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her access but then found out she was checking his old messages, browsing history, and private photos. He changed the passwords to protect his privacy. She's upset because she thinks trust is mutual, but he feels his privacy is invaded.\n\nThe key points here are trust and privacy. In a relationship, mutual trust is important, but everyone has a right to some personal space. The girlfriend's actions of going through his devices without consent might be crossing a boundary. The author's response is to set boundaries by changing passwords. \n\nIs changing passwords a reasonable act? It seems like he's reclaiming his privacy after feeling violated. The girlfriend's expectation of access might be too much. The author isn't hiding something but just wants privacy for past conversations and data. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his privacy after experiencing intrusion. The girlfriend should respect that. So the answer is B.\n"
