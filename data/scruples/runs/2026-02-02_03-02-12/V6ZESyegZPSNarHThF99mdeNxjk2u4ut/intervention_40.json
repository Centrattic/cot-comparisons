I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed them after she found old stuff in his browser history, old messages, and noticed her looking through his phone. He's now changing the passwords again to maintain privacy, and she's upset about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend wants transparency and trust through shared passwords. On the other, the author is asserting his right to privacy, which is understandable given that she's prying into his past.\n\nKey points: The author didn't hide anything malicious; the stuff found was old and irrelevant. The girlfriend is invading his privacy by checking his messages and apps. The author is setting boundaries to protect his personal information. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but everyone has a right to some privacy. The author isn't hiding anything harmful, just personal history. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, making the author's decision to secure his devices a reasonable response. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
