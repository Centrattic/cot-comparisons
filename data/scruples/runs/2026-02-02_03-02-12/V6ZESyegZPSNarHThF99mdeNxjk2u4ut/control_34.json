I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password because they thought there's nothing to hide, but then the girlfriend started going through their stuff\u2014like finding old messages, pictures, etc. Now the author is changing the passwords to regain some privacy, and the girlfriend is upset because they feel it's a breach of trust.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author is setting boundaries by changing passwords to prevent the girlfriend from accessing their personal data. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that sharing passwords is part of mutual trust, and the author's action is seen as a withdrawal of that trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a right to privacy. Even in a committed relationship, people generally have the right to their personal space and data. The girlfriend's actions of going through old messages and files might be overstepping, especially if she's accessing things that are personal and from the past. The author is reacting to being uncomfortable with their privacy invaded, so changing passwords to prevent further intrusion seems like a reasonable step.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and mutual agreement. The author gave the password once, but the girlfriend continued to access information without permission. The author is now taking steps to protect their privacy, which is their right. The girlfriend's expectation that they should share access might not be healthy if it's leading to one party feeling violated.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that trust is important, and she might feel hurt that the author is now limiting access. But trust should be about respecting each other's boundaries, not about unrestricted access. If the author feels the need to set those boundaries after the initial access was intrusive, that's more about self-respect and personal space than a lack of trust.\n\nI think the author is justified in changing passwords to maintain privacy. The girlfriend's actions were invasive, and the author's response is a healthy boundary. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
