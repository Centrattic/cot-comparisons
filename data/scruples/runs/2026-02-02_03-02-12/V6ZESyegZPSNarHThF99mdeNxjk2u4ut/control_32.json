I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend moving in together and wanting to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it when he noticed she was going through his private stuff. Now, he's conflicted because she's upset and claims they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of relationships, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and finding old stuff might make the author feel violated. Even though he said there's nothing to hide, the intrusion into his past conversations and history could be uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points: The author gave her the password voluntarily at first but later changed it when he found out she was accessing his private information. He's not hiding anything malicious; it's more about privacy. The girlfriend feels betrayed by changing the password, seeing it as a lack of trust. But the author is asserting his right to privacy after her actions. \n\nIn many relationships, boundaries around privacy can be tricky. While sharing passwords might be part of some couples' routines, it's not the only way to show trust. The author has a right to personal space, especially if the other person is overstepping. The girlfriend's behavior of invading privacy, even unintentionally, justifies the author's decision to set boundaries. So, it's about mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting his privacy after her actions. The answer should be B.\n"
