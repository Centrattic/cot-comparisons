I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the boyfriend and girlfriend moved in together and there's been some tension around sharing passwords and privacy.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password but then felt uncomfortable when she started going through his stuff, like old conversations, porn history, and messages. Now he's changing his passwords again to keep his privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels they should trust each other.\n\nSo the main question is whether the guy is wrong to do this. Let's think about the key points here. The guy initially gave his password, but then the girlfriend started accessing his private data without his consent. Even if she had a password, going through his messages and apps without permission is a privacy violation. He has a right to his personal space and privacy, even in a relationship. Changing passwords to prevent unauthorized access is a reasonable way to protect that privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is a way to show trust. But trust shouldn't mean giving up your privacy. The guy is setting boundaries, which is important. If the girlfriend is going through his stuff, that's a red flag. He's not hiding anything; he's just reclaiming his right to privacy. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's not hiding anything but still wants privacy is valid. People should be allowed to have personal information without fear of being judged or having their past actions scrutinized. The girl's reaction might indicate insecurity or a lack of respect for his boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's privacy. If the girlfriend can't respect that, then maybe there's a bigger issue. The guy is taking a stand to protect his personal space, which is reasonable. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
