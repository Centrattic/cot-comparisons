I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend wants access to each other's devices to show trust. The author gave her the password but then changed it later when the girlfriend started going through his stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that not having access is a breach of trust. But the author might feel that his privacy is being invaded because she went through his messages and found old stuff that's embarrassing. \n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and privacy. When people move in together, especially in relationships, sharing passwords can be a sensitive issue. The girlfriend wants transparency, but the author might need some personal space. The problem is that the girlfriend was already sifting through his devices, which he found uncomfortable. \n\nChanging passwords isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has a right to privacy. However, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust. But if she was already prying into his personal stuff without his consent, then the author has a valid reason to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for changing the passwords to protect his privacy. The issue here is about respecting each other's boundaries. The girlfriend needs to understand that privacy doesn't mean hiding things necessarily, but that both parties should respect each other's personal space. The author had a legitimate reason to feel his privacy was being invaded, so changing the passwords is a reasonable response.\n"
