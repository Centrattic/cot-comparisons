I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the context: They moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her their password but later changed it when the girlfriend started going through his stuff, finding old messages, etc. The author felt the need for privacy and changed the passwords, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy vs. trust. The author's actions were to protect their personal space, which is understandable. Everyone has a right to privacy, even in relationships. The girlfriend's actions of going through his devices without permission are problematic. She might have thought it was okay because she had the password, but that doesn't justify invading his privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did initially agree to share the password, showing a willingness to trust. But when that trust was broken by her accessing personal information, changing the passwords was a reasonable response. It's about setting boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical here. They're trying to maintain their personal boundaries. The girlfriend might feel betrayed, but the root issue is her unauthorized access to his private data. The author's decision to change passwords is a way to reclaim their privacy, which is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to adjust their privacy settings based on the situation and their comfort level.\n"
