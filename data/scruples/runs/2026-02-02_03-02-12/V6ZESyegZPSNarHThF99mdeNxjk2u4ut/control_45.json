I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to prevent the girlfriend from accessing his devices after she's been going through his personal stuff. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the author was okay sharing his passwords but expected the same from her. However, she found some old stuff like browser history, Skype chats, old phone pics, and even went through his messages. The author changed passwords to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust is important.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing that. The author's reasoning is about privacy, while the girlfriend sees it as a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries and trust are both important. The fact that the girlfriend was invading his privacy by looking through his messages and old files might justify the author wanting to set boundaries. Even if they agreed to share passwords, mutual respect for privacy should still exist. \n\nThe author isn't hiding anything; he's just protecting his past, which is normal. The girlfriend's actions were intruding on his personal space, so changing passwords to prevent further intrusion could be seen as a reasonable step. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain some level of privacy, especially since the girlfriend was the one initiating the prying. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
