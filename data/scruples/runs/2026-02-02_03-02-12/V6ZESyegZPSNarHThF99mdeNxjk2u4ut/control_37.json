I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The scenario involves the girlfriend wanting to share passwords as a sign of trust, but when she does access the author's devices, she finds old, personal stuff that embarrasses him. He decides to change the passwords to maintain privacy, and she's upset, thinking it's a breach of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author initially gave the password, but later changed it after experiencing privacy invasions. The main conflict is about boundaries and trust in a relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords shows trust, and she's upset when the author withdraws this. However, the author feels that their privacy is being violated when the girlfriend goes through their personal data without permission. \n\nIn relationships, trust and privacy can be a balancing act. While sharing passwords might be a gesture of openness, it doesn't necessarily mean one should have unrestricted access to each other's personal data. The author's actions could be seen as reclaiming their right to privacy, especially when the access led to uncomfortable situations. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, by giving the password initially, he allowed access. Changing it might be seen as breaking that trust. However, if the access was used to invade his privacy (going through messages without reason), then setting boundaries by changing passwords is reasonable. \n\nThe key here is that the girlfriend used the shared password to access personal information without the author's consent, which is a privacy issue. The author's response is to protect their privacy, which is a valid action. The girlfriend's expectation of trust shouldn't override the individual's right to personal privacy. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain their privacy after the initial access led to discomfort. The answer should be B (No).\n"
