I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend wanting access to their devices, and the author changed the passwords to maintain privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels there's a lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author gave the girlfriend their password initially but later changed it, not because there was something to hide, but to protect their privacy. The girlfriend accessed personal stuff like browser history, old messages, and photos, which made the author uncomfortable. The author's main issue isn't about hiding something but about privacy and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is individual privacy. The author might feel that sharing passwords isn't necessary for trust. The girlfriend's actions of going through private information could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author changing passwords is a way to set those boundaries, which is a reasonable action. They're not hiding anything but simply asserting their right to privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that they should trust each other might overlook the fact that trust doesn't mean unlimited access to each other's private data. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author's actions are about maintaining that respect. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're protecting their personal space, which is valid.\n"
