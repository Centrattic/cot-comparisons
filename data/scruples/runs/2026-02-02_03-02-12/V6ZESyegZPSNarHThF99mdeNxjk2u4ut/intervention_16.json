I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access to their devices as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password because they had nothing to hide, but the girlfriend started going through old messages, browsing history, and other personal stuff. The author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, it's their privacy and they want to change the passwords to maintain some personal space.\n\nSo the main points here are consent and boundaries. The girlfriend didn't ask for permission each time she accessed the devices, which can be seen as a violation of the author's privacy. Even if there's no malicious intent, the act of going through someone's old messages and browsing history without their current consent might be overstepping. The author is setting boundaries by changing passwords, which is a reasonable action to protect their privacy. Trust in a relationship doesn't mean someone has a right to access all of each other's personal devices without limits. So, it seems like the author is justified in their actions. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
