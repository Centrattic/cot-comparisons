I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The writer moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The writer gave her the password but later changed it after the girlfriend went through his stuff.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about privacy versus trust. The girlfriend felt they should share passwords to show trust, but the writer didn't want to give her access. However, he did give her the password at first. Now, after some instances of her going through his things without his consent, he changed his passwords. \n\nSo, the question is: Is the writer wrong for doing this? Well, trust is important in a relationship, but so is privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and finding old stuff that's irrelevant might have made the writer feel that his privacy is being invaded. \n\nFrom the writer's perspective, changing passwords is a way to protect his privacy. He's not hiding anything serious, just old stuff that's not relevant anymore. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels this is a breach of trust. But the writer might feel that mutual respect for privacy is important. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are key. If both parties agreed to some level of transparency, but the girlfriend overstepped by going through private messages, then the writer is within his rights to set boundaries. However, if the initial agreement was mutual password sharing, changing it later might feel like breaking that trust. \n\nBut the girlfriend's actions might have pushed the writer to reevaluate. He might have realized that even if he gave her the password, it's not the same as her respecting his privacy by not going through his things. The writer's decision to change passwords could be seen as a necessary step to maintain his boundaries. \n\nSo, considering that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after experiencing privacy violations from his girlfriend.\n"
