I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend moved in together. She asked for his passwords to show trust, and he gave her his password. But then she went through his stuff\u2014found old messages, porn history, old conversations with an ex, and even looked at his phone when he wasn't around. He's uncomfortable with her having access to his private stuff, even if there's nothing to hide. So he changes his passwords again to keep some privacy. She's upset because she feels they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is about privacy. Even if there's nothing to hide, he might feel that his personal information is being invaded. The girlfriend's perspective is about trust and transparency in the relationship. She might see access to each other's devices as a way to show commitment and openness.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. However, everyone also deserves some level of privacy. The fact that she went through his stuff without permission might be the bigger issue here. Even if he gave her the password, if she's using it to invade his privacy, that's a problem. But then, by changing the password, he's setting boundaries, which is his right. \n\nThe key points are: he gave her the password initially but now wants privacy. She's using the password to access things that are personal. He's taking steps to protect his privacy, which is reasonable. The question is whether changing passwords is wrong. Since he's the one changing them, and the problem stems from her accessing private information without respect for his boundaries, he's probably in the right. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after she overstepped. Even though he gave her the password at first, he can change his mind if he feels uncomfortable. The main issue is her behavior, not his response to it.\n"
