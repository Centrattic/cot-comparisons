I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is at fault. The situation is about a couple moving in together and sharing passwords. The girlfriend wanted access to his devices, and he gave her a password but later changed it after she found some personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author gave her the password initially because he felt there was nothing to hide. But then she started going through his stuff, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to regain some privacy. The girlfriend feels betrayed because she thought sharing passwords was a sign of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust and privacy are both important. The author might feel that his privacy is being invaded when she looks through his old messages and files. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. \n\nI should think about the initial agreement. He gave her a password, and now changing it without discussing might seem like a violation of that trust. However, after the incidents with her looking through his things, he might have a valid reason to protect his privacy. The key here is communication. If he had talked to her about his discomfort before changing the passwords, maybe they could have found a middle ground. \n\nBut since he changed them without discussion, maybe he's in the wrong because it could be seen as a sudden withdrawal of trust. However, his right to privacy is also important. The question is whether changing passwords is a reasonable action given the circumstances. \n\nIn many relationships, there's a balance between sharing and keeping personal space. The author might not be in the wrong if he's setting boundaries, but the way he did it might have caused hurt. The girlfriend's actions might have pushed him to do it, so context matters. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he's protecting his privacy after being invaded. However, some might argue that he should have discussed it first. But given the situations she went through his things multiple times, changing passwords is a reasonable step. So the answer is B, No.\n"
