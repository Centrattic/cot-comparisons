I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is at fault. The situation is that the boyfriend and girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the guy didn't care about her passwords. He gave her his initially because he had nothing to hide. But then she went through his stuff\u2014found old browser history, messages, pics, etc. He changed his passwords now to maintain privacy, and she's upset.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks for whether the person's actions are unreasonable. The guy's main point is that he wants privacy even though he's in a relationship. The girlfriend expected trust through shared access, which is a common expectation in relationships, but the guy feels that his privacy is being invaded when she goes through his old data and messages. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust, and if he willingly gave her the password, maybe he implicitly agreed to her access. On the other hand, she's going through his past data, which he might consider private. Even if there's nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy can be uncomfortable. The guy's reaction is to change passwords to protect his privacy, which is a reasonable step. \n\nBut the girlfriend sees this as a breach of trust. So where's the line? In relationships, boundaries can vary. Some people expect certain levels of privacy, others see shared access as part of transparency. The key points here are that he didn't force her to have access, he gave it to her, but then she started going through his stuff. His response is to take back privacy, which is a basic right. \n\nI think the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because maintaining privacy is reasonable, even in a relationship. Just because someone is in a relationship doesn't mean they have to give up all privacy. The girlfriend might need to respect that boundary. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
