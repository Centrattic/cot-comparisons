I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her his password because he had nothing to hide. However, she then found old stuff like porn history, old messages, and even went through his phone. He found this embarrassing and decided to change his passwords, which upset her because she felt they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author is trying to balance his right to privacy with the expectations of trust. The girlfriend expects transparency as a sign of commitment, but the author's privacy is being invaded when she goes through his personal data. \n\nThe key points to consider: \n1. The author initially shared the password willingly but later changed it after privacy breaches.\n2. The girlfriend is going through his private data without consent, which is a problem.\n3. The author's action is to reclaim his privacy, which is reasonable given her behavior.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and boundaries are important. While trust is crucial, it doesn't mean all personal spaces should be open. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other having access, especially after privacy violations, it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be crossing into invasive territory by searching through old, irrelevant content and accessing devices without permission. The author is not hiding anything malicious but wants to maintain personal privacy, which is a valid concern. \n\nTherefore, changing the password to prevent further invasions of privacy is not in the wrong. The author has the right to protect his personal information, especially after experiencing breaches. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to feeling betrayed, but the root issue is about respecting personal boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
