I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting to share passwords as a sign of trust, but when the author gave her the password, she started going through his personal stuff.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they didn't want her password, but gave her their own. The girlfriend then found various things like porn history, old Skype chats, and photos. The author changed passwords to protect privacy, which led to conflict.\n\nFrom a privacy perspective, people have a right to personal space, even in relationships. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through messages and apps\u2014could be seen as invasive. The author's response is to set boundaries by changing passwords. While sharing passwords can be a trust issue, the girlfriend's behavior crossed into respecting the author's privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious, just protecting past content that's irrelevant now. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
