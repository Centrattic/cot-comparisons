I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple moving in together and the girlfriend wanting to share passwords to show trust. The author gave her his passwords but later changed them when she started looking through his stuff, which he found intrusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: she might feel that sharing passwords is a sign of trust and openness in a relationship. She probably thought it was normal and healthy to have access to each other's devices, especially since they live together now. She might see the password change as a betrayal of trust or a lack of transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to maintain some privacy. Even though he gave her the password initially, he changed it later because he felt his privacy was being invaded. He mentions that she found old, irrelevant information and that she was going through his messages. This could make him uncomfortable, and changing the password is a way to set boundaries.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong by changing the passwords. The girlfriend might argue that trust requires transparency, but the author is asserting his right to privacy. In relationships, trust is important, but so is respecting individual boundaries. It's possible that the author is justified in wanting to protect his personal data, especially if he's not comfortable with her looking through his phone or computer without his consent.\n\nAnother angle: the initial agreement to share passwords might have been mutual, but the author changed his mind. However, changing a password after agreeing to share could be seen as breaking that trust. But if the other person was using the access in a way that made him uncomfortable, then maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the content she found (old messages, porn history) might be embarrassing but not harmful. The author's issue is about privacy, not about hiding something harmful. So, his desire to protect his privacy is valid. However, in a trusting relationship, expecting that the other person won't snoop through personal information is part of mutual respect.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to protect his privacy after feeling his boundaries were crossed. While sharing passwords can show trust, it shouldn't come at the cost of allowing intrusion into personal matters. The author's action to change passwords is a way to reclaim his privacy, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
