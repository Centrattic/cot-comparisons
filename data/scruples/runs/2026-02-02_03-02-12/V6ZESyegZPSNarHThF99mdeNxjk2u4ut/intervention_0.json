I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after the girlfriend went through his stuff, found old stuff like porn history, old conversations, and saw her checking his messages. The author felt embarrassed and wanted privacy, so they changed the passwords. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They gave the password initially because there's nothing to hide, but after the girlfriend invaded their privacy by looking through personal stuff, they decided to protect their privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want personal space. Changing passwords is a way to set boundaries and protect past communications that are irrelevant now. The fact that the girlfriend is going through his devices without consent is a privacy violation. So the author's action is a response to that.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She might feel that changing passwords is a sign of distrust, even if the author claims it's about privacy. She might see sharing passwords as a gesture of trust, and the author's withdrawal could be seen as breaking that trust. However, the key point here is that the author was the one who was invaded first. The girlfriend's actions of snooping without permission are the initial transgression.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for privacy. The author isn't hiding anything new; they're protecting old, irrelevant data. The act of changing passwords here is a reasonable step to prevent further invasion of privacy. The girlfriend's behavior of checking messages without consent is problematic, so the author's action is a justified boundary.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after the other person violated it. The answer should be B.\n"
