I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The writer moved in with their girlfriend and initially gave her their passwords because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend started going through old messages, photos, and other personal stuff, which embarrassed the writer. So they decided to change their passwords to regain some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend seems to believe that sharing passwords is a sign of trust, which is a common perspective in relationships. But the writer is asserting their right to privacy. The key here is the concept of mutual respect in relationships. Trust and privacy can sometimes conflict, and finding a balance is important.\n\nThe writer gave the passwords initially, but the girlfriend's actions (like looking through old messages and finding personal stuff) made the writer uncomfortable. Even if the girlfriend didn't mean to invade privacy, the actions caused embarrassment. The writer's response was to set boundaries by changing passwords. \n\nIn relationships, consent and boundaries are crucial. If the writer felt that their privacy was being invaded, it's reasonable for them to take steps to protect it. The girlfriend might see it as a breach of trust, but the writer's intent was to maintain their own privacy. \n\nI think the writer isn't in the wrong because they're establishing personal boundaries, which is healthy. The girlfriend might need to respect that unless they agreed to a different arrangement. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
