I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her his password because he felt there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend went through his browser history, old messages, and even his phone when he wasn't around. The author now wants to change passwords to regain some privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo the core issue here is about privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The author is asserting his right to privacy by changing passwords, while the girlfriend feels that trust requires sharing access.\n\nFrom a general perspective, people often have different boundaries regarding privacy. It's common for individuals to want some level of personal space, even in relationships. The author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful; it's more about past interactions and personal history. The fact that the girlfriend went through his devices without his consent might indicate a boundary issue on her part. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's expectation of password sharing could stem from a desire for openness and trust. But trust doesn't necessarily mean giving someone unrestricted access to all your personal data, especially if it leads to invasion of privacy. The author's actions are about setting boundaries, which is a healthy aspect in any relationship.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect for each other's privacy and communication. The author isn't wrong for wanting privacy. The problem might be that both sides have different expectations. The author's response is a reasonable step to protect his personal space after feeling his boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in her perspective, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting these limits.\n"
