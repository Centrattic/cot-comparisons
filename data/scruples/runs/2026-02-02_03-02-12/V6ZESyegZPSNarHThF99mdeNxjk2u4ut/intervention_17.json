I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation is that they moved in with their girlfriend, who wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password because they had nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend accessed old, personal stuff like porn history, Skype conversations with an ex, and private messages. The author is now changing passwords to maintain privacy, which is making the girlfriend upset. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author gave the password expecting mutual trust, but the girlfriend used it to access past, private content. The author feels that their privacy was invaded, even though they had nothing to hide. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nTrust in a relationship is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping because even if there's nothing to hide, accessing someone's past private data without explicit permission can be a breach of trust. The author is reclaiming their privacy by changing passwords, which is a reasonable step. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being dishonest or secretive by changing the passwords. But the author's reasoning is about maintaining boundaries, not hiding anything new. They might not want to share their current passwords but are okay with the old ones. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing passwords isn't a given and can be a sensitive issue. The fact that the author gave them initially but now wants to take back control is about respecting their own limits. The girlfriend's actions could be a sign of insecurity or lack of respect for the author's privacy. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for setting these boundaries. Changing passwords is a way to protect personal information and privacy, which is a valid right. The answer should be B.\n"
