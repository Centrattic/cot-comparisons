I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password because he felt there was nothing to hide, but then she started going through his stuff\u2014finding old conversations, pictures, etc. Now he's changing the passwords again to maintain privacy, and she's upset because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy versus trust. The guy initially shared his password, which he thought was okay because he had nothing to hide. However, he realized that even if there's nothing to hide, the act of someone going through his personal data (even old stuff) was making him uncomfortable. He wants to set boundaries for his privacy. \n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, people have the right to control access to their personal devices. Even in a relationship, mutual respect should involve understanding each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of prying into his past, even if she found nothing harmful, could be seen as overstepping. The guy's change in passwords is a way to protect his privacy, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since they're in a committed relationship, full transparency is expected. But trust doesn't necessarily mean unlimited access. The guy's decision to set boundaries isn't about hiding things now but about respecting his own comfort level with privacy.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the guy isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy, which is healthy. The issue might be more about communication\u2014both parties need to discuss their expectations and boundaries. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
