I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and girlfriend moved in together. She wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found some personal stuff like old conversations, photos, and even went through messages. The author now wants to change passwords to maintain privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, thinking they should trust each other fully.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and privacy. The author gave up their password once, but the girlfriend used it to access private information. The author is now setting boundaries to protect their privacy, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is mutual respect for personal space. The girlfriend might feel that the passwords were shared for transparency, but the author has a right to their privacy. The fact that the author didn't hide their password initially shows trust, but the girlfriend's actions (looking through messages, finding old stuff) might infringe on that privacy.\n\nThe author's decision to change the password isn't about hiding things but about setting boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not agree with those boundaries, but the author has every right to do so. It's about balancing trust with personal privacy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect their privacy after the initial trust was tested by the girlfriend's actions. The answer should be B.\n"
