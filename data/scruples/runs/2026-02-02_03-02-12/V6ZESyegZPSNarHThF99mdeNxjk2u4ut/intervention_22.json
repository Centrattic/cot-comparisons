I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password, but then the girlfriend went through his history, messages, etc., which made him uncomfortable. So he changed the passwords, and she's upset because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of personal privacy in a relationship. Trust is important, but so is individual privacy. The key point here is whether the author had a right to set boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and history could be seen as a violation of his privacy, even if she had the password. If the author is uncomfortable with that, changing the passwords is a reasonable step to maintain his own privacy.\n\nI should also think about the mutual aspect. The author didn't ask for her password, which shows he respects her privacy. But she wanted his, and then used that access to invade his privacy. Changing passwords is a way to protect one's own personal space. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong here. \n\nAnother angle: in relationships, people have different expectations. The girlfriend might see shared passwords as a norm, but the author's discomfort with her going through his data is valid. The problem arises when she accesses private info without his consent, even if she has the password. The author's action is about reclaiming that privacy.\n\nBut some might argue that if you give someone your password, you're implicitly allowing access. However, that's a gray area. People might give passwords for specific reasons, not expecting their entire history to be combed through. The author might not have consented to such thorough access. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is setting boundaries to protect his privacy after feeling his privacy was invaded. That makes sense. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
