I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to keep a girlfriend from accessing their devices. The key points here are about privacy, trust, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThe author initially agreed to share their password, which shows some level of openness. But then the girlfriend started prying into past things that were found on his devices. The author feels that while there's nothing to hide now, the invasion of privacy is uncomfortable. They want to set boundaries by changing passwords again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of mutual trust. The girlfriend argues that sharing passwords is a sign of trust. However, the author is asserting their right to privacy, which is also a valid concern. Relationships often require a balance between trust and personal space. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages and old data\u2014might be seen as overstepping, even if she had the password. The author is trying to reclaim their privacy without necessarily hiding anything. It's about feeling respected and not having past interactions scrutinized without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel betrayed by the password change, interpreting it as a lack of trust. But the author's justification is about maintaining personal boundaries, which is reasonable. The fact that the author was upfront about their discomfort from the start shows they were honest. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't wrong for seeking privacy. Relationships should have open communication about boundaries. The girlfriend needs to respect those boundaries, and the author is within their rights to set them. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
