I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords. So the situation is about a couple moving in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The guy initially gave his password but later changed it after she found some personal stuff from his past. Now she's upset, arguing they should trust each other, and he's wondering if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The main issue here is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The guy is setting boundaries by changing passwords to maintain his privacy. The girlfriend feels betrayed because she thought sharing passwords was part of mutual trust. \n\nSo, who's right? Well, in relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. Everyone has a right to some level of personal space. The guy isn't hiding secrets but wants to keep certain things private, especially old, irrelevant stuff. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that not sharing passwords is a lack of trust. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The guy didn't hide anything malicious; he just wants to protect his past. He did communicate his discomfort after she went through his messages. Changing the password isn't about hiding something new but preventing past issues from being an ongoing problem. \n\nOn the flip side, mutual trust often involves transparency. If both agreed to share passwords, then changing it might break that agreement. However, the original agreement wasn't mutual since he only gave his password under her request, not expecting her to access everything. \n\nAlso, the fact that she went through his phone without his consent is a red flag. Invasion of privacy, even in a relationship, can be problematic. So his response to set boundaries by changing passwords could be seen as a reasonable step to protect his privacy after her actions made him uncomfortable. \n\nSo putting it all together, the guy isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect his personal space. The issue is more about setting healthy boundaries rather than a lack of trust. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
