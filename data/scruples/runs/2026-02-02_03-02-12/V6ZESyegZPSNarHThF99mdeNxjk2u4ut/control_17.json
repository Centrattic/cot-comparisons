I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their private stuff. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend moved in together. She asked for shared passwords to demonstrate trust. The author initially gave her the password because there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend then looked into past stuff like browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex, and pictures on an old phone. The author also noticed she was checking their messages and apps. The author now wants to change passwords to maintain privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, thinking they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy, trust, and boundaries in a relationship. The author gave the password once, maybe thinking it was a one-time thing, but the girlfriend continued to access private information. The author is now setting a boundary to protect their privacy, which is a common concern in relationships. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing passwords can be a sensitive topic. While some couples might agree to share everything, others value personal privacy. The author's discomfort with their past being pried into, even if it's not relevant now, is valid. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as intrusive, especially if she's doing it without permission. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by changing the passwords. If the author felt that their privacy was being invaded, then setting boundaries by changing passwords isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author should communicate this clearly to the girlfriend, explaining why it's important. The girlfriend's expectation of access might stem from a different view on relationship transparency, but that doesn't mean the author has to comply if it makes them uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did give the password initially, so maybe the girlfriend thought it was an open invitation. But the author is entitled to change their mind if they feel their privacy is being overstepped. It's about mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't being secretive for no reason; they're reclaiming their privacy after realizing the potential for invasion. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries regarding their personal devices and information, even in a trusting relationship. The girlfriend's actions might be compromising the author's privacy, so changing passwords is a reasonable step to protect their personal space.\n"
