I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The writer initially gave her the password because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found old, embarrassing stuff like browser history, old conversations, and photos, and even snooped through their messages when they weren't around. The writer then decided to change passwords to maintain privacy, which upset the girlfriend who felt it was a breach of trust.\n\nNow, the key points here. The writer's actions were to protect their privacy after the girlfriend's behavior made them uncomfortable. The girlfriend's argument is about trust, but she's the one who invaded the writer's privacy. The writer isn't hiding anything; they're just setting boundaries. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping, and the writer is responding to that by taking back their privacy. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but mutual respect for personal boundaries is also crucial. The writer isn't doing anything malicious by changing passwords; they're asserting their right to privacy. The girlfriend's expectation of sharing passwords might have been reasonable, but she crossed a line by going through the writer's personal data without consent. The writer's response is a reasonable boundary-setting action. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the writer is protecting their privacy after experiencing intrusion from their partner. The girlfriend's actions were the issue, not the writer's response.\n"
