I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared access as a trust gesture, but then going through personal items like browser history, old messages, and even phone apps when the author isn't around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy in relationships. Even in committed relationships, individuals generally have a right to some level of privacy. The author provided the password initially because they felt there was nothing to hide, but now they're setting boundaries after the girlfriend overstepped by accessing personal data without permission.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through old messages, checking messages when the author isn't present\u2014could be seen as invasive. The author is now taking steps to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable response to feeling their boundaries were crossed. \n\nTrust is important, but mutual respect for each other's privacy is also crucial. The author isn't hiding something malicious; they're trying to maintain personal space. The fact that the girlfriend is upset about the password change suggests she might not be respecting the author's need for privacy, even after the initial overreach.\n\nSo, the author's actions are about re-establishing boundaries after their privacy was violated. That makes me lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
