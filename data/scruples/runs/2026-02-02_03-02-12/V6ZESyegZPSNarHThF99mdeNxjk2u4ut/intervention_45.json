I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation involves a girlfriend who wanted shared access to their devices and passwords, and the author changed their passwords after she went through their private stuff. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wanted transparency, which she sees as a sign of trust. The author, on the other hand, feels that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend looks through their past conversations and files. They changed the passwords to protect their privacy, which they feel is reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend might feel hurt because the password change seems like a lack of trust. But the author has a valid point about their right to privacy. They mentioned that there's nothing to hide, but the act of going through their phone and computer without permission is what's causing discomfort.\n\nI should think about societal norms. Some people might argue that in a committed relationship, sharing passwords shows trust. However, others might say that everyone deserves a degree of privacy, even in a relationship. The key here is consent. The author gave the password, but the girlfriend used it to look through private content without permission, which is a breach of trust. \n\nThe author's response is to protect their privacy by changing passwords. This is a reasonable action to prevent further invasions of privacy. It's not about hiding something but about setting boundaries. The girlfriend's expectation of access without permission is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, putting it together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after repeated invasions. The answer should be B.\n"
