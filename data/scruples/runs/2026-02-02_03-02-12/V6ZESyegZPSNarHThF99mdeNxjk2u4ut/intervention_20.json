I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who wants shared access to each other's devices as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password initially but later changed it when the girlfriend started going through his private data.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy in relationships. While trust is important, everyone has a right to some level of privacy. The girlfriend's actions of checking his messages and looking through his devices without permission cross a boundary. Even if there's nothing to hide, the act of going through someone's personal data without consent can be seen as intrusive.\n\nThe author's decision to change the passwords is a way to reclaim their privacy. The girlfriend's expectation that trust means full access might be unrealistic. Trust doesn't necessarily mean allowing someone to have unrestricted access to all personal information. There's a difference between being transparent and having your privacy respected.\n\nAlso, the examples given\u2014like finding old Skype conversations and pictures from a packed-away phone\u2014show that the girlfriend is prying into things that are past and not relevant now. The author's discomfort is valid because those are personal memories or data that shouldn't be accessed without permission.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel hurt or mistrustful if the passwords are changed. It's important to communicate boundaries clearly. The author did mention wanting privacy, but maybe they need to explain better why it's necessary. Still, the act of changing passwords isn't inherently wrong; it's a self-protective measure.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here. The author is not doing something wrong by protecting their own privacy. So the answer should be B.\n"
