I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author didn't want to share. The author did give her the password initially because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found some personal stuff from the past, which embarrassed the author, and now the author wants to change the passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean no secrets.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The author's main reason is to maintain personal privacy, which is a valid concern. Everyone has a right to some personal space, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions of going through the author's messages and finding old stuff are invasive. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; it's just old, irrelevant content. The fact that the author felt the need to change passwords after the invasion is a reaction to protect their privacy. The girlfriend might feel that trust is being compromised, but the author isn't hiding anything harmful\u2014just personal history. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries to protect their privacy. It's reasonable to have some separation in a relationship. The girlfriend might need to respect that. So the answer should be B.\n"
