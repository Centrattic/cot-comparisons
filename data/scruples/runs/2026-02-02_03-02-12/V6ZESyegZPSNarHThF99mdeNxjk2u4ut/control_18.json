I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nThe main points from the story: The person and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The person gave her the password but then later, the girlfriend found things like browser history, old conversations, and even went through his messages. The person feels that even though there's nothing to hide, the privacy of past stuff is important, so they changed the passwords. The girlfriend is upset, saying it's about trust.\n\nSo the question is, is the author at fault (A) or not (B)? \n\nFirst, the concept of privacy in relationships. While sharing passwords can be a way to show trust, it's not mandatory. Everyone has the right to some level of privacy. The girlfriend was going through the person's private data without consent, which is a violation of boundaries. The person had the right to set boundaries, especially after experiencing the invasion of privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend's arguments about trust are valid in some contexts, but trust should also involve respecting each other's privacy. The person isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful; it's just personal history. Changing the passwords is a reasonable response to protect one's privacy after being disrespected.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The person made it clear they didn't want the girlfriend's passwords, which shows they respected her privacy. However, the girlfriend didn't reciprocate that respect. The author is taking steps to maintain their own privacy, which is their right. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
