I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The author moved in together and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her their password, but the girlfriend started prying into things like browser history, old messages, and even snooped through the phone when she found it open. The author is now changing the passwords to maintain privacy and is being accused of not trusting her. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship. The girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords, which the author did, but then she used that access to invade the author's privacy. The author is now trying to set boundaries to protect their personal space. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy is important. Even in committed relationships, people may have different comfort levels with sharing access. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through old messages, finding inappropriate content, and snooping when she finds the phone open\u2014indicate a possible lack of respect for boundaries. The author's response of changing passwords is a way to reclaim their privacy, which is a reasonable action. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that they should trust each other is valid, but trust shouldn't mean unlimited access to each other's personal data without consent. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just wanting to keep certain things private. The fact that the author was upfront about their reasons for not wanting to share passwords initially shows they value honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she perceived the password change as a betrayal of trust. However, the author's actions are more about setting personal boundaries rather than breaking trust. It's a balance between trust and respecting individual privacy. \n\nIn many cases, experts suggest that individuals in a relationship should have the right to maintain some level of privacy. The key is communication. The author's approach might have been abrupt, but their intention is to protect their personal space. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded, but her snooping is the initial issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after the girlfriend overstepped. The real problem lies in the girlfriend's actions of prying into private matters without consent. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
