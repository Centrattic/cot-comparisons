I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted access to the author's devices to show trust, but the author now changed the passwords after the girlfriend snooped through his stuff.\n\nFirst, the author initially gave his password to the girlfriend, thinking there's nothing to hide. But then she found some personal stuff from the past, like old messages, Skype conversations, and pictures. He feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so he changes the passwords. The girlfriend is upset, thinking they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy versus trust. The author is setting boundaries to protect his privacy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel betrayed because he took away access after giving it willingly. But the problem started because she invaded his privacy, not the other way around. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong. Everyone deserves some personal space and privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions of snooping were the issue. Changing passwords is a legitimate way to reclaim that privacy. It's not about hiding things but about respecting boundaries. The author made it clear he didn't want her to access his stuff without permission, but she kept doing it. So, the author is protecting his own privacy, which is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
