I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but now, after the girlfriend found some old stuff (porn, old messages, ex's messages, etc.), he changed the passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The author is concerned about their past being dug up, even though they're not hiding anything. They feel entitled to some privacy, especially regarding old, irrelevant data. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see password sharing as a mutual agreement and changing passwords as a violation of that trust.\n\nI should consider societal norms and relationship dynamics. Some people believe that in a committed relationship, sharing passwords is a sign of transparency. However, others argue that everyone has the right to personal privacy, even in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just protecting old, non-relevant content.\n\nThe author's actions are about maintaining personal boundaries. Even though they initially shared the password, they have the right to change their mind if they feel uncomfortable. The girlfriend's intrusion into private messages and apps might have pushed the author to set clearer boundaries. \n\nIt's also important to note that the author isn't keeping secrets that affect their current relationship. The content found was from the past and doesn't impact their current relationship. Therefore, the author's need for privacy isn't unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of relationship advice, communication is key. The author should explain their need for privacy and set boundaries, but changing passwords is a reasonable step to enforce those boundaries after experiencing unwanted intrusion.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They are protecting their privacy in a healthy way after mutual trust was breached by the girlfriend's actions.\n"
