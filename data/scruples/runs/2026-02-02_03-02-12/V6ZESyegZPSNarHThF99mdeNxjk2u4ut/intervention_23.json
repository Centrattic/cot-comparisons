I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a show of trust. The author was okay giving her the password but didn't reciprocate because they didn't see a reason to access her stuff. However, once she had access, she went through his browser history, old messages, photos, and even checked his phone when he wasn't around. The author found this invasive and changed the passwords to regain privacy, which led to arguments about trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries, trust, and mutual respect. The author initially agreed to share the password but now feels that their privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees the password change as a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. Just because someone agrees to share passwords doesn't mean they should have unrestricted access to every piece of personal data, especially old stuff that's not relevant anymore. The author's actions to set boundaries by changing passwords might be a reasonable step to protect their privacy. The girlfriend's behavior of snooping through messages and photos without permission is a red flag for trust issues. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. The author did inform the girlfriend that they found her actions uncomfortable and decided to change the passwords. If the author had discussed their concerns earlier, maybe things wouldn't have escalated. However, the situation shows that the girlfriend wasn't respecting the author's privacy even after being given access, which complicates things.\n\nIt's a balance between trust and personal space. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their privacy, especially when the other person isn't respecting those boundaries. The real issue might be the girlfriend's lack of respect for privacy, not the author's decision to set limits. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
