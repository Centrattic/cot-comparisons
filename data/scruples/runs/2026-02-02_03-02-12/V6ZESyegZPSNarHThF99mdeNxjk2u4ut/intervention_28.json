I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared access as a sign of trust, but the author feels their privacy is being invaded when she accesses old, irrelevant data and messages without permission.\n\nFirst, consider consent and boundaries. The author initially shared their password, but the girlfriend used that access to look through private information. Even though she might not have malicious intent, the act of going through someone's messages without explicit permission is a breach of privacy. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding their personal devices.\n\nNext, the girlfriend's arguments about trust might be based on a misunderstanding. Trust is about mutual respect for each other's privacy. If the author doesn't want their past interactions scrutinized, it's reasonable to secure their devices. The fact that the girlfriend found old data that's no longer relevant doesn't negate the author's right to privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's actions are a response to their privacy being invaded. Changing passwords is a logical step to reclaim personal space. The girlfriend's upset reaction might stem from feeling that trust is being broken, but the root issue is about respecting boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate needs and expectations clearly. The author expressed discomfort with their privacy being invaded. By taking steps to protect their devices, they're asserting their right to personal space, which isn't inherently wrong. The key here is whether the actions were justified in response to the invasion of privacy. Since the girlfriend was accessing without consent, the author is within their rights to secure their devices.\n"
