It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are affecting her chances of finding a partner. The friend had been making insinuating comments about the author's appearance and dating life for two years. The author finally called out the friend's situation honestly, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was repeatedly making comments that were not just personal but also hurtful and untrue. The author was brushing them off for two years, trying to be understanding. Then, when the friend asked directly why she can't find someone, the author gave an honest answer about her situation with the kids and child support. The friend reacted negatively, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author.\n\nThe key points are: Was the author justified in responding as they did? Did they cross a line? The author's response was factual\u2014pointing out that having five kids with different dads without child support could be a barrier. The friend's comments were also hurtful and personal, so the author was defending themselves after being attacked for a long time.\n\nFrom a friend dynamics perspective, honesty is important, but the way it's delivered matters. The author might have been within their right to be honest, especially after enduring two years of insults. However, the method of delivery and the potential for triggering the friend could be a factor. The mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and entitled, which might be a projection of their own biases.\n\nBut the author's response was a direct answer to a direct question. The friend's behavior was problematic, with constant insults. The author's response was a factual explanation, not a personal attack. The friends' reactions might be influenced by their own opinions and not the actual situation. The author's background (working hard, having an MBA, etc.) suggests they aren't entitled. \n\nIn terms of conflict resolution, sometimes honesty can hurt, but if the friend was being asked for advice and the author gave the best answer based on their knowledge, that's fair. The author was defending their own position while pointing out the friend's issues, which might be necessary if the friendship is one-sided. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They addressed a long-standing issue after enduring insults, and their response was a truthful answer to a question posed. The friends' criticisms might stem from misunderstanding the context or not seeing the two-year history of the friend's behavior. The author's response was a necessary correction after being mistreated, so the answer is B.\n"
