It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single with five kids by different fathers is the reason she can't find a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The friend has a history of getting divorced five times, and she's been making the author feel judged for two years with comments about her weight, job, and dating life. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in finding someone. The friend then reacts angrily and ends the conversation.\n\nThe key points here are the ongoing insults the author faced. The friend's comments were both personal and untrue, like suggesting the author's thinness was the reason she has a partner. The author tried to brush them off but eventually snapped, giving a truthful but honest opinion. \n\nNow, I need to consider if this response was appropriate. The author's point was that the friend's situation\u2014multiple kids with different fathers and no child support\u2014might make it hard for someone to commit. Is that a valid point? Well, some people might find that challenging, but it's also possible that the friend has other issues. However, the author was responding to years of insults, which could justify their frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and shouldn't have made that comment. They think the author is being unkind. But the author is defending their own situation, pointing out that they work hard and have their own struggles. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? It's tricky. The author had been the target of insults for a long time, and their response was a direct but truthful statement. While it's possible that the author could have handled it differently, like setting a boundary without pointing out the friend's flaws, the situation was a culmination of two years of being belittled. \n\nIn such cases, people often feel they have to defend themselves after repeated offenses. The author's response was honest, even if it came off as harsh. It's important to note that the friend's behavior was problematic too, making the author's reaction somewhat understandable. \n\nBut maybe there was a better way to handle it. Instead of directly calling out the friend's situation, the author could have said they couldn't relate or that they didn't want to comment further. However, the author's intention was to give an honest answer to a question they were tired of fielding. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's response might have been blunt and could hurt the friend's feelings, it was a reaction to ongoing insults. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were defending themselves after repeated provocation. The friend's behavior was also a significant factor here. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
