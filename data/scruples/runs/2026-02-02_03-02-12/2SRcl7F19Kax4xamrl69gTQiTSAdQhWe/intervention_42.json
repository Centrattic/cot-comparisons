It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who spoke up to their friend was in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has been making repeated, insulting comments about the author's dating life and work, despite the author trying to brush them off. The author finally responds by pointing out their friend's situation, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of making hurtful remarks that are both untrue and demeaning. The author has been patient, responding with advice like \"focus on yourself,\" but the friend continues the insults. The author's response was to address the root issue they believed was causing the problem\u2014the friend's multiple children with different fathers and lack of child support. \n\nNow, evaluating whether the author was in the wrong. The key points are the nature of the friend's behavior prior to the author's response. The friend's comments were not just occasional but a two-year pattern of insults. The author's response was direct, pointing out what they saw as the core issue. However, the friend took offense and ended the conversation. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author, suggesting they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being unkind.\n\nThe question is whether the author crossed a line. While the friend's behavior was clearly problematic, the author's response might have been seen as harsh or judgmental, even if they meant it as a truth. The friend's situation is complex, and the author's comment could be perceived as blaming the victim, especially if the friend's inability to find a partner is due to factors beyond her control. However, the author had been trying to be kind and only spoke up after repeated insults. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual friends' reactions. They might be defending the friend more, perhaps because the author's work in the adult industry is stigmatized, making the author's comments seem more judgmental. The author mentions they work there but have an MBA and a stable income, which adds layers to the situation.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, maybe the author could have framed the comment in a more supportive way, focusing on the friend's challenges rather than making a direct accusation. However, after two years of constant insults, the author had valid reasons for being defensive and finally speaking their mind. \n\nSo, balancing the friend's prior behavior against the author's response, I think the author is not in the wrong because they were responding to ongoing, hurtful comments. However, the delivery might have been rough, but the intent was to address the root issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
