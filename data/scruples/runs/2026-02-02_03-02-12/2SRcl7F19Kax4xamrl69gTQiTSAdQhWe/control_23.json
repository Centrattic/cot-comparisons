It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because she has five kids by different fathers. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has five kids with different fathers and is currently single. She's been divorced five times and hasn't received child support. She's been asking the author questions that come off as insulting. The author has tried to brush them off with advice like focusing on oneself and being in a small town. But when the friend asks again, the author responds bluntly by pointing out her situation with the kids and how it might affect her dating prospects. This causes the friend to get angry and end the conversation, and mutual friends now side with the friend, saying the author is being privileged.\n\nThe author is defending their actions, saying they were tired of the insults and just told the truth. They mention their own hardships, like working hard for their achievements and having two kids in a 50/50 custody arrangement. They also work in the adult industry, which the friend has criticized even though she tried it too.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the author's response was honest but possibly harsh. The friend's behavior was hurtful and persistent, but the author's reply addressed a sensitive topic\u2014child support and the challenges of having multiple children with different fathers. The mutual friends are criticizing the author for \"privilege,\" which might relate to the author's ability to work part-time in a high-income job, which the friend might not have access to, or maybe because the author's advice wasn't the best approach.\n\nI need to assess if the author overstepped. The friend's comments were indeed mean, but calling someone out for something personal like having multiple children with different fathers is a sensitive issue. The author might have thought they were being truthful, but it's possible that the way they delivered it was hurtful and didn't consider the friend's feelings or the underlying reasons for her situation. The friend might already feel vulnerable or defensive, and the author's blunt approach could have been unkind, even if the truth is accurate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their own work in the adult industry, which the friend also tried, but that doesn't necessarily justify the response. The author's reply might have been more about defending themselves against the friend's insults by turning the focus back on her. However, the way they did it might have been too direct and possibly invalidating of the friend's struggles.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was seen as harsh and lacking empathy. Even if the author believes the truth is valid, how it's communicated matters in maintaining a friendship. The author might have intended to help, but the method was counterproductive. So, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their response was unkind and could have been more empathetic, even if the friend's behavior was irritating.\n"
