It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's still single because she has five kids by different fathers. The friend was making hurtful comments about the author's dating life and work, and the author finally responded with that statement, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has a history of making insults and the author tried to brush them off for two years. The author's response was a direct comment about the friend's situation. The key question is whether that response was justified or if it crossed a line.\n\nThe author's friend had been making personal, sometimes untrue comments. The author's reply points out a potential reason for the friend's dating struggles, which is a factual aspect of her life. However, even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered and the context matters. The friend had been insulting the author, so the author might have felt justified in responding in kind.\n\nBut in terms of social norms, friends aren't supposed to be cruel or make each other feel bad, even if the other person is being unkind. The author's response might be seen as cutting off the conversation or being too harsh, even if it's true. The friend's actions (five kids with different dads) could be a sensitive topic, and bringing it up in the heat of an argument might be unkind.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are taking the side of the original friend, suggesting that the author's comment was hurtful. The author's mention of their own situation (two kids with one dad, working in an industry others might judge, etc.) shows they have their own challenges, but that doesn't necessarily make the response acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had been enduring insults for two years, trying to be supportive, and finally stood up for themselves. The statement was honest and addressed the root issue the friend might have been facing. If the friend's behavior was the main obstacle to her dating, pointing that out could be seen as giving a truthful perspective, albeit harshly.\n\nBut in terms of friendship, honesty doesn't always mean being brutally honest. The author might have needed to address the insults in a different, more constructive way rather than attacking the friend's personal choices. The friend's response (insult fury) suggests that the comment was indeed hurtful, regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, the question is whether the truth of the statement justifies the manner in which it was delivered. Socially, even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered can affect the outcome. The author might not be in the wrong for speaking the truth, but they might have handled the situation poorly. However, since the friend was consistently unkind, the author's response could be seen as a last resort. Alternatively, it might be considered a breach of friendship boundaries.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the truth was the main issue or the delivery. The author's intention was to stop the insults by addressing them, but it might have been more constructive to offer support rather than criticism. The mutual friends' reaction suggests that the social circle found the author's comment too harsh, implying that the author is in the wrong. However, the author's perspective is that they were defending themselves after being insulted for two years.\n\nGiven that, the author's response might be seen as justified in a personal context but socially inappropriate. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the truth of the statement is valid and the author was responding to ongoing insults, it's a tricky call. But in most social circles, even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered matters. The author's comment was direct and might have been the trigger for the friend's anger. The mutual friends' opinion that the author is privileged and being a \"shitty friend\" suggests that the author is in the wrong in their eyes. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in general, not just according to the mutual friends.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's response was honest but perhaps delivered in a way that's seen as unkind. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the statement is true, the manner and timing could have been better. However, some might argue that the author was within their rights to respond after enduring two years of insults. The final decision depends on whether the author's truth was a valid response or if it was an overreach.\n"
