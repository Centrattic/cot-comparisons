It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author for two years, including remarks about her weight, job, and dating life. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the kids and lack of child support, which leads to a fallout. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is wrong and that they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being judgmental.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend was clearly being insulting, but the author's response might be seen as harsh or judgmental. Even if the author felt wronged, pointing out the friend's situation could come off as attacking her personal issues, which might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic. Even though the friend tried it too, bringing up the author's work might not help. The mutual friends' reactions suggest they think the author overstepped, even if the friend was rude. So, while the friend was being a jerk, the author's response might have been too direct and could be seen as adding insult to injury. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, sometimes it's better to address the behavior rather than the person. The author might have felt justified, but the way they responded could have been more constructive. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they crossed a line, even if the friend was being mean. \n\nBut I should consider if the author had a right to defend themselves. The friend's comments were personal and hurtful, so the author might have felt they had to respond. However, the response focused on the friend's personal issues, which could be seen as attacking instead of setting a boundary. Maybe a different approach, like not engaging or addressing the insults without blaming the friend's situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because even though the friend was being rude, the response could have been more tactful. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
