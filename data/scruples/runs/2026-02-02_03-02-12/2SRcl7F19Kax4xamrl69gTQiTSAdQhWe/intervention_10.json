It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's still single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the author finally snapped with a truthful response. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend repeatedly made hurtful and possibly untrue comments directed at the author. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses, but eventually, the insults became too much. The final comment about the five kids was the author's attempt to point out a realistic barrier to finding a partner. \n\nThe friend's behavior seems to be more problematic here. She's making personal attacks, possibly out of jealousy or her own insecurities. The author's response, while direct, was based on a factual observation that having multiple children from different fathers could deter potential partners. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, but given the history of insults, the author was defending themselves.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions are also interesting. They're side-eyeing the author, suggesting they don't understand the friend's struggles, but the author has their own valid points about working hard and managing two kids with a single dad. The friend's situation is complicated, but she might not be in a position to critique the author's life choices.\n\nThe key question is whether the author overstepped. The author's response was a truthful statement pointing out a realistic issue. However, in a sensitive situation like this, even if the statement is true, the delivery could have been more compassionate. But considering the friend's history of insults, the author was protecting their self-esteem. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently, like focusing on their own life without bringing up the friend's choices. But the friend's comments were personal and insinuated that the author's success (dates, job) was due to superficial reasons. The author's response was a counter to that, pointing out a significant factor affecting the friend's dating life. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the friend was more in the wrong for the two years of insults. The author's response, while direct, was a reaction to being attacked. The author isn't in the wrong for calling out the reality that the friend's situation might be a barrier. But maybe the approach could have been softer. However, given the context, the author's truthfulness and attempt to set a boundary is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The friend's behavior was the main issue, and the author was defending themselves against persistent insults.\n"
