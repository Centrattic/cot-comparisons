It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for telling her friend that her multiple kids with different fathers are why she's single. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has 5 kids by different fathers, all divorced. She's been making insulting comments to the author for two years, about her weight, her job, and why she's successful in dating. The author has been brushing off the insults but finally responds by pointing out her friend's situation as the reason she's struggling to find a partner. The friend reacts angrily, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying she's being entitled and using \"skinny privilege.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend made ongoing, hurtful comments over two years. The author finally responded by addressing the friend's actions (5 kids with different dads) as the reason for her lack of success. The friends are now siding with the friend, accusing the author of being privileged.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether her response was appropriate. The friend's behavior was clearly toxic and insulting, but the author's response was a personal truth about her friend's situation. However, even if the statement is factually true, the way it's delivered might be hurtful. Friends are supposed to support each other, even when there are disagreements. However, the friend was already being insulting, so the author might have felt justified in calling out the behavior. \n\nBut, in social interactions, even if someone is being mean, retaliating with a personal truth can be seen as crossing a line. The author's statement might be true, but it's a sensitive topic, and bringing up the friend's personal failings in a direct way could be hurtful. Also, the friend's other comments (about the author's job, weight) were untrue or negative, so the author might have felt attacked and finally decided to defend herself. \n\nHowever, the friends are now criticizing the author for being entitled. The author's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, and the friend's insults about that could have been a trigger. The author's response was direct and pointed, which could be seen as harsh, even if the friend was being a jerk first. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while the friend was in the wrong for the constant insults, the author's response might be seen as too direct. There might have been a better way to address the friend's behavior without making a personal attack, even if it's a true statement. \n\nSo, the author's intentions were to call out the friend's actions, but the method could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because even if the friend was being mean, the response was a personal attack that could be hurtful. However, it's also possible that the author was defending herself after a lot of insults, which complicates it. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's statement was a justified response to the friend's behavior. If the friend's actions led to a situation where the author felt compelled to respond, but the response was a direct personal critique, then it's a gray area. However, in social situations, even when someone is being mean, the appropriate response might be to distance oneself or address the behavior without reciprocating with personal attacks. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because she responded with a personal truth that could be seen as attacking her friend's character, even if the friend was being toxic. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
