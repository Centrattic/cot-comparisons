It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has a history of having five kids with different fathers and is currently single. The friend has been making comments that the author perceives as insults about her dating life and job. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her difficulty in finding a partner. The friend got upset, hung up, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend has made several comments that the author finds insulting. Examples include comments about her weight, implying that she only dates \"basic blondes\" and questioning her dating life. The author tried to brush these off for two years, giving advice like focusing on oneself. Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer about the five kids and the lack of child support.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The key factors here are the nature of the comments, the friend's prior behavior, and the appropriateness of the author's response.\n\nThe author's friend has a history of making personal and seemingly derogatory remarks. The author felt targeted and decided to respond honestly. The response was about the friend's specific situation, which the author believes is a barrier to her finding a partner. The author's friends are calling her out for being privileged and not understanding her friend's struggles, but the author feels she's not entitled and that her friend's issues are not as major as she claims.\n\nFrom a social dynamics perspective, even if the friend's comments were hurtful, the author's response might have been a direct confrontation. The author's answer could be seen as pointing out a truth the friend might not want to hear. However, bringing up the friend's personal situation in such a blunt manner could come off as harsh, even if it's the truth. The author's friends might feel it's judgmental or invalidates the friend's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending herself after repeated insults. The friend's behavior was persistent and personal, so the author might feel justified in addressing it. The author's response was a direct answer to a direct question, but it's possible that a different approach could have been more effective, like addressing the friend's behavior first before giving advice.\n\nThe mutual friends' reaction suggests that they feel the author overstepped, possibly because they see the friend's situation as more complex or sensitive. The author's mention of the friend's child support issue might touch on a sensitive topic that the friend isn't ready to hear, especially coming from someone who is in a different situation (the author has two kids with one dad, works in an industry the friend also tried, and has an MBA).\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the author's statement is factually accurate, the way it was delivered might be seen as unkind. The author was tired of the insults and finally responded, but the timing and method of that response could be questioned. Maybe there's a better way to approach the friend without making a direct judgment about her past, especially in a situation where the friend is already vulnerable and seeking support.\n\nThe author might have a valid point about the friend's situation affecting her dating life, but the way it was communicated might have caused more harm. The friend's reaction (insult fury and hanging up) suggests that the comment was perceived as an attack, even if it was meant as honest advice. The mutual friends' criticism of the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled indicates that the author's response didn't consider the friend's perspective adequately.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had reasons to be upset and the friend's behavior was problematic, the author's response may have been too blunt and not the most supportive approach. It's possible that the author was acting in self-defense but crossed a line in how they addressed the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their response could be seen as judgmental and hurtful, even if their intention was to be honest.\n"
