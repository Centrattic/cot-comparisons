It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are affecting her dating life. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author, and the author finally snapped back with their honest opinion. Now the author is getting backlash from mutual friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of making personal, sometimes insulting remarks, and the author tried to brush them off for two years. The final response was pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her difficulties. The author's intention was to be truthful, not malicious, but the delivery might have been harsh.\n\nThe friend's behavior was hurtful and repetitive, which could justify the author's frustration. However, the author's response, while honest, might have been seen as judgmental. The friend's insecurities and possible mental health issues could factor in here. Even if the comment was true, the way it's delivered matters in a friendship. Calling out someone's personal issues in the middle of an argument, especially after they've been making insults, can come off as cruel, regardless of the truth.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the comment crossed a line. The author might have overstepped by bringing up the friend's past in such a direct manner. Even if the author's intentions were to help, the comment was likely hurtful and could be perceived as attacking the friend's character. The author might have a valid point about their own hard work and not being privileged, but friendships require tact, and the approach here was probably too blunt and unkind.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a reason to be upset, the way they addressed the issue might have been inappropriate. Friendships require empathy and understanding, and even if the friend was being difficult, responding with a direct accusation might not have been the best approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
