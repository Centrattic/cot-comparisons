It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong when they told their friend that she's single because of having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments for two years. She's insulting the author about their weight, their job, and their dating life. The author has been brushing these off with advice like \"focus on yourself.\" Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds honestly by pointing out the friend's multiple children with different fathers as a reason for her difficulties. The friend gets angry and cuts off the conversation. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel they were defending themselves after years of insults. They believe they're not privileged and have worked hard. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and possibly crossing into bullying. The author might have felt cornered and finally snapped. But when the author responded by pointing out the friend's situation, was that a valid response or an attack?\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves after ongoing insults. They might have felt justified in pointing out what they see as a root issue. But on the other hand, bringing up someone's personal life, especially sensitive topics like having multiple children with different fathers, can be very hurtful and judgmental. Even if the author believes it's the truth, the way it was delivered might have been harsh without any kindness or support.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are reacting by saying the author is privileged. The author works in the adult industry, which might be stigmatized, so they might feel they don't have privilege. But maybe the friends see the author's situation as more stable (two kids with one dad, 50/50 custody) compared to the friend with five kids and multiple fathers. The author's truth might be valid, but the delivery and context matter.\n\nAnother point: the friend tried to get the author to talk about their dating life, leading to the author's response. The author might have been honest but without empathy. Even if the friend's situation is a factor, pointing it out bluntly could be seen as attacking instead of offering support. The author could have expressed concern without being judgmental.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author was responding to years of insults, their response might have been too harsh and not supportive. They might not have been in the wrong entirely, but perhaps they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the friend was being abusive and the author was defending themselves, maybe not. But the response was personal and potentially hurtful. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they attacked the friend's personal situation without a kind approach. Or B (not in the wrong) because they were defending themselves from ongoing insults. It's a tough call, but maybe A because the response was a personal attack, even if in response to insults.\n"
