It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. The situation involves a lot of back-and-forth insults and hurt feelings. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting, like implying that the author's success in relationships is due to being skinny or being a \"basic blonde.\" The author has tried to brush these off but finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the five kids and lack of child support. This leads to the friend being upset and mutual friends criticizing the author.\n\nNow, the core question is whether the author was wrong. The key points to consider are: 1) The friend's behavior was already toxic, with persistent insults. 2) The author's response was a factual statement about the friend's circumstances. 3) The mutual friends are now side-eyeing the author, accusing them of privilege, but the author feels defensive about that.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the friend's comments were hurtful, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the statement is true, bringing up someone's personal and sensitive issues in a conflict can be hurtful. The author's intention was to set boundaries after enduring insults, but maybe the approach was too direct and public, leading to further conflict. \n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, and the friend had tried that too. The author might have felt their work was being judged, but bringing up the friend's child support issues might not be the best way to address that. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's statement was perceived as a judgment that's hard to retract, even if it's the truth. The question is whether truth justifies the manner of delivery. In friendships, honesty is important, but timing and sensitivity matter. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for defending themselves, but the way they delivered the message might have been unkind, even if it was a truthful point. \n\nSo, considering all that, while the author had valid reasons to be tired of the insults, the response might have been too harsh, especially since it's a personal and sensitive topic. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the fallout. The answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a better perspective. Alternatively, if the author was finally standing up for themselves after being insulted, maybe they're not wrong. However, the standard here is whether the action was the right move. Since the response escalated the situation and caused significant hurt, even if it's a truth, it's possible the author is in the wrong for the way they handled it. So, the answer is A.\n"
