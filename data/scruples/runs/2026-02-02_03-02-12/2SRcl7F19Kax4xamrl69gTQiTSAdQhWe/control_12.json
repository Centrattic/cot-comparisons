It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, the friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments about the author over two years. Things like implying the author's success in dating is due to being skinny, which isn't true, and other insults. The author has been brushing these off, but finally snaps and tells the truth about the friend's situation. \n\nThe friend then reacts negatively, hanging up, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being privileged and uncaring. The author feels they were justified because they've worked hard and aren't entitled. The question is whether the author was wrong to say that.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has been consistently making hurtful remarks, possibly with elements of jealousy or insecurity. The author, in response, points out the friend's own issues as the root of the problem. \n\nBut is it appropriate to respond with such a direct and personal truth? Even if the friend was being insulting, does the author have the right to call out their behavior in that way? The line between honesty and being mean is thin. Also, mutual friends are taking the friend's side, suggesting that the author's comment might have crossed a line, even if the friend was wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the author's job in the adult industry is being criticized by the friend, which adds to the tension. The friend's comments might be rooted in her own insecurities or jealousy. However, the author's response, while perhaps honest, could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nThe key factors are: 1) ongoing insults from the friend, 2) the author's response being a truthful but personal critique, and 3) the aftermath where mutual friends side with the friend. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is sensitivity. The author might have felt justified in stopping the insults, but the method could be seen as harsh. There might have been a better way to address the issue without attacking the friend's personal choices. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the author's response was a direct but truthful counter to years of insults, maybe not. However, the way it was delivered and the content (pointing out the friend's personal situation) might have been too much, even if the friend was being hurtful. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment wasn't well-received and may have been perceived as unkind despite the context.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because even if the friend was being insulting, the response was a personal attack that could have been handled more tactfully.\n"
