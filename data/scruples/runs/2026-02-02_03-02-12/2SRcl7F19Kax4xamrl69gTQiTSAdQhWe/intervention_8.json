It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. The friend was making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and finally the author snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and hurtful, even if they were jokes. The author was tired of defending against these insults. The response the author gave was pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in finding a partner. The friend got upset and hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nThe author argues that they were just being honest and that the mutual friends are wrong to judge them. They also mention their own work ethic and responsibilities, suggesting they're not entitled. The question is whether the author's response was the wrong thing to say.\n\nI should consider if the author's response was a valid and honest answer to the friend's question, which asked for the truth. The friend had been asking for advice for two years, and the author finally gave their opinion. However, the way it was said might have been harsh, but the content was the truth. The friend's situation with five kids and no child support could indeed be a barrier, as potential partners might be deterred by the complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's comment could be seen as insensitive or judgmental. Even if it's true, pointing out someone's personal struggles in that way can be hurtful. The mutual friends' reactions might stem from the perception that the author was making a judgment about the friend's personal choices, which could come off as condescending.\n\nHowever, the author was responding to years of insults and was finally fed up. They might feel justified in being honest, especially since the friend asked for the truth. The key points are the context of ongoing insults and the friend's own history contributing to her situation.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author was honest but perhaps could have handled it differently. However, given the friend's repeated provocation, the author's response was a direct answer to a direct question. The mutual friends' criticisms might be missing the context of the two-year buildup. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
