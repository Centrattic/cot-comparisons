It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author over two years. The friend's comments are about the author's ability to have a successful dating life, implying that it's because of her being skinny or other superficial reasons. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with multiple children and no child support, which the friend then reacts negatively to. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they were out of line and have privilege.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right to say that. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nPossible angles: \n1. The friend was being insulting and the author was defending themselves. In that case, the author might be justified in pointing out the friend's own issues. But is it appropriate to call someone out like that, especially if it's a sensitive topic like having multiple children? \n2. The author's comment might be seen as hurtful and not the friend's fault. Maybe the friend has other issues beyond her kids that contribute to her relationship struggles. \n3. The mutual friends are reacting by saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. So the friends feel the author is not understanding the friend's situation. \n4. The author's own situation includes working in the adult industry, which might be a sensitive topic. But the author mentions they have an MBA and another job, which they might be proud of. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the friend was being insulting for two years, the author might feel justified in pushing back. However, addressing the issue by pointing out the friend's children might be crossing a line. It's possible that the author's response was honest but not kind, even if the underlying message was valid. Sometimes, even if something is true, the way it's delivered matters. The friend might take it as an attack, especially if child support issues are sensitive or if the friend is already struggling. \n\nAlso, mutual friends might feel that the author is taking sides unfairly, or that the comment was too personal. The friends might not agree with the friend's behavior but still think the author's response was too harsh. \n\nAnother angle: The author's response might be accurate in that having multiple children with different fathers could make it harder to find a partner, but it's not the only factor. The author's comment might be oversimplifying the friend's relationship issues. Maybe the friend has other personal challenges or makes poor choices in partners. \n\nAdditionally, the author's own job in the adult industry might make some people uncomfortable, and the friend's insults about it could be a trigger point. The author might be feeling defensive and responding in kind.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's truth was necessary in that moment. If the friend was asking for advice and the author gave their honest opinion, maybe it's reasonable. But if the comment was meant to hurt or was said in the heat of the moment, it could be seen as wrong. The fact that the friend hung up and got angry suggests that the comment was hurtful, regardless of intent.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response was potentially hurtful and addressed a sensitive topic. However, if the author had a right to defend themselves after being mocked for two years, maybe B (not in the wrong). But since the mutual friends are reacting negatively, it's possible that the community perceives the author's response as crossing a line. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, so the answer might be B. However, I need to decide based on the analysis. The core issue is whether calling out someone's personal situation is acceptable in response to their insults. Some might say yes, others no. In friendships, direct honesty can be appreciated, but it's also possible that the author's response was too blunt and unkind for the situation. So, leaning towards A because even if the friend was being rude, the author's reply was likely not the best approach.\n"
