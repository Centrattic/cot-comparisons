It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has been divorced five times, each time with a different father for her kids, and she's been making a bunch of insults towards the author. The author finally snaps and tells her that the reason she's having trouble finding someone is because of having five kids with different dads and no child support. The friend gets angry, and now the mutual friends are side-eyeing the author, saying things like they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend's behavior: she's been making repeated, personal insults over two years. The author tried to brush them off, giving advice like \"focus on yourself.\" Then, when the friend keeps asking why the author has dates and kids, the author responds by pointing out the friend's situation. The author's response is factual but perhaps harsh. The friend reacts negatively, and now the author is being criticized by mutual friends for being privileged.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. On one hand, the friend was being insulting and maybe the author felt it was time to call out the real issue. But on the other hand, even if the friend was being rude, does the author have the right to respond with something that points out the friend's personal flaws? Also, the author mentions working in the adult industry and having an MBA, which might add to the complexity of how others perceive their situation.\n\nThe friends are saying the author is privileged and doesn't understand the friend's struggles. The author argues they've worked hard and aren't privileged. But the friend's issues might not be about privilege in terms of societal advantages but more about her own choices or circumstances. The author's response was direct but might have been hurtful, even if true.\n\nIs it ever okay to respond to insults with a counter-insult based on someone's personal situation? Even if the friend was being rude, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe addressing the behavior instead of the person's history. Also, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment might have been seen as attacking the friend's personal life rather than defending themselves.\n\nSo, while the friend's behavior was definitely inconsiderate and insulting, the author's response might have crossed a line. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal history, would have been better. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not handling it more gracefully, even if the friend was the one starting the conflict.\n"
