It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has five kids from different fathers and has been divorced five times. The friend keeps making comments to the author that are insulting, like questioning how the author managed to have a partner despite having kids and not being as conventionally attractive. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with multiple kids and no child support might make it hard for someone to commit, and the friend gets upset and hangs up.\n\nNow, the author is being criticized by mutual friends for being entitled and having \"skinny privilege,\" even though the author mentions they're not actually skinny but work out and are healthy. The author feels they were just being honest and that the friend was the one being insulting all along.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the friend's behavior versus the author's response. The friend has been repeatedly making personal and insulting comments, which the author tried to brush off but eventually snapped back. The author's response was based on the friend's situation being a barrier to finding a partner. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comments were clearly hurtful and judgmental, and the author was the one defending. However, the author's response was also a personal critique of the friend's life choices. Even if it's true, calling out someone's situation in a direct, blunt way can come off as hurtful, especially if it's done in the heat of the moment. The mutual friends are probably taking the friend's side because the author's response was a direct jab, even if it was honest. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend was starting the insults, and the author was just pointing out the obvious. The author might feel they were justified. However, in terms of social dynamics, responding with your own critique, even if true, might not be the best approach. Maybe the author could have addressed the friend's issues without pointing out her situation so directly. \n\nBut considering that the friend was the one initiating the insults and the author was the one defending, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the way they delivered the response could have been more tactful. The answer might be a mix of both, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the friend was the aggressor, but the author's response was a direct and personal criticism, there's a case for the author being in the wrong in terms of how they handled it, even if their intention was to be honest. So maybe answer A (Yes) because the author's response might have been unkind, even if the friend was being mean. Alternatively, answer B (No) because the friend was the one starting the conflict. \n\nI think the right call here is that the author is not entirely in the wrong because they were responding to sustained insults, but they could have handled it better. However, since the question is a yes/no, the answer might be B (No) because the author was defending themselves against a hostile friend.\n"
