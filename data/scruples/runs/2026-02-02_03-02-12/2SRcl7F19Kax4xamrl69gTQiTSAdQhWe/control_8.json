It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and has been divorced five times. The friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting, like implying that her weight or job status is the reason she has a partner and kids. The author tried to brush off these comments for two years, giving polite responses. Then, when the friend asked a question that made the author feel attacked, the author finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in finding a partner. The friend took offense and hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was right to make that comment. Let's think about the elements here: What was the friend's intent with her questions? Were the author's comments a valid response? And is it fair to say the author is in the wrong?\n\nThe friend's comments seem to be a form of passive-aggressive teasing, possibly out of jealousy or insecurity. She's asking the author questions that are backhanded, which the author found hurtful. The author's response was to point out a potential reason for the friend's situation, which is that having multiple children with different fathers might make it harder to find someone who is a \"father figure.\" The author is not making up a reason but citing a fact about the friend's life that others might find off-putting.\n\nHowever, even if the author is stating a truth, the way it's delivered could be problematic. The friend is already in a vulnerable situation, and the author's comment, while honest, might have been harsh or lacking in empathy. Maybe the author could have addressed the issue more sensitively. The key here is whether the comment was a direct attack or a truthful observation that the friend already knows but the author is willing to say out loud.\n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the author for \"privilege\" and \"entitlement,\" suggesting that the author's response was insensitive. The author argues that they have worked hard and are not privileged. But the friend's perspective is that the author is not understanding her struggles. The author's line of work in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, but the friend's comments were also about the author's job.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were pointing out a factual reason that others might consider a barrier. However, the approach could have been more compassionate. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful, and the author had a right to respond when they were tired of the insults. But the comment might have come off as judgmental or dismissive, which is why the friend reacted so strongly and the mutual friends are siding with her. The author's response was honest but perhaps lacked the tact needed in a friendship where the friend is struggling. So maybe the answer is A, but with the reasoning that the truth was a factor, and the author could have handled it better without necessarily being in the wrong.\n"
