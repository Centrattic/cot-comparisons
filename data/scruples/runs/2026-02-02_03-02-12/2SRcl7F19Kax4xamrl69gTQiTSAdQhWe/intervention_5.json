It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers make it hard to find a partner. The friend had been giving them insults for two years about their weight, job, dating life, etc., and the author finally snapped with a truthful response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and ongoing. She was making personal attacks, which the author tried to ignore or deflect. The author's response was specific to the friend's situation, pointing out the challenge of having five kids with different fathers without child support. That's a factual statement about a real-life obstacle, not just an insult. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's response crossed a line. The author's reply was honest and addressed the root issue the friend might be facing, rather than the personal attacks. The friend's reaction was to become angry and hang up, which suggests she didn't want to confront the truth. \n\nNow, the author's motivations: they were tired of being insulted and felt compelled to respond with a truthful but direct statement. The friends and mutual acquaintances are siding with the friend, accusing the author of having privilege and being entitled. But the author points out their own challenges, like working in a stigmatized job and having their own relationship issues. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the response was truthful and addressed the actual reason for the friend's dating struggles, then it's a valid point. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. But given the context of two years of insults, the author's response was a factual statement rather than an attack. The friend's actions were the initial problem, and the author's reply was a matter of standing up for themselves. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
