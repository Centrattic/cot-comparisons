It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been going through a lot of divorces and having kids with different fathers. The friend has been making comments that hurt the author, like implying her success in dating is because she's skinny or that guys only want basic blondes. The author kept brushing off these comments, giving her friend advice like focusing on oneself and someone special coming around. Finally, the author tells her friend that having five kids with different dads makes it hard to find someone because of the child support issue. The friend gets angry and hangs up, and now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong and that she has privilege and is a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was justified. The friend was making personal and hurtful comments, which the author was trying to ignore. But when the friend keeps pushing and asking the same questions, the author finally responds with a truthful but blunt answer. The key here is whether the author's response was crossing a line or if it was a reasonable reaction to ongoing provocation.\n\nThe author's statement about the friend's situation being a barrier to finding someone might be a valid point, but the way it's delivered could be seen as judgmental. The friend was already in a sensitive position, having gone through multiple divorces and with children from different fathers. The author's comment might have stung because it was a direct critique of the friend's choices or circumstances. However, the friend was also making personal jabs at the author, so there's a back-and-forth of negativity here.\n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. But the author argues that they've worked hard for their success and that their job in the adult industry is not something to be ashamed of. The author's response might have been honest but perhaps not the most tactful. The question is whether the author overstepped or if they were just defending themselves after being insulted.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's job in the adult industry makes their situation different. The friend tried the job but the author's current job gives them more stability. The author might feel that the friend's criticism is unfair given their own challenges. However, the friend's comments were personal and possibly meant to undermine the author's success.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when a friend repeatedly makes hurtful comments, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author might have felt that their friend was being intentionally mean, so responding with a truth that the author believed was the reason for the friend's situation could be seen as a defense mechanism. However, in social situations, even if the truth is accurate, how it's delivered matters. The author's comment might have been more of a direct attack rather than a constructive or empathetic response.\n\nThe author's friends are now taking the friend's side, suggesting that the author was wrong. This could be due to the author's choice of words and the context of their own job, which some might view as not as traditional or serious. The author's frustration at being labeled privileged and entitled might be valid if they haven't had it easy, but the friends' reactions indicate that the author's response was perceived as hurtful.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author might be in the wrong not because the statement was false, but because the way it was delivered was harsh and possibly judgmental. The friend was already vulnerable, and the author's response might have been the last straw in a series of negative interactions. Even if the friend was being insincere, the author could have found a better way to address the situation without making a personal attack. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their response, while honest, was delivered in a way that exacerbated the conflict rather than resolving it.\n"
