It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been through five marriages, each with different fathers for her kids, and none of them pay child support. The friend keeps asking the author questions that are pretty much insults, comparing the author's dating life and work. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with the five kids and no support is a reason why she's having trouble dating. The friend got angry and hung up, and now mutual friends are taking the friend's side, saying the author is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend has been making personal and insulting remarks for two years. The author tried to brush them off politely, but eventually, when the friend asked again, the author gave a blunt answer. The key here is whether the truth was a valid response given the prior behavior.\n\nThe author's response was honest, pointing out a real issue that could affect dating. However, it's a sensitive topic. The friend's situation is her own life, and while the author's statement might be factually true, delivering it in that manner might have come off as harsh or judgmental, especially considering the history of insults. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line by addressing personal matters. The friends' reactions suggest that they perceive the author's statement as hurtful and privileged, which might indicate that the author overstepped. The author's intention was to be truthful and stop the insults, but the method might not have been the best approach. A better approach might have been to address the friend's behavior without being critical of her personal life. So, while the friend's behavior was bad, the author's response might still be considered wrong because it was direct and possibly unkind, even if truthful.\n"
