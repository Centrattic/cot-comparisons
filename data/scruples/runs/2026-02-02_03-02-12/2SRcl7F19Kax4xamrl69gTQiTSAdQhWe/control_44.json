It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. The friend had been making insulting remarks about the author for two years, and finally, the author responded with the honest but blunt truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's behavior included personal, insinuating comments that were not only insulting but also targeted the author's personal life and choices. The author had been trying to brush these off with polite responses, but after repeated provocation, they decided to confront the issue directly. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's comment about not having a real job might have been a trigger. However, the author's response about the five different fathers could be seen as a direct hit, even if it's the truth. The friend might feel that the author is blaming her situation on her past, which she might not agree with. \n\nAlso, mutual friends are now siding with the friend, suggesting that the author has \"privilege\" and is being shaming. The author feels defensive, emphasizing their own hard work and the fact that they're not as privileged as people think. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while honesty is valued, the manner in which it's delivered matters. The author might not be in the wrong because they were defending themselves after being insulted multiple times. However, the approach could have been more compassionate. Maybe pointing out the correlation between having multiple children from different fathers and difficulty finding a partner without being judgmental would have been better. \n\nBut since the author was responding to insults and had tried to ignore them, their reaction, though blunt, was a direct response to the friend's provocations. However, the way it was delivered might have been too harsh, leading to the friend's outburst. The mutual friends seeing the author as \"entitled\" might be projecting their own biases. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent was to stop the insults and explain their own situation, which is understandable. However, the delivery might have been lacking in empathy. But considering the context of ongoing insults, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in how they addressed the issue.\n"
