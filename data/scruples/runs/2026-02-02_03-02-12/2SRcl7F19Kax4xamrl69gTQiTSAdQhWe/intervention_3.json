It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status might be due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been insulting the author for two years, and the author finally responded honestly. The mutual friends are now siding with the friend, claiming the author is privileged and had no right to say that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend has been making hurtful and untrue comments over two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses but eventually snapped. The key point is that the author's statement was a direct response to the friend's insults and was based on an honest observation about the friend's situation. The author's own circumstances (two kids from the same dad, split custody, working in the adult industry but also having an MBA) contrast with the friend's situation, which might be complicating her dating life.\n\nNow, the argument here is whether the author overstepped by pointing out the friend's past. The friend's actions (five divorces, no child support, possibly affecting her ability to find partners) are factual, so the author's comment isn't a personal attack but a realistic assessment. The author was defending themselves against insults and addressing the root issue the friend was facing. However, friends often have boundaries about discussing such personal matters, even if they're factual. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author might have breached those boundaries, even if the intent was to help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was tired of being insulted and responded with a truthful statement. The friend's behavior was also problematic, making the author's response somewhat a self-defense move. The question is whether the truth was an appropriate way to address it. In friendships, being honest is important, but timing and sensitivity matter. The author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to years of insults and giving a factual answer to a question the friend had asked repeatedly.\n\nBut I should also consider if the author's tone or delivery was harsh. The friend's reaction was an \"insult fury,\" which might indicate the author was too direct. However, since the comment was based on reality and the friend was the one pushing for answers, the author's response could be justified as honest feedback. The mutual friends might be projecting their own biases, especially the \"skinny privilege\" claim, given the author's healthy weight and the friend's eating habits being mocked.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's response was honest and addressed the friend's underlying issue, even if it was delivered at a tense moment. The friend's prior behavior and the context of the conversation support the author's stance. So, the answer is B.\n"
