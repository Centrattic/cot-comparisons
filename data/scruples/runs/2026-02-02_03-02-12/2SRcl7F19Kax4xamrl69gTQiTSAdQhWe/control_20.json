It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is still single. The friend has been making some pretty hurtful comments to the author over the past two years, asking questions that come off as insults. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with five kids and no child support might be why she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend gets angry and hangs up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were clearly targeting the author's appearance, work, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses like telling her to focus on herself. But after repeated insults, the author finally snapped and gave a direct answer about the friend's situation. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author was justified in responding that way. The friend had been making personal attacks for two years, so it's understandable that the author felt defensive. However, bringing up the five kids and child support could be seen as a sensitive topic. Even though it's the truth, it might be considered a low blow because it's personal and could be hurtful. \n\nBut also, the friend was the one consistently attacking the author, so maybe the author was just pushing back. However, the author's response might have been too harsh, even if the friend started it. Friends are supposed to be supportive, so retaliating with a personal truth could damage the friendship. Additionally, mutual friends are now siding with the friend, which complicates things. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's job in the adult industry is a sensitive topic, and the friend had already tried that job, so maybe the friend felt jealous or insecure. The author's response might have been a way to highlight the friend's own issues, but perhaps it was not the best approach. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong if the response was too harsh and crossed a line, even if they were provoked. Alternatively, if the author was just stating the truth as they see it and defending themselves against ongoing insults, they might not be wrong. But in friendships, even if someone is being mean, responding with a personal attack can backfire. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a better way to respond. The author was defensive and wanted to stop the insults, but the method might have been inappropriate. So leaning towards A.\n"
