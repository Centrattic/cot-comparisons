It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been divorced five times, each time with a different father for her kids, and none of them pay child support. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author over two years. The author, after trying to brush off the insults, finally responded by pointing out that the friend's situation with five kids and no support is making it hard for her to find someone. Now the mutual friends are saying the author was wrong, mentioning things like skinny privilege and entitlement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making personal attacks, and the author felt attacked and finally snapped back. The key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and untrue, like implying the author's success is only due to being skinny or being a blonde. The author's response was pointing out a factual aspect of her friend's life that could be a barrier to her finding a partner. \n\nBut then there's the reaction from mutual friends. They're saying the author is being privileged and entitlement. The author argues that they work hard and aren't entitled. The friend's situation is indeed tough, with five kids and no support, but the author's response was to point out a reality. \n\nI think the author's response was a honest reaction to the friend's insults, but maybe they could have phrased it differently. However, the friend was the one making the initial insults, so the author wasn't wrong to stand up for themselves. The friends' reactions might be based on not seeing the full context of the insults over time. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But I need to check if their response crossed a line. Saying the truth about the friend's situation isn't an insult per se, but it's a hard truth. The friend might have been looking for validation or help, and the author gave a factual response instead. However, given the friend's history of insults, the author's response was a defense mechanism. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was responding to ongoing insults and was truthful, even if the delivery could have been kinder. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. Alternatively, maybe it's A because the author was confrontational. Hmm. I think considering the context, the author's response was justified as a defense against repeated insults. So B is the answer.\n"
