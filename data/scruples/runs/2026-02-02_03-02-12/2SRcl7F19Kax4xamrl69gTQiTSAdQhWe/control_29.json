It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single is in the wrong. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author for two years. The author finally snapped and told the truth about the friend's situation, which led to the friend getting angry and others saying the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a lot of personal and hurtful remarks, and the author tried to brush them off. After two years, the author responded with the truth about the friend's circumstances. The key here is whether the author's response was justified given the prior insults.\n\nThe author's friend was making comments that were not only personal but also untrue. For example, saying the author is skinny when they aren't, and making assumptions about their dating life. The author's response points out the friend's situation as a possible reason she's struggling to find a partner. While that's a factual statement, it might come across as harsh, even if it's true. However, given the history of insults, the author might have felt it was necessary to set a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response might have been a direct attack on the friend's personal life. The author's comment about the five kids and child support isn't an insult per se, but it's pointing out a reality that could affect her dating life. However, it's possible that the friend was already sensitive about that topic, and the author's comment triggered her. Also, the mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, saying the author was entitled. But the author explains they work hard and have a non-traditional job, which might be a valid point.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author did respond truthfully, but in a situation where both parties have been exchanging hurtful comments, it's possible that the author overstepped, even if their friend started it. Friends are supposed to support each other, even if they have differences. However, if the friend was consistently being rude, the author might have had the right to set a boundary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the friend was being mean, the author's response might have been too direct and could have been handled more sensitively. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, B (No) could be correct if it's seen as the author just being honest after being insulted.\n"
