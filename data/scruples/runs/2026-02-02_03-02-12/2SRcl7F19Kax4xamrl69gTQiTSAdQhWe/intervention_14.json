It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend was making insults for two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend's comments were personal and seemed to be trying to make the author feel bad. The author tried to brush them off, but eventually, when the friend kept asking why she can't get dates, the author responded honestly about the kids and child support. The friend got angry, and now mutual friends are calling the author out for being privileged.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. But is that the case? Let's break it down. The author's friend made a lot of negative and possibly untrue comments. The author was defending themselves by pointing out a factual issue that might affect the friend's dating life. However, even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered matters. The author's response was direct and maybe a bit harsh, especially after two years of insults.\n\nBut the friend's insults were low-quality and untrue, as the author points out. The author mentions they work hard, have two kids with one dad, and have a stable income. The friend, on the other hand, has multiple kids with different fathers and no support. The author's response was addressing a real barrier that the friend created for herself. \n\nHowever, in social situations, even if something is true, the delivery and context matter. The author might have overstepped by bringing up personal issues, even if it's the truth. The friend's reaction was strong, and mutual friends side with her, suggesting the author's approach was too direct or hurtful. \n\nBut the author was defending themselves against ongoing insults. The question is whether the response was justified. The author's statement was a factual point that could explain the friend's situation. However, instead of focusing on their own issues, the friend was attacking the author, which might have led the author to finally confront her. \n\nIn terms of friendship, honesty is important, but so is tact. The author might have handled it better by not making it a direct accusation. Maybe they could have said it's difficult for someone in that situation without pointing fingers. But the author's response was a truthful explanation, even if it was blunt. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They were responding to years of insults with a factual point. However, the delivery could have been more compassionate. But in terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
