It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids by different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally responded with honesty. The friends are now saying the author is being mean and has privilege.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's friend was making repeated, hurtful comments that were personal and insulting. The author tried to brush them off before, giving advice like focusing on oneself. But when the friend kept attacking, the author snapped and gave a direct answer.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior was ongoing and hurtful, the author's response was based on a factual observation (the friend's situation with multiple kids and child support), and the author's own work and circumstances are different. The mutual friends are criticizing the author for not being privileged, but the author feels they worked hard and are being unfairly judged.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the author wrong for pointing out the truth? The friend's actions (five kids with different dads, no child support) likely make it harder to find someone. The author's response was honest but might come off as harsh. However, the author had been defending against insults and was tired of being belittled. \n\nThe problem is that even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered could be seen as cruel, especially in a friendship. Friends should support each other, not attack personal issues. The author's response might have been a valid point, but the friend was already in a vulnerable place, and the comment could be perceived as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was clearly problematic\u2014making repeated insults about personal matters. The author's defense of their own life choices and work ethic is also valid. The friends judging the author might not see the full context of the insults the author faced. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author's response was honest and based on facts, but the method of delivery and the timing might be the issue. Friendships require sensitivity, even when the other person is being difficult. The author was trying to set a boundary after being insulted, but the response was direct and possibly hurtful in a way that escalated the conflict.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, sometimes a friend can be wrong for not responding in a more supportive way, even if the other person was being mean. The line between honesty and cruelty is thin here. The author might have tried a different approach, like expressing that the friend's behavior is hurtful without attacking her situation. But since the friend was already being insulting, the author's response might be seen as a justified defense, albeit harsh.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer depends on whether the truth-telling crossed into unkindness. Since the friend's actions were ongoing and the author was defending against insults, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the response was unnecessarily harsh without empathy, then maybe they are. However, given the context of being attacked, the author's response is a reaction to ongoing harm, which might make them not in the wrong. So, I'm leaning towards B (No).\n"
