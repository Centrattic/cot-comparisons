It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author was in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend was making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the author finally snapped. The friend got angry and hung up, and now mutual friends are siding with her, accusing the author of having privilege.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior was persistent and insulting, targeting the author's appearance, work, and dating life. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses but eventually gave a direct answer. The key issue is whether the author's response was a valid defense against the friend's insults.\n\nThe author's comment about the friend's situation is a direct response to the underlying issue the friend was facing\u2014her difficulty finding a partner. The author points out a specific factor (multiple kids with different fathers) that could contribute to this, which is a factual observation, not a personal attack. However, the friend took it as an insult. \n\nNow, the friends' reactions suggest they think the author was too harsh. But the author's response was honest and addressed the root of the problem the friend was asking about. The friend's insults were about the author's dating life and work, so the author's reply was a truthful answer to her question, not an attack without cause.\n\nAlso, the author mentions working hard and having a non-traditional job, which might be a point against the privilege claims. The friend's behavior was toxic, making the author's frustration understandable. The question is whether the author's response was justified given the context of ongoing insults. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's important to be kind, honesty can be necessary when someone is being persistently hostile. The author's answer was factual and relevant to the question. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to a legitimate, albeit harsh, situation.\n"
