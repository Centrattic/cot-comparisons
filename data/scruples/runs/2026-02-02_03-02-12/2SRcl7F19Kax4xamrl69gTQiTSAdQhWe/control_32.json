It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children by different fathers is why she's struggling to find a partner. \n\nFirst, the friend had been making a lot of insincere and possibly hurtful comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush these off for two years. Then, when the friend asked again, the author responded with the truth about her situation with the children.\n\nNow, the key points here are the friend's history of insults and the author's response. The author felt attacked and decided to be honest about the friend's situation. But the friends are now saying the author was wrong because they're calling it \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement. \n\nThe question is whether the author was justified. Well, even if the friend was being mean, the author's response might have been a low blow. It's possible that while the friend was being rude, the author's retort targeted something personal that might be sensitive. The author mentions that the friend's situation is different from theirs\u2014they have two kids with the same dad and a more stable arrangement. The author's job in the adult industry is also a sensitive topic, so maybe the friends feel the author isn't in a position to judge.\n\nBut the author's response does point out a real issue: having multiple children with different fathers without support can impact someone's dating life. However, the way it was said\u2014accusatory and in the middle of a conversation where the friend was already being critical\u2014might have crossed a line. The author was defending themselves, but the timing and method could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are now taking the side of the ex-friend, suggesting that the author's comment was hurtful. The author might have thought they were being honest, but honesty doesn't always mean it's the right thing to say in that moment. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful, but the author's response could have been seen as unkind, even if truthful. \n\nSo, while the friend was definitely in the wrong for the ongoing insults, the author's response might not have been the best approach. They could have handled it differently, perhaps by setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal situation. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014author is in the wrong for the way they responded, even if the underlying issue isn't their fault.\n"
