It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend who has five kids with different fathers, all divorced, and now she keeps making comments that the author finds insulting. The author finally tells her that her situation with the kids is making it hard to find someone, which leads to a fallout. The mutual friends are now telling the author they're being privileged and so on, and the author is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author mentions that their friend has been making low-quality and untrue insults for two years. The author tried to brush them off with generic responses. Then, when pushed again, the author gave a blunt answer about the friend's situation being a hurdle. The friend reacted angrily and hung up. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being privileged, etc.\n\nI should think about whether the author's response was justified. The friend had a history of making hurtful comments, and the author felt attacked. The author's response was to point out a specific issue (multiple kids with different dads) as a reason for the friend's difficulty in dating. However, this might come off as insensitive, even if it's true. The friend might feel that this comment was a personal attack, especially if it's not the only factor affecting her dating life.\n\nAlso, the author's friends are saying that the author is being entitled and not understanding the friend's struggles. The author argues that they are not privileged, but their friends perceive it that way. The author's job in the adult industry and having an MBA might make their friends view them as having advantages or not facing the same challenges. The author's comment might be seen as minimizing the friend's experiences by attributing her single status to a single factor, when there could be many others.\n\nBut then again, the friend was making personal attacks too. The author was defending themselves and giving a truthful answer to why someone might be hesitant. However, the way it was delivered could be seen as harsh. Maybe a better approach would have been to address the friend's insecurities or the insults without directly pointing out the kids as the issue. The author might have overstepped by being direct and causing offense, even if their intention was to be honest.\n\nAnother angle: the author's response could be seen as the last straw after years of insults. The friend's own behavior might have contributed to the breakdown. But the mutual friends are taking the side of the author's friend, which complicates things. The question is whether the author's response was a justified defense or if they crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the friend was being rude, responding with a blunt truth might not be the best approach. There's a difference between honesty and being hurtful. The author might have been right to feel that their friend was being unfair, but the way they responded could have been more empathetic. Maybe pointing out the issue in a supportive way instead of a direct accusation.\n\nAlso, considering the author's own background: two kids with one father, split custody, working in the adult industry. They might have their own experiences with single parenthood and societal judgment. However, the friend's situation is different (five kids, different dads), so the author might not fully understand the complexities of the friend's life. This could lead to a lack of empathy in the response.\n\nSo weighing all these factors: the friend was making personal attacks, the author felt cornered and responded truthfully but bluntly, causing further conflict. The mutual friends think the author is being privileged, but the author feels they're not. The key is whether the response was an appropriate defense or if it was crossing a line. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they responded in a way that, while honest, was hurtful and didn't consider the friend's perspective, even if the friend was being rude. However, if the friend was being abusive, the author might have a case for self-defense. It's a tough call, but in many social contexts, even if someone has been rude, a blunt response can be seen as the problem.\n"
