It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because of having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making a lot of insults towards the author for two years. The friend's comments are not just about their own situation but are personally attacking the author's appearance and work. The author kept brushing off the insults, trying to give advice like focusing on oneself. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the kids and child support as a reason for her difficulty in finding a partner.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The author felt insulted and was tired of being targeted, so they called out the friend's specific behavior. But does that make it okay to be honest in that way? Also, the mutual friends are now saying the author is privileged and doesn't understand what the friend is going through. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if the friend was making the author uncomfortable, the author's response might have been too direct and could come across as judgmental. The friend might have been in a vulnerable state, and pointing out her situation could have been hurtful, even if the author believed it was true. The friend's actions (divorces, single parenthood) don't necessarily define why she's having trouble finding a partner, but the author's statement assumes that this is the main issue. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for standing up for themselves after being insulted, but the way they responded could have been more considerate. Maybe a better approach would have been to address the insults without attacking the friend's personal choices. The question is whether the author had the right to make such a personal comment in response. \n\nAlso, the author's friend was already in a bad place, and the author's reply might have been the last straw. While the friend's behavior was unacceptable, the author's response could have been more constructive. So it's a mix of both. The author might not be entirely wrong for defending themselves, but the method could have been better. However, based on typical AITA standards, being direct and personal might be seen as the problem. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the friend was being an ass, the author's response was unkind and possibly not the best way to handle it.\n"
