It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers is why they're having trouble finding a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend has been making repeated, insulting comments about the author's dating life and work. The author has been trying to brush them off, but eventually responds with a truthful statement about the friend's situation. The friend then gets upset, and mutual friends are now side-eyeing the author, implying they're privileged and in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior over two years of constant insults, the author's response being the truth they observed, and the mutual friends' reactions. \n\nI should consider if the author's response was a valid defense. The friend was making personal attacks, so the author might feel justified in pointing out the obvious reality of the friend's situation. However, even if the statement is true, it's possible that it came across as harsh or insensitive. \n\nThe friend's history of five marriages and children with different fathers could be a sensitive topic. The author's comment might touch on societal judgments, which can be hurtful regardless of intent. But the author was defending themselves from ongoing insults, which adds context. \n\nAlso, mutual friends are criticizing the author for \"privilege\" and entitlement. That might be because the author's response was direct and addressed the root cause of the friend's issues, but friends might not see the prior context of the insults. They might only see the outcome.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want an external perspective. I need to weigh whether the truth was a fair response to two years of insults. \n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's actions were unacceptable, the author's response, although truthful, might have been confrontational. However, given the friend's history, the author might have had enough and acted in self-defense against the constant negativity. So, the answer would be B (No), they're not in the wrong.\n"
