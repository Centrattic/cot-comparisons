It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making a lot of comments that the author feels are insulting. The author has been brushing off the insults for two years but finally responds with a comment about the friend's situation. Now the friend is upset, and mutual friends are side-eyeing the author.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's comments were hurtful and personal, the author responded with a truthful but blunt comment, and others are now saying the author is being privileged and a bad friend. \n\nThe author's defense is that the friend was being rude and that they were just telling the truth. But the problem is that even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered can matter a lot. Telling a friend that their situation is why they're single might be seen as blaming them for their own problems, which could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are saying things like \"skinny privilege\" and that the author is entitled. Even if the author feels they're not privileged, others might not see it that way. The author's job in the adult industry and having an MBA might make others perceive them as having advantages, even if that's not the author's reality.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author was tired of being insulted and wanted to set boundaries. But responding with a comment that could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life might not be the best approach. Maybe there's a more constructive way to address the friend's behavior without making a personal attack.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's response might not have been appropriate. Friends often have disagreements, but how to handle it matters. The author could have addressed the insults by confronting them without making a personal comment about their friend's situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a line by making a personal and potentially hurtful comment, even if the friend was being rude. It's possible there was a better way to handle the situation without causing further conflict. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
