It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's having trouble finding a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making repeated, hurtful comments about the author's appearance, work, and dating life for two years. The author tried to brush them off, giving generic advice each time. Finally, when the friend asked again, the author responded directly by pointing out the friend's situation as a potential issue.\n\nThe main question is whether this response was in the wrong. On one hand, the author was defending themselves against personal attacks and pointing out a factual issue the friend is facing. On the other hand, bringing up the friend's personal struggles might be seen as attacking her, even if it's true. \n\nThe user mentions that the friend has five kids with different fathers and no child support, which could indeed make it hard to find someone. The author's response is honest but might come off as judgmental. However, given the friend's prior behavior\u2014mocking the author's weight, job, and dating life\u2014it's possible the author felt justified in pointing out the elephant in the room.\n\nMutual friends are criticizing the author for \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement, but the author argues they've worked hard and aren't privileged. This suggests a clash in perspectives. The author might not be in the wrong if they were finally standing up for themselves after prolonged insults. However, the way the truth was delivered could have been more compassionate. \n\nAlternatives could include a more empathetic approach, but given the friend's history, the author might have felt it was necessary to be direct. The key points are intent and the nature of the relationship. The author was honest, which isn't wrong, but the delivery might have been harsh. However, considering the context of ongoing insults, the author's response could be seen as a legitimate, if blunt, defense.\n"
