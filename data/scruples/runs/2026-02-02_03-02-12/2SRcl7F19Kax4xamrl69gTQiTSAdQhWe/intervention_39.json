It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author's friend has been through five marriages, each with a different father for her kids, and none of the fathers are paying child support. She's been asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses. Finally, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer about the friend's situation making it hard to find someone. The friend got angry, hung up, and now mutual friends are saying the author is being unkind and has privilege.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior: she's been making comments that are personal and seem to be trying to belittle the author. The author is tired of the insults and finally speaks up. The key point is whether the author's response was justified.\n\nThe author's response was pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her dating struggles. The author isn't blaming her for everything, but stating a fact that having five different fathers and no support might make it harder for someone to commit. That seems like a truthful but harsh response. But was it wrong?\n\nThe friend's comments were personal and maybe a bit envious. The author might have felt defensive and finally snapped. The response, while honest, could have been delivered more sensitively. But the question is whether it's wrong to say the truth. \n\nMutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're being judged unfairly. The author's life isn't easy; they have their own challenges with two kids and a job in a stigmatized industry, even though they have an MBA.\n\nSo is the author in the wrong? Maybe not. The friend was being insulting, and the author was honest. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. But the content of the message was a factual point. The author had a right to be honest, even if it hurt. The friend's behavior was toxic, so the author standing up for themselves isn't wrong. The friends' judgment of the author might be misplaced. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it better. For example, instead of pointing out the issue directly, maybe offering support or suggesting ways to improve the situation. But the friend wasn't open to advice, just insults. \n\nOverall, the author was defending themselves against a friend who was being negative and critical. The author's response was honest and to the point. I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
