It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is single and has five kids with different fathers. The author of the story finally tells her that her situation (five kids with different dads, no child support) is why she's having trouble finding someone. The friend gets upset, and now mutual friends are saying the author is in the wrong because they think the author is privileged and didn't understand the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was justified. The friend had been making hurtful comments about the author's weight, dating life, and job for two years. The author tried to brush off the insults, but eventually, when confronted again, they gave a honest but blunt answer. \n\nThe key points here are the context of the insults and the content of the response. The author's friend had a history of making personal and insulting remarks. The author's response was pointing out a specific issue (multiple children with different fathers and lack of support) as a potential reason for her dating struggles. But is that comment fair or just?\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves after years of being insulted. They might have felt the need to finally address the issue. However, pointing out someone's personal situation as a reason for their social struggles can come off as judgmental and hurtful, even if it's true. It's possible that the author's comment was too direct and didn't consider the friend's feelings, especially given the history of insults.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions might be based on the idea that the author is making a value judgment about the friend's choices. Even if the author believes it's the truth, using someone's personal life against them in a confrontation can be seen as cruel, especially if it's not the first time they've been judgmental.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's friend was already in a vulnerable position, and the response might have been the last straw after two years of insults. The author's intent was to be honest, but the manner and timing might have been inappropriate. Maybe there was a better way to address the friend's issues without being confrontational.\n\nHowever, the friend's behavior was also problematic. She made personal attacks and tried to undermine the author's achievements. The author might have felt they had the right to respond, especially if they felt the insults were unwarranted. But the way they responded could have been more empathetic.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, friends are supposed to support each other, even if they don't agree. The author's response, while honest, crossed into personal criticism, which can damage the friendship. The mutual friends' opinions might be influenced by the idea that the author isn't in a position to judge, regardless of their own situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because their response, even if truthful, was delivered in a way that was hurtful and judgmental, especially after the friend had been making insults. Friends should avoid making personal attacks, even if provoked. The author could have handled it differently by addressing the friend's issues without attacking her personal choices.\n"
