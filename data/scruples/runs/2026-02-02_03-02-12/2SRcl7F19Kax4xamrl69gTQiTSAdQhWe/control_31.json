It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is affecting her dating life. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe friend has been divorced five times and is single, and for two years, she's been making insulting comments towards the author. The author has been trying to brush them off with polite responses. Then, when the friend asks again about why the author has dates at 30 with kids, the author responds honestly that it's because the friend has five kids with different dads and no child support. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong, citing things like skinny privilege and entitlement.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the conversation. The friend has a history of making personal and insulting remarks. The author tried to deflect with advice like focusing on oneself, but the friend kept pushing. The final response from the author points out the friend's situation as a potential barrier to dating. \n\nIs the author justified in pointing out the truth? Well, the friend was asking for the author's opinion, so the author's response is a direct answer. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The author's friend was already in a vulnerable position, and the comment could be seen as judgmental, even if it's a reality check. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are reacting by accusing the author of privilege. The author mentions they work out and aren't skinny, but their friend was mocking their weight. The author also has a non-traditional job, which the friend also mocked. So maybe the friends are trying to deflect or protect their mutual friend. \n\nBut the author was defending themselves after repeated insults. Was it wrong to be honest? The key here is whether the truth was a valid reason for the author's dating success versus the friend's struggles. However, the author's response might have been too direct and could have been phrased more compassionately. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend was asking for honest feedback in a moment of vulnerability (or manipulation), then the author's response, while truthful, might have been too harsh. The fact that mutual friends are criticizing the author suggests that the community values kindness and empathy over blunt honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had been trying to avoid the topic and was finally pushed to give a truthful answer. The friend's behavior was enabling her to avoid taking responsibility for her situation by blaming the author. So maybe the author was right to point out the reality, even if it was uncomfortable. \n\nBut the way it was said could have been better. The author could have expressed the same sentiment in a more supportive way. However, the friend was asking for the truth, not a sugarcoated version. The problem might be in the friend's approach, using personal attacks, and the author's response, while factual, was a direct answer. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the truth was necessary and how it was delivered. Since the author tried to avoid the topic for two years and the friend was being insulting, the author might not be in the wrong for giving a truthful response. However, the delivery might have been a problem. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The mutual friends are saying they are, but maybe they're biased. \n\nIn the end, the author's response was honest and addressed the root cause the friend was asking about, even if it was harsh. So maybe the answer is B for No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
