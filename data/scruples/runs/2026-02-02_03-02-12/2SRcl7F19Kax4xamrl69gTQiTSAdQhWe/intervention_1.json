It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend has been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author finally snaps by pointing out the friend's situation. The friend then reacts angrily. The mutual friends now side with the friend, saying the author is being privileged and inconsiderate.\n\nThe key points here are the ongoing insults from the friend and the author's response. The author mentions that the friend was making untrue and low-quality comments, and the author felt it was the truth that the friend's situation complicates finding someone. \n\nBut when someone is being insulted, is it okay to retaliate with a truth that could be hurtful? Even if the author's statement is factually accurate, the delivery and context matter. The friend was in the middle of a conversation where she was already being critical, so the author's response might have been a direct hit. However, the friends think the author is privileged, which complicates things. Maybe the author's statement was a valid truth but delivered in a way that felt attacking instead of supportive.\n\nAlso, the author's friend had a history of making comments that were both untrue and personal. The author was defending their own situation, which could be seen as a form of self-defense in the conversation. However, pointing out someone's flaws in a harsh way can damage relationships, even if it's the truth.\n\nAnother angle: the author's job in the adult industry is a sensitive topic. The friend was also trying to do similar work, so maybe there's some jealousy there. The author's statement might have cut to the core of the friend's insecurities, leading to the fallout.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends are supposed to be supportive. If the author's response was a honest opinion but came off as cutting, it's possible they overstepped, even if the friend was being mean first. But the friend's behavior was also questionable, making it a two-way issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author was responding to years of insults, but the truth can be a harsh weapon. The answer might depend on whether the author's response was constructive or just retaliatory. Since the author's comment was a direct truth but delivered in a confrontational way, maybe they are partially at fault. However, considering the friend's prior behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the author's statement was factual and addressed the root cause the friend's situation, even if it hurt, maybe they aren't wrong. But in terms of friendship dynamics, being honest but blunt can be seen as cruel, hence maybe the author is in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is leaning towards B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. It's a bit of a gray area, but the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The key is whether the response was justified given the context of the friend's prior behavior. Since the friend was the one making the insults, the author's response might be seen as a reasonable truth-telling, even if it's harsh. So B.\n"
