It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers is why she's still single. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of making personal and insulting comments about the author. The friend's questions are not just casual but seem to target the author's appearance, job, and dating life. For example, she says things like \"How did you get a man at 30 with kids? It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny\" and mocks the author's eating habits. She also brings up the author's work in the adult industry and implies they're only interested in sex. The author feels these comments are untrue and harmful.\n\nThen, when the friend becomes defensive and asks why she can't get dates, the author responds by pointing out the five kids with different dads and the lack of child support. This makes the friend angry and she hangs up. The author's intention was to be honest, but the friend took it as an insult. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are entitled, even though the author works hard and has their own challenges.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend has been making personal attacks, and the author is retaliating by bringing up the friend's situation. The author might feel justified because the friend has been insulting them, but the problem is that the author's response is a personal attack as well. Even if the comment is true, calling out someone's personal life, especially in a direct and potentially judgmental way, can be hurtful. It's possible that the author's response, while honest, was not kind or supportive, which might have made the situation worse.\n\nThe friend's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014she's been attacking and mocking the author for two years. However, the author's response might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe a better approach would have been to set boundaries, explain that the comments are hurtful, or avoid engaging. Instead, the author chose to confront the friend with their own truth, which could come off as harsh. The mutual friends might see the author as having given their honest opinion but in a way that's not constructive, leading them to side with the friend. \n\nI should also consider cultural and social contexts. Discussing someone's reproductive choices or family situation can be sensitive. Even if it's true that having five kids with different fathers might affect someone's dating life, stating it directly could be seen as blaming the victim. The author might have a point in that the friend's actions have real consequences, but the way it's delivered could be the issue here. \n\nIn summary, while the friend is clearly the one making the insults, the author's response is also a personal attack. The question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. Since they were trying to be honest but it led to a breakdown in the friendship, it's possible that their approach was not the best, even if the content of their response wasn't entirely incorrect. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they retaliated with a hurtful comment instead of addressing the friend's behavior more constructively.\n"
