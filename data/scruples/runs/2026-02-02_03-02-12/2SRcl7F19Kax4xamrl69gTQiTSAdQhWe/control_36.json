It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children by different fathers is why she's single. The situation involves a lot of back-and-forth, with the friend making comments that the author found insulting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making personal comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life for two years. The author tried to brush off the insults but finally responded with the truth about the friend's situation. The friend then got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are siding with the friend, saying the author had skinny privilege and was being a bad friend.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's persistent insulting behavior, the author's attempt to deflect with polite responses, and the final response that addressed the root issue. The author's statement was factual but might have come off as judgmental. However, given the context of two years of passive-aggressive comments, it's possible that the author was just pushing back against the friend's negativity.\n\nBut I need to check if the author overstepped. The friend's comments were personal and possibly hurtful, but the author's response was direct. While the author's statement might be true, it's possible that the way it was delivered was harsh, especially in a sensitive situation. The mutual friends are reacting by saying the author is privileged, which could indicate that the author's response wasn't considered supportive enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending themselves against ongoing insults. They might feel that they had the right to point out the obvious issue. The problem is that the response might have been too direct and not empathetic enough, even if it's the truth.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes being honest in a harsh way can be seen as cutting, even if the intent is to help. The author might have wanted to help the friend realize the impact of her choices but did so in a way that came across as attacking rather than supportive.\n\nSo, the author is in a tricky spot. They were responding to two years of passive-aggressive comments but might have used a tone or phrasing that was too harsh. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the community views the author's response as unkind, even if it's the truth. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more tactfully, even though they had valid reasons for their frustration.\n"
