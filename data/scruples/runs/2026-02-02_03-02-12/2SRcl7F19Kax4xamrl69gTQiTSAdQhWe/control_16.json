It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because she has five kids with different fathers. The situation seems pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of making hurtful comments, like implying the author is only successful because she's skinny or that guys only like basic blondes. The author tried to brush these off with polite responses. Then, when the friend asks again why the author has dates while she doesn't, the author responds directly about her having kids with different fathers and no child support. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is being unkind and has privilege.\n\nHmm. So, the author's friend was being insulting, and the author finally stood up for themselves. But the author's response was specific to the friend's situation. The friends think the author is privileged and being a bad friend. But the author feels like they're not privileged and that they're being misunderstood. \n\nI need to consider if the author crossed a line. The friend's comments were personal and hurtful, so maybe the author was justified in calling out the friend's behavior. However, bringing up the five kids and child support might be sensitive. Even if it's true, pointing it out in a direct way could be seen as attacking the friend's situation. The author might have responded in kind, matching the friend's insults with a factual but harsh comment.\n\nBut the friend was the one constantly making low-quality insults. The author tried to avoid conflict but finally spoke their mind. The friend's actions and words might have contributed to the conflict. However, the author's response could be seen as cutting and not empathetic. Maybe there was a better way to respond without attacking her past. \n\nThe friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was hurtful and not the right approach. But the author felt they were defending themselves. It's a tough spot. The key is whether the author's response was a reasonable defense or if it escalated things unnecessarily. Since the friend was being insulting, the author might feel they were justified. However, the method of response might have been too harsh, making the author partly at fault. \n\nSo, considering that the author was defending against ongoing insults but used a direct, possibly hurtful reply, it's a bit of a gray area. But the fact that mutual friends are now siding with the friend suggests that the author's response might have been too harsh despite the provocation. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B because the author was standing up for themselves after being bullied. I need to balance both sides.\n"
