It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because of having five kids by different fathers. The friend was making a lot of hurtful comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the friend's situation. The mutual friends are now saying the author is wrong and that they have \"skinny privilege\" or are entitled. The author is defensive, saying they worked hard and aren't privileged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a history of making insulting remarks, which the author tried to brush off for two years. The author's response was direct and honest, pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her single status. The key here is whether the author's response was justified given the prior behavior of the friend.\n\nThe author's statement was a factual observation about the friend's circumstances. The friend has five kids with different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The author suggested that this might make it hard for someone to commit. While this might come off as harsh, it's a truth the author believed and was tired of the friend's insults. The friend's reaction was anger and hanging up, but the author was defending themselves after consistent attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, the mutual friends are criticizing the author for having privilege and being entitled. However, the author mentions working hard for their achievements, which might not be considered privileged. The friend's behavior was toxic, making personal attacks. The author's response, while direct, was a reaction to prolonged negativity. \n\nIt's important to consider intent. The author was trying to be honest after being insulted, which can be seen as self-defense. However, the way it was delivered might have been unkind. But given the context, the author had valid reasons to respond. The mutual friends' judgment might be missing the prior context of the friend's behavior. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were responding to a friend who was making hurtful comments for two years. The author's response was a truthful point, even if it was blunt. The friends' judgment seems to overlook the initial insults. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
