It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her status as a single mother with five kids by different fathers is affecting her dating life. The friend had been making sarcastic and insulting comments about the author's dating life and work, and finally, the author responded honestly. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend's comments seem to be passive-aggressive and possibly rooted in jealousy or insecurity. The author was brushing off the insults for two years, which shows they tried to avoid conflict. When the friend's questions became a pattern, the author felt compelled to respond with the truth they believed was relevant. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author's response was justified. The author's statement points out a factual situation that could logically affect someone's dating prospects\u2014having multiple children with different fathers without child support might make others hesitant. It's not an insult but a direct, albeit blunt, observation. However, the delivery might have been hurtful. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest they see the author as privileged or lacking empathy. The author defends their position by mentioning their own hardships and work ethic. The question is whether the author overstepped by addressing the root cause of the friend's issues, even if it was a sensitive topic. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while honesty is important, the way it's delivered matters. The author might have been within their right to state a truth, but the context of the friendship and the ongoing insults could mean the response was too direct. However, the friend's behavior was also problematic, with two years of insinuations. \n\nThe author's response was a direct answer to the question, which the friend asked again and again. The author wasn't just criticizing; they were offering a possible reason the friend was struggling. The blame here might be shared, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author was the one to finally address the issue after repeated provocation, and their response was a factual explanation, it's more likely they're not in the wrong. The mutual friends might be applying a double standard by focusing on the author's privilege rather than the friend's behavior.\n"
