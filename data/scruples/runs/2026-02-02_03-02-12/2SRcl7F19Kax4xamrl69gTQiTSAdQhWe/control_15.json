It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is single, asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author, after two years of brushing off the insults, finally tells her that having five kids with different dads and no child support makes it hard to find someone. The friend gets mad, and mutual friends are now saying the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and judgmental, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author was trying to be polite and deflect, but after repeated insults, they decided to speak truthfully. The key here is whether the author's response was inappropriate or if they had a right to respond as they did.\n\nThe author's response points out a factual issue the friend is facing\u2014multiple children with different fathers and lack of child support. This is a real challenge because potential partners might be hesitant due to the complexity or the idea of being a \"stepdad\" without financial support. However, bringing up the friend's personal life in a direct way could be seen as attacking her, even if the author believes it's the truth. \n\nThe mutual friends argue that the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled, which might be true if the author's own situation is easier in terms of dating. But the author mentions they work hard, have two kids with one dad, and a stable financial situation. The author's job in the adult industry is controversial, which might add to the friend's insults, but the author thinks they're being truthful.\n\nThe problem here is that even if the author's statement is true, it's still a personal attack. The friend was already being insulting, but the author's response might have crossed a line by directly pointing out her situation. It's possible that the author could have addressed the insults without attacking the friend's personal circumstances. The author might not have considered that the friend's behavior stems from her own insecurities or struggles, and responding with a truth might have been more hurtful than helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was being harassed with insults for two years and finally set a boundary. They might feel justified in standing up for themselves. However, the method of response could be questioned. A better approach might have been to express how the insults made them feel without attacking the friend's personal life. For example, saying, \"Your comments are hurtful and I don't appreciate them,\" rather than pointing out her situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid reason to speak up, the way they did it might have been inappropriate. They could have framed their response differently to address the behavior without attacking the person. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their response, though honest, was a personal attack and could have been handled more constructively.\n"
