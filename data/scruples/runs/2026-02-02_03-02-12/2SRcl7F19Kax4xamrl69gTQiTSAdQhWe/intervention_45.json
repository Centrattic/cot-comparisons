It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making hurtful comments about the author's weight, job, dating life, etc. The author kept brushing them off for two years. Then, when the friend asked again, the author pointed out the friend's situation with five kids and no child support as a possible reason she's struggling to find a partner. The friend reacted angrily and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to say that. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author's friend was being insulting, and the author finally responded with a truthful but blunt comment. The author believes the friend's situation is a barrier. But the friends are now taking the author's side in some cases, or maybe not. Wait, the mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and a bad friend. The author is defending themselves by saying they work hard and aren't privileged. \n\nIs the author justified in their response? Well, the friend was being insulting, so the author might feel they had a right to respond. However, making a comment about someone's personal life, especially when it's sensitive (like having multiple children with different fathers) can be seen as hurtful. Even if it's true, it's a personal matter. \n\nThe author's intention was to point out a possible reason the friend is struggling, but maybe it came across as judgmental. The friend might feel criticized for her life choices. Even if the author's statement is factually true, it's possible that it was delivered in a way that was hurtful, given the context of the friend's previous insults.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are now blaming the author for being privileged. That suggests that maybe the friends perceive the author's comment as insensitive, even if the author felt they were being truthful. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes even if someone is being insulted, responding with a blunt truth about their personal life might be seen as crossing a line. The author might have been justified in feeling frustrated, but the way they responded might not be the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, if the friend was making untrue or low-quality insults, the author might feel they have a right to respond with the truth. However, even if the insults are untrue, responding with a personal truth about the friend's situation could be seen as taking the conversation to a more hurtful level.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's behavior. The friend kept making these comments for two years, so maybe the author was within their right to finally address the core issue. But maybe there was a more tactful way to do it without being so direct. \n\nIn summary, the author's response might be truthful, but whether they're in the wrong depends on how their message was delivered and the impact. The friends perceiving them as privileged might indicate that the author's comment, while based on truth, was delivered in a way that's seen as judgmental. So, there's a case for the author being in the wrong (A) because even if the friend was being insulting, the response was personal and could be seen as attacking her situation. But there's also a case for the author not being in the wrong (B) because they were responding honestly to a friend who was making untrue comments. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was a direct attack or a truthful response to an attack. If the author was defending themselves and pointing out a legitimate issue in a respectful way, maybe not. But since they did it in a way that was blunt and possibly hurtful, some might see it as in the wrong. But others might see it as a justified response after repeated insults. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might be B (no), but some might argue A (yes) because it's still a personal attack. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B because the author was responding to ongoing insults and giving a truthful answer to a question that the friend asked, but maybe there's a better way to phrase it. The friends' reactions are part of the context, but the author's intent was to be honest. So, maybe not in the wrong.\n"
