It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend was being insulting, and the author finally snapped. The mutual friends are now saying the author is privileged and in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author tried to brush them off. The friend's comments were personal and cutting, like implying the author got a man because she's skinny or that guys only want basic blondes. The author's response was direct about the friend's situation with the kids and child support.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, the author was defending themselves after repeated insults. They felt they had to be honest. On the other hand, bringing up the friend's personal issues about having multiple kids could be seen as attacking her, even if it's true. \n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege,\" which the author denies. The author's response might have been the truth, but it's possible that it came across as judgmental or hurtful, especially given the friend's history. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like setting boundaries without being confrontational or addressing the insults in a non-accusatory way.\n\nAlso, the author's friend seems to be struggling with her own issues, and the author's response might have been the last straw. Even if the truth is valid, the way it's delivered matters. The author might have overstepped by pointing out the friend's problems in a way that was more about defending themselves rather than empathizing.\n\nBut then again, the author was tired of the insults and felt it was time to stand up for themselves. The challenge is balancing honesty with empathy. It's possible that the author wasn't in the wrong, but maybe there was a better way to respond. However, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the community perceives the author as having made a mistake, possibly because the response was too harsh or judgmental, regardless of the intent.\n\nIn the end, while the author had reasons for their response, the method might have been inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their response, though truthful, was likely hurtful and didn't address the underlying issues constructively. Alternatively, if the truth was necessary, maybe B (not in the wrong). But given the social context and the reactions, A seems more likely.\n"
