It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids by different fathers. The friend had been making a lot of insults over two years, and the author finally responded with what they considered the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was repeatedly making comments that were both personal and insulting. The author tried to brush them off with polite replies but eventually snapped. The key point is whether the author's response was justified given the context of prior insults and the ongoing situation.\n\nThe friend's comments were about the author's weight, job, and dating life, which might touch on sensitive topics. However, the author's response pointed out the friend's specific situation regarding multiple children and child support, which could be a legitimate factor in her difficulty finding a partner. The author's statement was factual and highlighted a real issue the friend has, rather than just attacking her personally.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. But the author explains their own challenges, like working in a non-traditional job and having an MBA. They also mention that the friend tried the same job, which might indicate the friend is critical of the author's work without understanding the effort involved.\n\nFrom a communication perspective, even if the author's statement is true, the timing and delivery might have been problematic. However, given that the friend had been making persistent, hurtful comments, the author's response could be seen as a defense of their own dignity rather than an attack. The author was tired of being insulted and finally stood up for themselves.\n\nIt's also important to note that the friend's behavior was ongoing and part of a pattern. The author's response was a direct address of the root cause of the friend's situation, which might be harsh but honest. The friend's reaction was to escalate into insults and hang up, which suggests that the author's message, while blunt, might have been necessary for their own self-respect.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's response, while direct, was in reaction to a long line of insults. The author's truth-telling, though potentially uncomfortable, was a response to a friend who had been consistently disrespectful. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
