It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. The situation involves a lot of back and forth between the two friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting and low-quality. The author has been trying to brush them off for two years but finally snaps and tells the truth they believe is the reason for her situation. The friend then gets angry and cuts off the author.\n\nNow, the author's response was to point out the friend's history with multiple partners and child support issues. The key here is whether that was a fair and appropriate response. The author's intent was to be honest, but in a way that might come off as harsh. \n\nThe author mentions that the friend has been making untrue and insulting remarks about the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author's response addresses a real issue that the friend might face, but it's delivered in a way that could be seen as judgmental. The author's own situation is different because they have two kids with one father, so their perspective might not account for the complexities the friend faces.\n\nThe mutual friends criticize the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they aren't privileged, but the friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was hurtful and not empathetic. The author's honesty might have been a valid point, but the delivery and context matter. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, they were responding to years of insults and being truthful about a factor that could affect the friend's dating life. On the other hand, the response might have been unkind and could have been phrased with more compassion. The fact that the friend took it as an insult and the mutual friends side with her suggests that the approach was problematic. Maybe there was a more constructive way to address the issue without being so direct and judgmental.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for how they delivered the message, even if the content had some truth. It's about empathy and communication style. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
