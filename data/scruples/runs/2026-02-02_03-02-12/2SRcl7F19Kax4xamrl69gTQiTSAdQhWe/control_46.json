It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has five kids by different fathers and is single, recently divorced. The friend has been making comments to the author that are insulting, implying that the author's success in dating is because she's skinny, a blonde, etc. The author has been brushing it off until finally saying that the friend's history of multiple kids with different dads and lack of child support is making it hard for her to find someone. The friend got angry, hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has a pattern of making hurtful comments, possibly rooted in her own insecurities or frustrations. The author, after enduring this for two years, responds with a truthful but potentially cutting remark. The key points are whether the author's response was justified and if it crossed a line.\n\nThe author's friend made personal and possibly untrue insults about her weight and lifestyle. The author's response points out the friend's situation as a reason for her dating difficulties. While the statement might be true, it's a sensitive topic. People often don't appreciate others pointing out their flaws, even if it's factual. However, the friend had been making similar barbed comments, so maybe the author felt justified.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are saying the author is being unkind and has privilege. The question is whether the author's response was an overreaction. The friend's behavior was clearly toxic, but the author's response might have been too harsh. Even if the friend was wrong, the way the author delivered the truth could be seen as attacking rather than offering support. Maybe there was a better way to address the issue without being so direct.\n\nAlso, the author mentions working hard and having a legitimate income, which might add context that they aren't being privileged. But the friends are perceiving it as such. It's possible that the author's response was honest but not delivered in a compassionate way. The friend's situation is complex, and pointing out a potential barrier might come off as unsupportive, especially if it's not the whole story.\n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, when someone is consistently negative and critical, the appropriate response can vary. However, publicly or bluntly pointing out their issues without empathy might damage the relationship further. The author was tired of the insults and wanted to set a boundary, which is understandable, but the method might have been too direct.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the author's response was truthful but possibly harsh. The friend's behavior was wrong, but the author's method might have been inappropriate. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was not well-received. Therefore, the author might be at least partially at fault for not handling it more sensitively. There could have been a better way to address the friend's behavior without making the same type of judgment.\n"
