It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single might be due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's appearance, dating life, and job. The author, after years of putting up with this, finally responds honestly, pointing out the friend's situation. The friend then gets angry and cuts off the conversation. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior over two years, the author's response, and the reactions from mutual friends. The author felt they were being insulted and decided to address the root of the problem they saw. But others are saying it's not okay to point that out.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was justified. The friend's comments were personal and hurtful. The author might have felt that their friend's comments were rooted in her own issues, so pointing that out was a way to defend themselves. However, bringing up the friend's having five kids by different fathers is a sensitive topic. Even if true, it's a personal matter and could come off as harsh. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is privileged, which suggests that the author's response was perceived as judgmental or not empathetic. The author might have thought they were being honest, but maybe they crossed a line by directly linking the friend's relationship status to her personal choices. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. While the friend's comments were unwarranted, the author's response could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life. Even if the author believes it's the truth, the way it was delivered might not be the best approach. There might have been a more compassionate way to address the underlying issues without shaming the friend. \n\nSo, considering the context, I think the author might be in the wrong because their response, although a reaction to ongoing insults, was a direct and potentially hurtful critique of the friend's personal choices. There's a difference between defending oneself and attacking the other person's personal circumstances. The author's friends are likely reacting because the comment was seen as judgmental rather than supportive.\n"
