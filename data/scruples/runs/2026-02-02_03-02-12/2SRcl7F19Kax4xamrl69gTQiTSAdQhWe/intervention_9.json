It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. The friend has been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author finally responded with her honest opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend's comments are clearly insults, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off, giving advice like \"focus on yourself.\" But after repeated slights, she snapped with a direct response about the friend's situation. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior is toxic and persistent, so the author might have felt cornered. However, pointing out the friend's issues, even if true, might be seen as crossing a line. The friend could perceive it as a direct attack, especially if it's the first time such a topic is brought up.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was hurtful. They mentioned \"skinny privilege\" and that the author is entitled, implying that the response was judgmental. The friend's history with child support and dating issues is personal, and the author might have overstepped by bringing it up, even if it's true. \n\nThe author's background (working in adult industry, having an MBA, etc.) might be a defense, but it doesn't necessarily justify the comment. The question is about the appropriateness of the response, not the validity of the underlying truth. In friendships, even if someone's behavior is hurtful, the way you respond matters. The author was honest, but maybe the timing or method was off. \n\nSo, while the friend was being a jerk, the author's response could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life, which might not be fair. The AITA often depends on whether the response was an appropriate boundary or an overreaction. In this case, the mutual friends' reactions and the friend's emotional response suggest the author might have overstepped, even if she had a point.\n"
