It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two friends: one (the author) has two kids with the same dad, works in the adult industry and has an MBA. The other friend has five kids with different fathers and has been through five divorces. The friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting, so the author finally replies that her friend's situation (multiple kids with different dads) is making it hard for her to find someone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was trying to brush off the insults for two years. Then, when the friend kept asking for advice, the author gave an honest answer pointing out the friend's situation as a possible issue. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being entitled and having \"skinny privilege,\" even though the author isn't actually skinny and is in a healthy weight range. The author feels they worked hard for their success and aren't privileged.\n\nThe key points here are: Was the author's response appropriate? Did they cross a line? The friend was making personal comments about the author's weight, job, and relationships. The author's response was factual but could be seen as a personal attack. Even if the friend's behavior was problematic, the author's response might have been a direct but hurtful way to address it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often give each other advice, but the way it's delivered matters. The author's comment was honest but could come off as insensitive. While the friend's comments were hurtful, responding with a direct critique of the friend's personal life might not be the best approach. The author might have intended to be helpful but the method could have been more compassionate.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was not well-received. The author mentions having worked hard, but the friends' comments about privilege might not be entirely valid, but the author's response might have been too blunt regardless. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If we consider the outcome, the author was honest, but the delivery might have been harsh. In such situations, it's often better to address the issue without attacking the person's personal life. Therefore, the author's response, while honest, could be seen as crossing a line, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
