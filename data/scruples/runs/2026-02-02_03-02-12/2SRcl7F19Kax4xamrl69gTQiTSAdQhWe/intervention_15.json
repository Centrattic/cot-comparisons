It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because she has five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making hurtful comments to the author for two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses, but finally snapped and gave a direct answer about the friend's situation. The friend then reacted angrily and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and were wrong to say that.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author crossed a line. The author's response was honest, pointing out a factor (multiple children with different fathers) that could make it hard to find a partner. The friend's behavior was clearly insulting, but the author's reply was also a personal truth about her friend's situation. \n\nOn one hand, the author had been patient and tried to deflect the insults. When pushed, they gave a truthful answer. They might feel justified because they were on the receiving end of repeated negativity. On the other hand, the author's comment might be seen as insensitive or judgmental, especially if it's not the friend's fault. The friend's situation could be due to circumstances beyond her control, like previous relationships not working out, and the author's comment could be hurtful regardless of the truth.\n\nThe mutual friends think the author is privileged and doesn't understand the friend's struggles. The author argues they've worked hard and aren't entitled. But even if that's true, the response might still be considered harsh. The author's comment might have been a valid observation, but the delivery or timing could be an issue. The friend was already upset and the author's response might have been the final straw.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's history, maybe the author's comment was the only honest answer she got, and she was looking for someone to validate her situation. The author's response might have been honest but not supportive, leading to the friend's anger. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while honesty is valued, so is empathy. The author might have been justified in wanting to stop the insults, but the way they addressed it could be seen as attacking her friend's personal choices. \n\nSo, weighing the options, it's a tough call. If the answer is A (in the wrong), it's because the author was unkind despite the friend's behavior. If B (not in the wrong), it's because they were honest and finally stood up for themselves. The author's situation is complex, but maybe the answer leans towards B, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
