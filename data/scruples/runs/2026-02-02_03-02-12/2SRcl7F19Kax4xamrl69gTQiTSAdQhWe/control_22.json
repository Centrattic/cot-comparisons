It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers makes it hard to find someone. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making hurtful comments for two years, insulting the author's appearance, work, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off, but when the friend kept pushing, they finally responded by pointing out the friend's own issues.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend was being insulting and dismissive, so the author might have felt they had to defend themselves. However, bringing up the friend's personal situation could come off as attacking or being judgmental, even if it's true. The author's comment might have been a direct response to the insults they were receiving, but it's possible that the way they delivered it was hurtful.\n\nThe mutual friends are now saying the author is being privileged and insensitive. The author might not have considered how their words could be received, even if the friend's actions were problematic. Sometimes, responding with a similar attack can escalate the situation, even if the original comments were hurtful.\n\nBut the author also mentions they have worked hard and aren't entitled. They might feel that their response was a factual point rather than an insult. However, the way the friend is portrayed\u2014being single and having multiple children\u2014could be seen as a sensitive topic. The author's response might have crossed a line by focusing on the friend's personal life as a reason for their struggles, which could be perceived as blaming the victim.\n\nI need to consider if there's a better way to respond. Instead of pointing out the friend's issues, maybe setting boundaries or not engaging with the insults could have been more effective. However, the author was exhausted from years of being insulted, so their reaction might be understandable from their perspective.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's behavior was clearly hurtful, the author's response might have been too direct and contributed to the deterioration of the friendship. It's possible that the author overstepped by making a judgment about their friend's personal life, even if it was a response to their own attacks. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing nuances.\n"
