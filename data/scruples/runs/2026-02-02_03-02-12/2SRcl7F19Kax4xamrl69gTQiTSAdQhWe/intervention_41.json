It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and no child support. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend was making personal attacks, comparing the author's lifestyle, and making hurtful remarks. The author had been trying to brush it off with polite responses. Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for being single. The friend got upset and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior was persistent and hurtful, the author's response was truthful but direct, and there's a clash in their life choices. The author has two kids with the same dad, works in a non-traditional job but also has an MBA, which might explain their frustration. The mutual friends' reactions seem to be more about the way the author expressed the truth rather than the content.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author had the right to express their opinion, especially after enduring ongoing insults. However, the method of delivery and the specific truth told might have been too harsh. The author's response was factual but could be seen as judgmental. The friend's issues with child support and relationships are real, but the author's directness might have crossed a line, even if the intent was to be honest.\n\nBut considering the friend had been attacking the author for a long time, maybe the author's response was a justified moment of standing up for themselves. However, the impact on the friendship and the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the approach might not have been the best. The author could have found a kinder way to address the issue without being so blunt.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's truth was valid, but the delivery might have been hurtful. The friend's behavior was disrespectful, but the author's response might have escalated things unnecessarily. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for speaking their mind, but they could have handled it more tactfully. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer depends on whether the response was acceptable, then maybe B (not in the wrong) is the choice, but there's room for nuance.\n"
