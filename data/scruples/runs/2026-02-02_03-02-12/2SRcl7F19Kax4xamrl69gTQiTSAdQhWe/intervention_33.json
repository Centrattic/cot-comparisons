It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her friend that her multiple children with different fathers are likely making it hard for her to date. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making repeated, insulting comments about the author's appearance, job, and dating life for two years. The author has tried to brush them off but eventually responded with what she believes is the truth about her friend's situation. The friend then reacted angrily, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior. She made multiple insults over two years, which is a long time. The author's response was a factual observation about her friend's life choices, which the friend took as a personal attack. The mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting the author had \"privilege\" and was \"entitled.\"\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the intent and the nature of the comment. The author was responding to ongoing insults and finally called out the friend's situation. While the comment might be seen as harsh, it was a truthful statement about the friend's circumstances. However, friends often don't appreciate being called out on sensitive topics, even if it's true.\n\nBut the author has a right to set boundaries. If the friend was consistently rude, the author's reaction could be justified as self-defense in the conversation. On the other hand, the author's response might have been tactless, even if truthful. The mutual friends' reactions indicate that the author's comment was hurtful, even if it was based on reality.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a gray area. The friend's behavior was clearly problematic, but the author's response might have been an overreaction in the way it was delivered. However, since the author was defending herself against two years of insults, it's possible she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but with the understanding that communication style matters. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because the comment could be seen as judgmental, even if true. \n\nI think the key here is that the author was tired of being insulted and finally stood up for herself. While the response could be phrased more sensitively, the content itself was a factual observation. So the author isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it better.\n"
