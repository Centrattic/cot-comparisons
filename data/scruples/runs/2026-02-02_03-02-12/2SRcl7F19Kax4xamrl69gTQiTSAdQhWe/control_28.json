It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different dads is why she's still single. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The friend has been making repeated comments that the author finds insulting. Examples include comments about the author's weight, dating life, and job. The friend also tried to do the same job as the author. The author has been trying to brush off these insults with polite responses but finally snapped and gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her being single.\n\nThe friend then got angry, hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're not privileged and have worked hard, which adds to their frustration.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong by telling the friend the truth about her situation. Let's break it down. The friend's comments were personal and hurtful, so the author was defending themselves. However, the author's response was direct and pointed out the friend's circumstances, which might have been hurtful in return.\n\nIn terms of friendship, it's important to consider intent and the nature of the response. The author was tired of the insults and tried to be honest. But maybe the way they delivered the message was harsh? The friend's behavior might have been problematic, but the author's response could have been seen as cutting off the friendship in a public way, leading to the mutual friends turning against them.\n\nAlso, the author's friend has five kids with different fathers, which is a significant life situation. The author's comment about that being a barrier to finding someone might be true, but it's a sensitive topic. Even if it's true, bringing it up in the heat of the moment could be seen as unkind, especially if the friend is already struggling.\n\nThe author might have been justified in feeling hurt and wanting to set boundaries, but the method of doing so might have been inappropriate. Maybe there's a better way to set boundaries without being confrontational. The author could have expressed their feelings without attacking the friend's situation, which might have led to a more constructive conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's constant insults were low and untrue, so the author had a reason to speak up. However, the author's response might have been too direct and hurtful, leading to the fallout. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was seen as crossing a line, even if the friend was wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were responding to ongoing insults, but their approach might have been too harsh. However, in terms of friendship dynamics, calling out a friend in such a direct way without considering their feelings could be seen as the wrong move. So, the answer might be that the author is partially in the wrong because they could have handled it more gracefully.\n"
