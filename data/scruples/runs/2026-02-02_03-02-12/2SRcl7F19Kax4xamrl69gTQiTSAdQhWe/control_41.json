It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of insults towards the author for two years, commenting on her weight, job, dating life, etc. The author has been trying to brush them off with positive responses. Then, when the friend asks again why she can't get dates, the author responds that it's because of her having five kids with different dads and no child support. The friend gets angry, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend was insulting the author repeatedly, the author finally responds with a direct answer that they believe is the truth, and now the author is being blamed by friends. The author is defensive, arguing they're not privileged and worked hard.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author was wrong. The friend's behavior was problematic\u2014making personal and insulting comments. The author tried to avoid confrontation but eventually set a boundary. However, the author's response was a direct accusation about the friend's personal life, which could be seen as harsh, even if true. \n\nFriend dynamics matter. Even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response might have been too direct. Friends might perceive it as cutting or judgmental, regardless of the truth. The author's intention was to be honest, but the delivery could have been hurtful. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the comment crossed a line, possibly because it's a sensitive topic (child support, multiple partners) and might not be the friend's main issue. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend tried to do the same job, which might imply some jealousy. The author's response could be seen as pointing out a reality the friend was avoiding, but in a way that's not supportive. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's response might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, while the friend was definitely in the wrong with the insults, the author's response might have been too blunt. There could have been a more supportive way to address the issue without being confrontational. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not handling it more tactfully.\n"
