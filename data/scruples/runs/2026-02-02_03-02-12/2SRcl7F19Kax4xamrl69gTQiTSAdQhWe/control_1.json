It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids from different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend has a history of making insulting comments towards the author about their appearance, job, and dating life. The author has repeatedly tried to brush off these insults with advice to focus on themselves. However, when the friend continues to attack, the author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in finding a partner.\n\nNow, the key points here are the context of mutual insults and the nature of the author's response. The friend has been making personal, sometimes untrue, comments. The author's response, while honest, could be seen as a direct criticism of the friend's past choices. But considering the friend's behavior over two years, the author might feel justified in defending themselves.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author has been a target of insults, and the response was a reaction to that ongoing pattern. However, calling someone out for their personal choices, even if it's the truth, can come across as harsh, especially if it's the first time the author has addressed it. But given the history, maybe it's a justified stand-up for oneself.\n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the author, but the author feels they have worked hard and aren't privileged. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate. In some cases, pointing out someone's issues in the context of their own problems might be seen as valid if it's part of a mutual support dynamic. However, if the author's comment was more of a personal attack rather than constructive feedback, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, but they mention they have an MBA and another job, which complicates the narrative about privilege. The friends' reactions suggest they might not see the author's hard work, but the author feels they are being unfairly judged.\n\nIn terms of social norms, calling a friend out for their past decisions in a heated moment can be seen as crossing a line, even if the truth is true. The author might have been within their rights to finally speak up after being insulted repeatedly, but the method could have been more diplomatic.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer hinges on whether the response was a justified defense or an overreaction. The author's history with insults might make their reaction understandable, but the directness of the truth could still be seen as hurtful. However, given the context of ongoing insults, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), but there's nuance.\n"
