It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's still single. The friend was making a lot of hurtful comments about the author, which the author tried to brush off for two years. Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out her situation.\n\nFirst, the friend's comments were clearly mean and insulting. The author was defending themselves after a lot of verbal attacks. But when they responded by pointing out the friend's situation, the friend got upset. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author points out they work hard and have a different lifestyle.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was fair. The friend was making low-quality, untrue insults, so the author's response was a factual point. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The author was honest, but maybe they could have been more empathetic. The mutual friends might feel the author was judgmental instead of supportive, even if the friend had it coming. The author's intent was to stop the insults, but the method might not have been the best. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because even if the friend was mean, responding with a direct criticism without empathy could have been hurtful and not the best approach.\n"
