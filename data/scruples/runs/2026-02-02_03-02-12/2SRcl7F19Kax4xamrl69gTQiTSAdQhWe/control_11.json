It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend with five children from different fathers, all divorced, and she's been making a lot of insults towards the author for two years. The author finally responds by pointing out that having five kids with different dads might be a barrier to finding a partner. The friend then gets upset, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and were wrong to say that.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior: she's been making personal, insulting comments for two years. The author tried to brush them off, but eventually, they snapped back. The key issue here is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to handle the insults or if it was an overreaction or insensitive.\n\nThe author's response was to call out the friend's situation as the reason for her being single. Now, the friend's situation is complicated. Having multiple children from different fathers and no child support is a legitimate challenge, but the author's comment might come across as judgmental. The mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged, which might be because they're implying the author's own path was easier. The author argues they worked hard and aren't privileged, but the friends' reaction might stem from the perception that the author is blaming the victim.\n\nThe question is about whether the author crossed a line. Even if the friend was being rude, responding with a personal truth could be seen as attacking her situation, which might be a sensitive topic. The author's comment, while possibly true, could be hurtful and not the best way to handle the friendship. The author might have a right to feel defensive, but the way they responded might have been counterproductive. It's possible that a better approach would have been to set boundaries without directly attacking the friend's circumstances, or to not engage at all if the insults were too hurtful.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's response was a direct confrontation of the friend's situation, which could be seen as unkind or judgmental, even if the friend was insulting. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But there's nuance here. The friend was being rude, but the author's response may have been a justified defense. However, in terms of maintaining friendship and not adding to the hurt, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
