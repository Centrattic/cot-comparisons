It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is making it hard to get a partner. The friend had been insulting the author for two years, and finally the author responded honestly. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend was repeatedly making derogatory comments, which the author tried to brush off. The author's response was direct about the friend's situation. The key here is whether the author crossed a line despite the friend's prior behavior.\n\nThe user mentions that the author's friend had been insulting her for two years, so there's a history of negative interactions. The author's response was factual and linked the friend's difficulties to the five children with different fathers. But the author's friend took it as an insult, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are taking sides, accusing the author of being privileged and not understanding the friend's struggles. The author feels that they're being unfairly criticized and that their response was truthful.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while the author might have had a valid reason to speak up after repeated insults, the way they framed their response could be seen as judgmental. The statement about \"five kids with different dads\" is a sensitive topic and might come off as blaming the victim, especially if the friend's situation is more complex. It's possible that the author's honesty, while truthful, wasn't delivered in a way that showed empathy or understanding.\n\nAdditionally, the author's own situation (different parenting setup, work in a stigmatized industry) might mean they don't fully grasp the friend's challenges. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment could have been hurtful, even if the friend was previously insulting them. \n\nConsidering all this, even if the author's intentions were to be truthful, the approach might have been tactless. The question is whether the author's response was justified given the context. While the friend was rude, responding with a blunt truth might not have been the best approach. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n"
