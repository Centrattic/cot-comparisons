It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their friend that her status as having five kids with different fathers is why she's still single. The friend asked the author how she managed to date with two kids and a job in the adult industry, and the author responded with that comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making insincere and insulting comments for two years. The author tried to brush them off, but eventually, they snapped and gave a honest reply. The response they gave was about the friend's situation making it hard for someone to commit. \n\nThe friend's reaction was a meltdown, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're being misunderstood and that their comment was truthful, not malicious.\n\nNow, the key points here: The friend's behavior was ongoing and hurtful, and the author's response was a direct but honest reaction. However, the comment about having five kids with different fathers is a sensitive topic. Even if it's true, bringing it up in a conversation that starts with the friend's insults could be seen as a low blow. \n\nThe author's friends are saying the comment was inappropriate, which suggests that maybe the approach was wrong, even if the sentiment was truthful. The author might have been better off addressing the friend's behavior in a different way, perhaps pointing out that the insults are hurtful or setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal situation. \n\nBut the author did mention that they were tired of being insulted, so their response was a reaction to that. However, the way they responded could be seen as attacking the friend's character rather than addressing the insults directly. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had a right to feel hurt and to set boundaries, but the method they chose might have been counterproductive. It's possible that the author's comment was the truth but delivered in a way that escalated the conflict instead of resolving it. So, while the author's intent was to be honest, the impact was negative. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the friend was being rude, the author's response crossed a line by targeting a sensitive issue, which likely caused more harm than good. The author might have handled it better by focusing on the friend's behavior rather than making a personal comment about her situation.\n"
