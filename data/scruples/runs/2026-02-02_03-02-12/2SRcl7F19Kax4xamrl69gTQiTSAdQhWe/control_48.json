It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend has been making a lot of insulting comments for two years, and finally, the author responds by pointing out that the friend has five kids with different fathers, which might be affecting her ability to find someone. The friend gets upset and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend has five children from different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The friend has been making personal attacks on the author's weight, appearance, job, and relationship status for two years. The author, after enduring these insults, responds with what they see as the truth. The key question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the friend's personal situation as the reason for her dating struggles.\n\nThe author's response directly addresses the root of the friend's issues, which the author believes is the five children with different fathers. However, even if it's true, pointing this out in the way they did might come off as judgmental or shaming. The friend was already in a vulnerable state, asking for advice, and the author chose to highlight what's likely a sensitive topic. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, it's possible that the delivery was harsh or not considered carefully enough for the friend's feelings.\n\nMoreover, mutual friends are saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement. The author might not see themselves as privileged, but others perceive it that way. The author's job in the adult industry, having an MBA, and working less hours might contribute to this perception. The friends might feel that the author is in a position where they can afford to be critical without understanding the friend's struggles.\n\nIt's also worth considering the pattern of behavior. The friend had been making comments for two years, and the author had been brushing them off. The final response was a direct confrontation, but perhaps there was a better way to address the friend's issues without being judgmental. The author could have offered support or constructive advice instead of pointing out the friend's personal choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending themselves from what they see as low-quality insults and felt that they had the right to respond with the truth. The problem is that the truth might not always be the best approach in a sensitive situation. The author might have intended to help the friend by pointing out what they see as the problem, but the method might have been inappropriate.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was constructive or just a judgmental comment. Even if the statement is true, delivering it in a way that could be seen as shaming or blaming the friend for her choices is likely to be hurtful. The friend was already in a vulnerable position, and the author's response might have crossed a line from being honest to being unkind.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong. They responded with a judgmental statement that, while possibly true, was delivered in a hurtful manner without considering the friend's feelings. There might have been a more supportive way to approach the situation, even if the friend was being confrontational.\n"
