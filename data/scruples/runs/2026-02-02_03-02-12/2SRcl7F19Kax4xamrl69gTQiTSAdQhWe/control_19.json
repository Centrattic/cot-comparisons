It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's dating life and body for two years. The author kept brushing them off, but finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend reacted angrily and hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was justified in giving that honest answer or if it was an overstep. Let's break it down. \n\nThe friend has a history of making personal, possibly hurtful comments. The author tried to deflect with generic advice before. When the friend kept pushing, the author gave a direct answer that they felt was the truth. But the friend took offense, and others are now criticizing the author. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend's comments were insults, so the author might have felt cornered. However, the response the author gave was about the friend's personal issues, which could be seen as a sensitive topic. Even if true, bringing up someone's family situation in a judgmental way can be hurtful, especially if it's not the first time the friend has been critical. \n\nThe mutual friends are accusing the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being unkind. The author's defense is that they worked hard and aren't entitled. But the key here is that the author's response was direct and potentially hurtful in return. Even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response might have been more damaging because it's a personal attack on the friend's life choices. \n\nIn friendships, honesty is important, but timing and delivery matter. The author might have thought they were being truthful, but it's possible that the way it was delivered came off as cruel, especially after a long period of the friend's own insults. However, the friend's comments were also low-quality and untrue, so maybe the author had a right to push back. \n\nOn the other hand, pointing out someone's personal issues as a reason for their problems can be seen as blaming the victim. The friend's situation is complex and not entirely within her control; having multiple children with different fathers might have circumstances that aren't just about her choices. The author's comment might oversimplify the issue, making it seem like the friend is solely responsible for her single status. \n\nAlso, the author's own work in the adult industry and other details might be part of the mutual friends' judgments. If the mutual friends are projecting their own biases, maybe the author's response was more about self-defense. However, friends generally don't take criticism well when it's personal. \n\nBalancing all these factors, the author might have been within their rights to set a boundary and speak their mind, especially after enduring two years of insults. However, the way the truth was delivered could have been more compassionate. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps there was a better way to handle it without causing further hurt. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's response was a direct answer to a direct question, even if it was true, it's possible that they crossed a line by focusing on the friend's personal choices. Alternatively, if the friend's comments were genuinely insulting and the author felt attacked, responding with the truth could be justified. \n\nConsidering typical AITA responses, often the advice is to avoid personal attacks even when being attacked. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they took the insults personally and responded in kind with a personal attack, which escalated the situation. However, the friend's initial comments were also personal, so it's a back-and-forth. \n\nIn the end, the answer might depend on whether the author's response was a proportionate reaction. Since the friend was asking for the truth and the author provided it, but in a way that's sensitive, it's a gray area. However, given that the mutual friends are siding with the friend and the author's response might have been more hurtful, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
