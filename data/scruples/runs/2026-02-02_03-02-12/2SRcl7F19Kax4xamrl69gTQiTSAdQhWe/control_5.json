It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids by different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, the friend has been making hurtful comments about the author for two years. The author kept brushing them off, but finally snapped and gave a direct answer. The mutual friends now side with the friend, accusing the author of having privilege and being a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was responding to years of insults. The friend's comments were personal and targeted the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author's response was a blunt truth about the friend's situation. But the friends are now taking the author's side of the story and judging them. \n\nIs it wrong to tell the truth? Well, even if the truth is true, the way it's delivered matters. The author was defensive after being insulted, so their response was a direct cause-and-effect statement. But could there have been a better way to phrase it without attacking the friend? Maybe. However, the friend's behavior was abusive over time, and the author was defending themselves. \n\nThe author's job and their financial situation are mentioned, which shows they have their own struggles. The friends are quick to judge the author as privileged without understanding their background. The friend's actions (multiple divorces, child support issues) are her own problems, so the author pointing out the obvious might not be wrong. \n\nBut in terms of friendship, honesty is important, but the method and timing matter. The author might have acted in self-defense after years of being insulted. The friends' reactions seem biased, maybe because they weren't aware of the prior context. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were responding to years of abuse and gave a truthful, albeit blunt, response. The friends' judgment isn't justified without knowing the full story. So answer B.\n"
