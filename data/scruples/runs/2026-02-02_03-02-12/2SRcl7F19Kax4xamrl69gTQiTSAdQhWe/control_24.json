It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is affecting her ability to get dates. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author for two years, questioning her looks, job, and lifestyle. The author finally snaps and points out the friend's history with multiple children and lack of child support, which they believe is the real issue. The friend reacts badly, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's previous insults were personal and possibly untrue (\"low quality and untrue\"). The author's comment was a direct response to the friend's question about why the author is successful in dating. The author's answer points out a specific issue the friend has, which the friend hasn't addressed. \n\nBut friendship dynamics matter. While the friend's insults were hurtful, the author's response directly called out the friend's personal life. Even if true, it's a sensitive topic. Friends might see it as crossing a line, especially if the friend hasn't addressed those issues themselves. The friends' reactions suggest they felt the author was being judgmental or using it as an excuse rather than addressing the friend's own behavior.\n\nThe author's response might be seen as honest, but honesty isn't always appropriate if it harms the friendship. The mutual friends' reactions indicate that the author's comment was perceived as privileged or dismissive, even if that's not the case. The author's frustration is valid given the two years of insults, but the choice of response could have been more tactful.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the truth was delivered in a way that was constructive or just hurtful. Since the author's response was a direct attack on the friend's personal life, it's possible they crossed a line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, given the friend's prior behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. But the method of response might still be seen as the problem. Final call: the author is in the wrong (A) because while the friend was being hurtful, the author's response was also a personal attack that escalated the situation.\n"
