It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's single. The friend was being insulting and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and insulting, targeting the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush it off for two years, responding with things like \"focus on yourself.\" Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer about the child support and multiple fathers issue. The friend got angry, hung up, and mutual friends are now taking sides, saying the author is privileged and mean.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend was being consistently insulting, the author tried to avoid confrontation but eventually responded with a hard truth, and the friends are criticizing the author now. The author feels they were just being honest and defending themselves.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the friend's behavior was rude, the author's response addressed a sensitive topic. While the friend's comments were hurtful, pointing out someone's life choices, especially regarding family and child support, can be seen as crossing a line. The author's answer, though truthful, might have been too harsh. The friend's situation is complex, and the author's response might have been more about asserting their own feelings than helping the friend.\n\nMutual friends' reactions also suggest that the author's comment was hurtful. The author might not have considered the friend's perspective or the potential for their words to be damaging. Even if the author felt justified, using a personal truth in response to insults can come off as attacking rather than defending. There might have been a better way to set boundaries without bringing up the friend's personal issues.\n\nSo, while the friend's behavior was inappropriate, the author's response could be seen as an overreaction that targeted the friend's sensitive areas. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
