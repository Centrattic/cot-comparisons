It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids by different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been divorced five times, and over two years, she's been making hurtful comments to the author about their dating life, implying that the author's success is due to being skinny or other superficial reasons. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation, which leads to a fallout.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication boundaries and the appropriateness of the response. The author mentions that they tried to brush off the insults with neutral advice, but when the friend kept pushing, they gave a direct answer. The question is whether that direct answer was in the wrong.\n\nThe friend's comments were clearly personal attacks, which the author found hurtful. The author's response was based on an observation that having multiple children from different fathers might make it hard to find a partner. The friend took offense and hung up. Then mutual friends criticized the author for not understanding privilege.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were defending themselves after being insulted. They felt that the friend's behavior was unwarranted and that their response was honest. The question is about whether the author overstepped by bringing up the friend's personal situation.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone is being attacked, it's common to feel justified in defending oneself. However, the author's response might be seen as pointing out a sensitive issue in a way that could be hurtful. The line between honesty and being hurtful can be thin. The author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to ongoing insults, but they could have potentially handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries without personalizing the criticism.\n\nConsider the context: the friend's behavior was persistent and hurtful. The author tried to ignore it but eventually felt the need to respond. The response was direct and possibly blunt, but it addressed the underlying issue the friend was facing. Whether it's wrong depends on the cultural norms and the relationship dynamics. In some cases, directly addressing the root of the problem is necessary, but it's also possible that the author could have phrased it more sensitively.\n\nMutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was seen as insensitive or privileged. However, the author argues they worked hard and aren't privileged. The key here is whether the author's statement crossed a line into personal criticism that wasn't constructive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have been justified in feeling defensive due to the friend's insults, the response might have been too direct or hurtful. However, considering the friend's prior behavior, the author's response might be seen as a justified defense. The answer might hinge on whether the author's statement was a necessary self-defense or an overreach.\n"
