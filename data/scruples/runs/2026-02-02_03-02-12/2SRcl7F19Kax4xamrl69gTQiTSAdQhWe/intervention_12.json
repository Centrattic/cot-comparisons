It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been going through a lot, having five kids with different fathers and being divorced five times. She's been asking the author a lot of questions that come off as insults, like commenting on her weight and dating life. The author has been trying to brush it off, giving advice like focusing on oneself. But after two years of this, the author finally tells her friend that her situation with the kids and no child support might be why she's having trouble finding someone. The friend gets upset and hangs up. Now the author is getting backlash from mutual friends who say she's being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a friend who has been called out for not being wrong. The friend has a history of making personal and hurtful comments. The author's response was to point out a factual issue\u2014having multiple children with different fathers and no support\u2014that could be a barrier to forming a relationship. Is that a fair and appropriate response?\n\nThe author mentions that the friend's comments were untrue and low-quality. For example, the friend says the author got a man at 30 because she's skinny, but the author clarifies she's not skinny and works out. The friend is also making assumptions about her dating life and job, which the author explains isn't accurate. The author felt that after repeated insults, it was time to address the root cause of the friend's problems rather than just brushing it off.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the nature of the response. The author's statement was meant to be honest and truthful, pointing out a real issue that could be affecting the friend's personal life. However, the way it's delivered might have been harsh, especially if it was unexpected or not framed compassionately. The friend reacted negatively, which the author anticipated by saying it launched her into an insult fury.\n\nNow, considering the mutual friends' reactions\u2014calling the author privileged and a bad friend\u2014does that imply that the author overstepped? The friends might think that the author was being judgmental or not supportive. On the other hand, the author believes they were being truthful and that their own life isn't as easy as others think. The author has her own challenges, like working in the adult industry and managing custody, which might not be as visible to others.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was justified. While honesty is important in friendships, how it's delivered matters. Pointing out a factual situation (multiple children with different fathers) as a potential barrier to relationships is a valid point, but it's also personal and could be sensitive. The author might have done it in a way that felt accusatory or unsupportive, even if the content was true.\n\nAnother angle is that the author was tired of being insulted and finally stood up for herself. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and recurring, so the author's response could be seen as self-defense. However, in a friendship, even when the other person is being rude, it's important to maintain respect and empathy. The author might have been right to address the underlying issue but could have framed it differently to be more constructive.\n\nIn summary, the author's intention was to be honest about a real issue affecting her friend's situation. However, the method of delivery might have been too direct or lacking in compassion, leading to the friend's negative reaction. While the content of the message isn't inherently wrong, the approach could have been better. So, the answer might be a nuanced B (not in the wrong) because the truth was relevant, but with a note that the delivery could have been improved.\n"
