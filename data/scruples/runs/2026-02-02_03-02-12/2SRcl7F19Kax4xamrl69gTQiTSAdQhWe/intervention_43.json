It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally snapped with a truthful response that hurt the friend's feelings. Now mutual friends are saying the author is wrong and has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made repeated insults about the author's weight, work, and dating life. The author tried to brush it off and give advice, but eventually, when the friend kept pushing, the author told her the truth about her situation. The author's point is that the friend's history of multiple children with different fathers might be a barrier to finding a partner because of the stigma or logistical challenges.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The friend was making personal attacks. 2) The author responded truthfully when they were being attacked. 3) The mutual friends are criticizing the author for being insensitive, implying that the author is privileged and not understanding the friend's struggles.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author crossed a line. On one hand, the author was defending themselves after repeated insults and tried to give a realistic answer. On the other, the author's response might have been harsh, even if true, and could be seen as a personal attack. The friend's situation is indeed complex, but the author's comment about child support and finding a father figure might have been too direct and could have been phrased more compassionately.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' criticism suggests that the author's response was perceived as judgmental, which might be true. Even if the author's statement is factually accurate, the way it was delivered could have been hurtful and dismissive of the friend's feelings. The author might have intended to be honest but failed to consider the emotional impact, leading to a breakdown in the friendship.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, sometimes even the truth can be damaging if not delivered with care. The author's frustration is understandable, but responding with a direct critique of someone's personal life, especially when it's sensitive, can be seen as crossing a line. There might have been a better way to address the friend's behavior without making a personal attack. The author could have focused on the friend's need to self-regulate or seek support, rather than pointing out the friend's history as the problem.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's response was a truthful but potentially hurtful reaction to ongoing insults. While they were defending themselves, the method used might have been inappropriate, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, the friends' accusations of privilege might also be overreacting. But based on the friend's actions and the author's response, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively.\n"
