It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend has been divorced five times, has kids with different fathers, and none of them pay child support. She's been making comments that the author finds insulting, like implying the author's success is due to being skinny or being a \"basic blonde.\" The author tried to brush these off, but eventually, when the friend asked again about why she can't get dates, the author responded by pointing out her friend's situation with the kids and lack of child support. The friend got upset and hung up. Now the mutual friends are saying the author was wrong and that they have \"skinny privilege\" and are entitled.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was in the wrong for being honest. Let's think about the dynamics here. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and judgmental. The author tried to be polite and deflect, but after repeated insults, they finally addressed the root issue they believed was causing the friend's problems. \n\nBut maybe the author could have chosen a different approach. Instead of pointing out the friend's situation, maybe a better response would have been to explain that people have different life paths and that the friend's approach might be what's causing issues. However, the author's response was factual\u2014child support and multiple children with different fathers can make it harder to find a partner. So, was the author's response honest but unkind, or did they have a right to call out the friend's behavior?\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are taking the friend's side, suggesting the author is privileged. The author feels they're not entitled, having worked hard. But maybe the friend's situation is more about the challenges she's facing, and the author's response, while true, was not helpful. The author might have overstepped even if the comment was true. \n\nIn terms of friendship, sometimes being honest isn't the best approach when the other person is already in a vulnerable or defensive state. The friend's behavior was problematic, but the author's response might have been too direct and hurtful, even if the truth was valid. The key is whether the method of addressing it was appropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a blunt truth that could have been delivered differently. Even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response might have been too harsh, leading to the fallout. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way they delivered the truth, despite the friend's initial insults.\n"
