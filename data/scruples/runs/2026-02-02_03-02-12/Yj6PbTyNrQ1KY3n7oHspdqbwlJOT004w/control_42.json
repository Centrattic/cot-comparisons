It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship. It got rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading to him financially supporting her. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay but insisted on a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out. Now friends are saying he's being a bad person for not helping the unborn child despite the betrayal.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether he was wrong to do that. Let's consider the factors. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, emotional turmoil. He felt betrayed when the cheating was confirmed. The pregnancy was a surprise, and the paternity test confirmed he's not the father. So, he's not responsible for the child. \n\nBut then there's the argument about the child's well-being. Even if he's not the father, maybe he's being selfish or not considering the child's needs. However, the mother is with her parents and a friend, so maybe there's other support. Also, the mother's parents smoke, which he wanted to avoid, but now she's not with them. \n\nEthically, some might say he should help because the child is vulnerable, but others would argue he's not the father and has his own emotional baggage. He's also under pressure from friends to take her back. But he's justified in not wanting to take care of someone else's child, especially after being cheated on. \n\nThe key points are the paternity result and his emotional state. He's not legally obligated, and the mother is responsible. However, the moral aspect is tricky. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author isn't the father, and he's not at fault for the pregnancy (since it was a lie about paternity), then he's not in the wrong. The cheating and the deception by her might also play into his decision. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on the information he had, confirmed through the paternity test, and his own emotional capacity. The responsibility lies with the mother and the actual father.\n"
