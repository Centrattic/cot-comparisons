It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if the person (the author) was wrong to kick his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, had a rocky end when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading him to break up with her. Then she comes back pregnant, he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test shows he's not the father, and he kicks her out. Now people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, once you know you're not the biological parent, you don't have a legal obligation to support the child. But there's also the moral aspect. The author here isn't the father, so he's not legally bound. However, he might feel some moral pressure, especially if he's been led to believe the child is his. But once the test proves otherwise, his responsibility is lifted.\n\nThen there's the emotional part. The author was in a relationship, thought he was going to be a father, which is a big commitment. The fact that she cheated adds another layer of betrayal. He broke up with her initially because of her job situation and possible cheating. The paternity test confirmed both the infidelity and that he's not the father. So, his decision to kick her out might be a mix of anger and wanting to avoid further emotional entanglement.\n\nBut some might argue that he should still help because the woman is in a vulnerable state. However, the author might feel that he's already given her the benefit of the doubt by allowing her to stay after the initial pregnancy announcement. Once the paternity is known, he's not obligated. Plus, her parents have issues (smoking), so maybe he thought he was helping by letting her stay, but now that he's not the father, it's not his responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the argument about the unborn child. Even if he's not the biological father, if he's been emotionally attached, he might feel conflicted. But legally and morally, he's not responsible. The people who say he's a terrible person might be projecting their own views on responsibility, but the author isn't the father. He's in a difficult position, but he's making a choice based on his own circumstances and the betrayal he experienced.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's not legally responsible, he was deceived, and he's choosing to prioritize his own well-being after a traumatic relationship. While empathy for the situation is important, the decision isn't entirely his to make beyond that point.\n"
