It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves him kicking his pregnant ex-girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. They were together for two years, the relationship was rocky, she lost her job and he was supporting her. He suspected cheating and broke up with her. Then she came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child wasn't his, so he kicked her out. Now, others are criticizing him for not helping the child, even though he feels betrayed and emotionally hurt.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a man is not automatically the legal father unless established through paternity tests or other means. Since the test showed he's not the father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. However, there's an emotional and moral angle here. He might feel a sense of responsibility, but if the child isn't his, does that obligation still exist?\n\nEthically, some might argue that he's being selfish by not helping, especially if the mother is struggling. But he's also dealing with betrayal and the emotional fallout. The mother cheated, and now he's being asked to support a child that isn't his. On the other hand, the woman is in a difficult situation with her parents, and he has the means to help.\n\nAnother angle is the child's well-being. If he's in a position to provide a stable environment, some might say he should take responsibility. But if he's not the father and the mother is capable of caring for the child with help from her friends, maybe his decision is valid.\n\nAlso, the initial breakup was due to her not working and his suspicions of cheating. Now that she's pregnant, perhaps he's in a more stable place financially, but the trust is broken. He might feel that he can't support a child from someone who cheated and isn't contributing financially.\n\nThere's also the aspect of his emotional state. He's been through a lot, and the paternity test confirmed his fears. It's possible he's in a raw emotional state where he can't see beyond his own hurt.\n\nI should also consider if there are any legal obligations beyond paternity. If he's not the biological father, he has no legal duty to support the child. However, in some cases, if he's been acting as the father (like providing financial support), there might be obligations. But in this case, he stopped supporting once he knew the child wasn't his.\n\nThe main question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's more nuanced. Some might argue he's being reasonable given the circumstances, while others might say he's abandoning a vulnerable person.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the fact that he's not the father and the circumstances of their relationship. Since the child isn't his, he's not legally bound to help, and given the cheating and his emotional state, his decision could be seen as valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden ethical obligation here.\n"
