It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out their pregnant ex-girlfriend when they found out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the author and ex had a two-year relationship. The last few months were tough because the ex lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on the author financially. The author suspected cheating and broke up, leading the ex to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant and wanted to stay with the author again. They agreed to a paternity test, which the ex happily accepted. After the test came back negative, the author asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the ex and others are calling the author a bad person for not helping the child. The author feels torn between their emotions and the pressure to take care of the child.\n\nSo, legally, the author isn't the biological father, so they don't have a legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally and morally, it's more complex. The author is dealing with the betrayal of the ex cheating and the emotional toll of a failed relationship. The author also had concerns about the ex's parents' smoking, which is a valid health concern for the child. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the child isn't theirs, the author might feel a sense of responsibility, especially if they were led to believe it was their child. However, the ex did agree to the paternity test, indicating she wasn't forcing the author into a situation without confirmation. Once the test proved he's not the father, the author is no longer bound by that obligation. \n\nThe key points are the agreed-upon paternity test and the author's right to make decisions about their home. The author's actions were based on the test result, which they both agreed to. The author isn't legally or ethically required to house someone else's child, especially under those circumstances. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
