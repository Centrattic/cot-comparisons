It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years but broke up because of job loss and financial issues. The author suspected cheating. Then she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points. The author was already suspicious of cheating, which the test confirmed. He took her in temporarily, but once he found out he's not the father, he didn't want to be involved. The ex and others are saying he should still help with the child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014breakup, suspected cheating, financial strain. He's not responsible for someone else's child. But there's a moral angle here. Even if he's not the father, some might argue he's still in a position where he could help, but others would say it's not his responsibility. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the information he had. He made a decision after the paternity test. While others might think he should help regardless, legally and ethically, he isn't obligated. He's also protecting himself from further emotional and financial burden. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
