It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex-girlfriend is pregnant, but the child isn't his. He kicked her out after a paternity test confirmed that. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the facts: They were together for two years, then she left after the breakup. She came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed the child wasn't his, he made her leave again. Now, people are saying he's being cruel to the unborn child.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But the question is about moral or emotional wrongness. The author is being accused of being a bad person for not helping the \"innocent child.\" But the child isn't born yet, so how can he be responsible? He wasn't the one who cheated; the ex did. She was the one in the relationship, and she led him on, possibly lying about the paternity. \n\nBut wait, maybe he should have known she was cheating and still agreed to support the child. But he did the test to confirm. He trusted her initially when she was happy about the test, thinking it would confirm he was the father. When it didn't, he felt betrayed again. The mutual friends are pressuring him, but maybe they don't realize that he's not the biological father. \n\nIs it fair for him to be expected to support a child that isn't his, especially after the emotional turmoil and her deceit? He's not obligated to care for someone else's child. The ex is the one who's pregnant and responsible for the child. So, the author isn't in the wrong here because he's not the father. The real issue is her cheating and misleading him. The friends might be missing that key point. \n\nBut some might argue that even if he's not the father, he could still choose to help. But that's a personal choice, not a moral obligation. So, the answer would be B: No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
