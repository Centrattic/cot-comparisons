It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the ex was living with him, and after a rocky relationship where she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially, he broke up with her. She then came to tell him she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The author let her stay under the condition of the test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, he's feeling guilty because others are telling him he's a bad person for not helping. He's confused about whether he's wrong here. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and emotional aspects. Legally, in many places, you're not obligated to support a child that's not yours unless ordered by a court. The author agreed to help under the assumption the child was his, so once the test came back negative, he's not legally responsible. However, some might argue about moral responsibility, especially if the mother is struggling.\n\nEthically, the author might feel pressured by social norms to help, but he's also dealing with personal betrayal. He was already emotionally drained, and the cheating adds to the complexity. The ex's actions could be seen as manipulative if she knew he was paying for the paternity test but still tried to get him to take responsibility.\n\nEmotionally, the author is in a tough spot. After a breakup and discovering cheating, the betrayal is significant. He might be justified in wanting to distance himself. However, if the ex is in a harmful environment (like her parents smoking), there's a concern for the child's well-being. But the author isn't the legal parent, so others might argue it's not his responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: was there any deceit? If the ex knew the child wasn't his and didn't disclose it before convincing him to let her stay, that's a different scenario. But the author had agreed to the test beforehand, so the ex wasn't hiding the test result. The responsibility here is tied to the test outcome.\n\nIn summary, legally and based on the agreed-upon condition (paternity test), the author isn't in the wrong. The ex's actions might have been self-serving, but the author followed through with his decision based on the test result. The guilt others feel might stem from societal expectations, but the author isn't legally or ethically obligated to support a child he's not the father of. So, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
