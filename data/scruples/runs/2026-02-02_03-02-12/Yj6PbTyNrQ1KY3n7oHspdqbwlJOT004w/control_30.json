It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after a paternity test showed the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The couple was together for two years, then the girlfriend lost her job and the author suspected her of cheating. They broke up, but when she came back pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test revealed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now others are saying he's being selfish, but he's conflicted.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a man is not automatically the legal father unless a paternity test confirms it. So the author isn't legally obligated to support the child. Ethically, some might argue that even if it's not his child, he might still have a moral responsibility, especially if he was in a committed relationship. However, he discovered infidelity, which is a major betrayal. \n\nThe user is asking if he's wrong for not taking care of the child. The author is in a vulnerable emotional state, dealing with betrayal and financial strain. His decision to leave might be seen as self-preservation. However, others might say he should step up because he was part of the woman's life and contributed to the situation. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the child isn't his, he isn't legally responsible. Emotionally, he's been through a lot. The woman's cheating is a factor here. The decision to kick her out after the betrayal and the paternity result might be seen as reasonable. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
