It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found out the child his ex-girlfriend is pregnant with isn't his. He kicked her out of his house. Now he's feeling conflicted and others are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was in a relationship for two years, things got rocky, he suspected cheating, and they broke up. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, the ex and others are saying he's wrong for not taking care of the child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is responsible for the child now that the paternity is proven. Legally, if the DNA test shows he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. \n\nThe author isn't the father, so he might feel he has no responsibility. However, some people might argue that he was involved in the relationship and maybe should step up. But others would say that without being the biological father, he's not responsible. \n\nThe ex was cheating, which adds another layer. The author might feel betrayed, and after the breakup, he took her in temporarily. But once the paternity was clear, he had a right to not want to be involved. \n\nThe argument that he's being a bad person by not helping the child: the author isn't the father, so it's not his responsibility. However, if he had led her to believe he was the father, maybe he'd be in the wrong. But from the narrative, he wanted a test, and she agreed. The test cleared him, so he's not the father. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because he's not the father and thus not responsible. But there could be arguments about emotional support or being a good person regardless. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether he's being a good person. \n\nAlso, the ex is now with her parents, and the author isn't refusing help to her but just the child. The mutual friends might think he should help, but he's not obligated. \n\nSo I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because he's not the father, and he had the right to not want to be involved after the paternity test.\n"
