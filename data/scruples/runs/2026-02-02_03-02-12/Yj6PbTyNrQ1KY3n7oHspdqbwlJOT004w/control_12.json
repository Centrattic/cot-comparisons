It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a breakup due to her losing her job, suspected cheating, then she comes back pregnant. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test shows it's not his, so he kicks her out. Now, people are calling him a bad person for not helping the child, but he's conflicted.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are legality, morality, and emotional context. Legally, in many places, the man can disclaim paternity if the test is negative. Once he knows it's not his, he's not legally obligated to support the child. That's a key point. \n\nMorally, it's trickier. Even if the child isn't his, some might argue that he has a moral responsibility because he thought he was the father. But once the test confirms it's not his, maybe the obligation ends. However, there's also the aspect of her cheating. If she had an affair, that's her responsibility, but the child is innocent. \n\nHe had a prior agreement to do the test, so he followed through. The ex was deceptive, which adds to his betrayal. He's in a vulnerable emotional state, dealing with the breakup and the betrayal. The friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but he's trying to protect himself from further emotional and financial strain. \n\nThe key here is the paternity test. Since he wasn't the father, he's not legally responsible. Morally, some might argue he should help, but others might see it as unfair to him. The fact that she cheated and lied complicates things. He's not at fault for acting on the information he had. The decision to let her stay was conditional, so he followed through on his terms. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had a valid reason based on the paternity test results and followed through on the agreement. The moral obligation isn't there once paternity is disproven. Plus, he's protecting himself after betrayal.\n"
