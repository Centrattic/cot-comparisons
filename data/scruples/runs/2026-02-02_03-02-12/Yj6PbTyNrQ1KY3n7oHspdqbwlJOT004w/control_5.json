It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question, the author, had a complicated situation with his ex-girlfriend. They were together for two years, but things got rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, and after the breakup, she moved in with her parents. Then she came back pregnant, thinking it was his child. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed it wasn't his, he kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to provide support. However, morally, is there an expectation to help? The ex-cheated, which adds emotional betrayal. The author is dealing with emotional stress and feels it's unfair to take responsibility for a child that isn't his. The ex is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, but the author is being criticized for not taking her in.\n\nBut wait, the child is not his, so he's not legally responsible. The main issue here is whether he's morally wrong for not supporting someone else's child. Some might argue that once he was led to believe it was his, maybe he has a responsibility. However, the paternity test cleared him, so he's not the biological father. The ex's choice to have the child not his might affect his decision.\n\nAlso, the author is in a vulnerable emotional state. He's been through a breakup, suspected cheating, and the betrayal of not being the father. The friends are pressuring him to take her back, but he's conflicted. The question is if he's in the wrong for prioritizing his own emotional well-being over helping her.\n\nOn one hand, he's under no obligation to support a child that isn't his. On the other hand, the situation is complex because he initially thought he was the father. However, once the test proved otherwise, his responsibility might be seen as lifted. The fact that she cheated adds another layer of betrayal, which could affect his willingness to help.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the child isn't at fault, but the author isn't the parent. The ex is the one who needs to take responsibility. The author might be right to prioritize his own mental health, especially after the stress he's been through. However, some might say he should help because of their past relationship and the initial assumption of parenthood.\n\nBut legally and morally, he's not required to support someone else's child. The key here is that the child isn't his. So, the answer would likely be B, he's not in the wrong because he isn't responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after the betrayal and the emotional toll.\n"
