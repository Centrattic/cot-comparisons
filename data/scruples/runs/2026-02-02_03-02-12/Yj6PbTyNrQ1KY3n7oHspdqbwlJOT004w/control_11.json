It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author was in a 2-year relationship. They had some issues, like financial strain when the girlfriend lost her job and stopped looking for work. He suspected she was cheating, so he broke up with her. She then came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay but with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the baby isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. But ethically, some might argue he still has a responsibility to help, even if the child isn't his. On the other hand, the author went through emotional turmoil, betrayal, and financial stress. He might feel justified in not wanting to support a child that isn't his, especially after the cheating was confirmed.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She cheated, didn't look for work, and now the author feels used. However, the child is innocent. Some people might think he should still help, even if it's not his child, out of compassion. Others might see his actions as self-preservation after being betrayed.\n\nThe author's decision to leave is a personal choice. But the societal expectation might be that he should help regardless. However, he's not legally responsible. The mutual friends are criticizing him, which adds social pressure. The author is conflicted, feeling both justified and guilty.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. Not everyone would agree. If the author genuinely believed the child isn't his and has no legal obligation, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if people see him as abandoning someone in need, even indirectly, he might be considered wrong. The key factors are the paternity test result and his emotional state. Since the child isn't his, his decision might be seen as legally and personally valid, but some might still criticize him for not offering support out of kindness.\n"
