It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after discovering the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man and his ex were together for two years. Their relationship was rocky because she lost her job and became a financial burden. He suspected her of cheating, broke up, and she left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. The test proved the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, others are criticizing him for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here are the paternity test result and the man's decision to no longer support the child. The question is about his responsibility towards a child that isn't his. Legally, if the man isn't the father, he has no obligation to provide support. However, there's a moral argument here. He allowed her to stay in his home under the assumption he was the father. Once the test showed otherwise, he felt betrayed and decided to cut ties. But the ex and others are saying he should still help.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A or B. From a legal standpoint, he's not obligated. But morally, there's a gray area. He might have financial means, and the child could need help. However, the ex's behavior\u2014cheating, losing job, being a financial burden\u2014might influence perceptions. Also, the man's emotional state after the betrayal could be a factor. \n\nBut the main issue is whether he's responsible for a child that isn't his. If he's not the father, then yes, he can choose not to help. However, if he had already committed to supporting her during the pregnancy under the belief he was the father, maybe there's an ethical obligation. But once the test proves he isn't, maybe that obligation is lifted. \n\nOthers might argue that he should step up regardless, but he's not the legal father. The ex's actions might also be questionable\u2014cheating, not working, relying on him financially. So, the man's decision could be seen as justified if he's not the father. Therefore, the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
