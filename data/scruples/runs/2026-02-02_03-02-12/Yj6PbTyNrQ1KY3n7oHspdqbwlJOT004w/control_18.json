It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the key facts: The ex and author were together for two years, with a rocky end where she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading him to break up and ask her to leave. He suspected her of cheating, which was later confirmed. She came back when pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he told her to leave again. Now, mutual friends and her friends are criticizing him for not supporting the child, even though he doesn't feel responsible since he's not the father.\n\nSo, the main issues here are paternity, financial responsibility, and emotional impact. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically. \n\nThe author provided a home to let her avoid her parents' smoking, which he saw as a healthier environment. But since the child isn't his, does that obligation still stand? The friends argue he should help regardless, but he's not the biological father. He also went through a breakup and confirmed cheating, which likely caused emotional strain. \n\nHowever, maybe the author is being too harsh. Even if the child isn't his, the woman is still someone he was in a relationship with, and she's in a vulnerable state. But the user's question hinges on whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the father, maybe he's not responsible, but perhaps he's still expected to support her. \n\nI need to consider societal norms and personal responsibility. Some might say that once you're in a relationship and she's pregnant, you should help regardless of paternity to avoid abandoning her. Others might argue he has no duty to a child that isn't his, especially after being cheated on and the breakup. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not the father, so he doesn't want to be responsible. The friends are saying he should take care of them anyway, perhaps implying a sense of moral responsibility beyond biology. But the woman's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the breakup. \n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, the author isn't the biological father. The child's well-being is more directly tied to the mother and the actual father. However, the author's decision might affect the mother's living situation, which in turn affects the child. But he's not the father, so legally and morally, is he responsible?\n\nI think the answer depends on whether you prioritize biological ties or the previous relationship. Since the test cleared him as the father, legally he's not obligated. Morally, if he had a child with her, it would be different, but here he's not the father. However, some might still feel he's responsible for her well-being. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but he's not the father, and he's already ended the relationship, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the initial breakup was because she was living for free and not supporting herself. Now she's back, but since the child isn't his, perhaps he's justified in not wanting to support her again. On the other hand, if she's in a vulnerable situation, maybe he should help regardless. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The act of kicking her out after the paternity test shows she's not his child, so maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No. But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother angle: The author let her stay to avoid the child (hers) being exposed to smoke. If he kicks her out, the child is now with her parents who smoke. But since he's not the father, maybe he's within his rights to prioritize his own situation. The emotional ringer part shows he's been through a lot. \n\nThe main point is that he's not the biological father. So, he's not legally bound, and if he's not willing to take responsibility, maybe he's not in the wrong. But societal expectations might pressure him to help. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about societal expectations. Since the child isn't his, the answer is B.\n"
