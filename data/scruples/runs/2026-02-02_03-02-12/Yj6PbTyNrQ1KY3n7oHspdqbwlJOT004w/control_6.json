It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex was living with him, and he suspected she was cheating. He broke up with her, she left, then came back saying she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay, pending a paternity test. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he kicked her out. Now friends are telling him he's wrong for not helping her and the baby.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the paternity test result, the emotional state of the author, and the external pressure from friends. Legally, if he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. But ethically? It's more complicated. He supported her financially before, but after the betrayal of cheating and the paternity result, he might feel justified in removing himself. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the unborn child's well-being. Even if he's not the father, the child might need support. But does the author have a responsibility here? If the mother is struggling, maybe the author could argue he's not responsible. On the other hand, if he was the primary caregiver before, maybe there's a moral obligation. But since the mother is with her parents and a friend, perhaps she's getting the necessary support.\n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. He feels betrayed, which is understandable. The friends' messages are making him question his decision. But the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Ethically, it's tricky. He might not be in the wrong if he's not the father, but some might argue he should help if the mother is struggling. However, given the circumstances of the cheating and the paternity test, his decision could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nSo, considering all angles\u2014legal and emotional\u2014it's more about his right to prioritize his own well-being after the betrayal. The answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
