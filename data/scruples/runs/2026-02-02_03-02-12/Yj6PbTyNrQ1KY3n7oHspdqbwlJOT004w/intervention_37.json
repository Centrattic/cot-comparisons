It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after a paternity test revealed the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the context: They were in a two-year relationship. The relationship became rocky when she lost her job and he had to support her. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed it's not his, he asked her to leave.\n\nHe's being criticized by friends and her friends for not helping the \"innocent child.\" He's struggling with guilt and emotions.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The key points here are the paternity test result and the prior suspicions of cheating. If she cheated, then the child isn't his by any means. Legally and morally, he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his. Also, the situation was already tense with financial strain from her not working and his suspicion of infidelity. The paternity test confirmed his fears, leading to a sudden change in his responsibility.\n\nBut wait, there's also the aspect of the child's well-being. Even if he doesn't have to care for the child, there's a social expectation to step up. However, he's in a vulnerable emotional state, and the situation was already causing him stress. The friends' arguments about him being a bad person might be clouding his judgment, but legally and ethically, he's not bound to help. \n\nAnother angle: Did he have any obligation to support her? Since he's not the biological father, he's not legally responsible. However, some might argue there's a moral obligation if he believed the child was his and then found out otherwise. But since he had the test done, he's acting on the truth now. \n\nHe also mentions her parents' house is unhealthy (smoking), so his initial decision to let her stay was to protect the child. But now, since he's not the father, he's prioritizing his own emotional state, which is valid. The child's safety is still a concern, so maybe he's wrong to leave her in a potentially harmful environment. But she's staying with a friend, so perhaps that's a safer alternative.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might be seen as harsh, legally and based on the information, he's not in the wrong. However, there's a moral debate. The answer hinges on whether one views the situation through a legal/moral lens versus a compassionate one. The question asks if he's in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the facts given, the answer is B.\n"
