It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship that ended because the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading the author to break up. She moved in with her parents. Then she comes back pregnant, claims he's the father, and they agree to a paternity test. After the test shows he's not the father, he kicks her out. Now, people are criticizing him for not helping.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, since he's not the biological father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, it's more complicated. He initially took her in to protect the child from her parents' smoking, but once he found out it's not his child, he withdrew support. \n\nThe author mentions emotional distress from the breakup and possible cheating, which was confirmed later. He's struggling with his feelings about the situation. The ex and friends are pressuring him to help, but he's trying to process his emotions.\n\nKey points: The author isn't the biological father, he provided a temporary home under the assumption he was the father, and upon discovering he wasn't, he ended the arrangement. The woman is still pregnant, but since the child isn't his, he isn't responsible for it. However, there's an argument about whether he should still help because he knew her situation and maybe felt a moral responsibility even if he wasn't the father. But since the test cleared that he's not the father, his responsibility is not clear. \n\nThe woman might have known the child wasn't his and lied to him, which would be a significant betrayal. If she knew and used that to get back into his home, that's deception. However, the author's decision to kick her out after the test might be justified if he believes she cheated and lied. \n\nOn the other hand, if she didn't know until later, maybe she was trying to be honest. But since the author suspected cheating and it was later confirmed, there's a possibility of her lying about the paternity. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't legally bound to support the child. Ethically, some might say he should still help because he's in a position to do so, but others would argue that he's not responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after being deceived. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is legally or morally obligated. Since he's not the father, and assuming the woman lied about the paternity, he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
