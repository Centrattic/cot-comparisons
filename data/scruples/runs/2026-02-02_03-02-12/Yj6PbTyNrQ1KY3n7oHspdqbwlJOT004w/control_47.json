It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the right thing by kicking his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years but broke up because she was unemployed and he suspected her of cheating. She came back saying she was pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, the author isn't the father, so he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. But the question is about moral or ethical wrong. The ex is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking. Friends are saying he's being a bad person for not helping. He's feeling conflicted about it.\n\nThe author's reasons for asking her to leave were based on the paternity test result and his emotional state. He was already stressed from the breakup, suspected cheating, and the pregnancy was part of the previous relationship. His main concern now is not having to support a child that's not his, especially given the betrayal he felt.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is pregnant and in a vulnerable position. She might need support, and the author is in a position where he can help. But he also has the right to not be financially responsible for someone else's child, especially after confirming it's not his.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. Some might argue that once he agreed to let her stay and help during the pregnancy, he has a responsibility regardless of the paternity test. Others might say that since the child isn't his, he's under no obligation to continue supporting them. However, there's also the aspect of treating someone kindly; even if he's not the father, she's in a difficult situation. But he did agree to the paternity test, and once the result came back, his willingness to help changed. \n\nThe author is also dealing with emotional trauma from the cheating and the breakup, which might affect his judgment. But does that excuse him from helping? Maybe not. People in vulnerable situations often need support, but it's not his responsibility if he's not the father. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the child isn't his, and he's within his rights to not provide support. However, from a compassionate standpoint, there might be arguments for helping regardless. But legally and ethically, since the child isn't his, he's not obligated. The answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but there's nuance. But according to the options given, A is if he's wrong, B if not. Given that the paternity test cleared him, I think B is the answer here.\n"
