It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author kicked their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child wasn't theirs. They had a two-year relationship that ended because the girlfriend lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and the author suspected cheating. After the breakup, the girlfriend came back saying she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. Once the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they don't want to be responsible for a child they aren't the father of, especially given the history of possible cheating and the financial strain. They also mention the health issues from the girlfriend's parents smoking. On the other hand, people are telling the author they're being cruel by not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, legally, in many places, a man isn't automatically a legal father unless tested and confirmed. The author had the right to get tested, and once the test came back negative, he's not obligated to support someone else's child. Emotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal and stress, which might explain their decision. However, the social aspect is tricky. Even though the author isn't the father, some might argue that he's still in a position where he could help the mother, but others would say he's not responsible. \n\nThe key points here are legal rights versus moral obligations. Legally, the author isn't the father, so he's not bound by law to support the child. Morally, some might see it as compassionate to help, but others might agree that the author is under no obligation, especially given the circumstances like cheating and financial issues. The author also had to consider his own financial stability, as supporting another person's child could add more stress. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like not working and possibly cheating, are part of the backstory that might justify the author's decision. The paternity test was agreed upon, so the author acted on the results. The friends' messages criticizing him are based on moral judgment, but the author's decision is rooted in personal circumstances and legal clarity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is emotionally complex, the author made a decision based on the test results and his own well-being, which might not make him wrong. However, there's a moral argument for helping, but legally and ethically, the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
