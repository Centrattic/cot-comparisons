It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the author is a guy who had a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. They broke up because she started losing her job and wasn't looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. She moved in with her parents, but when she came back pregnant, he let her stay with him again, but with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author let her stay with him under the condition of a paternity test. He was willing to support her and the child if he was the father. When the test showed he wasn't, he felt betrayed and decided to kick her out. But now others are pressuring him to take her back and care for the child.\n\nLegally, if he isn't the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. However, there's a moral aspect here. Did he make a promise or commitment that would require him to help even if he isn't the father? The situation is complicated because he was supportive before knowing the truth. Now that he knows it's not his child, he's emotionally raw and doesn't want to deal with it.\n\nThe ex cheated on him, which adds to his feeling of betrayal. But does that justify not helping? The child is innocent, so there's a moral argument that he should help the mother, regardless of the father's identity. But he's not the father, so maybe he's not responsible. However, if he had already decided to support her during the pregnancy, changing his mind now could be seen as unfair, especially if the mother is struggling and others are involved.\n\nOn the other hand, he's under a lot of emotional stress. The cheaters and the whole situation might have made him feel used. Legally, he's not the father, so he can't be forced to help. But morally, if he's the one who allowed her to stay and then backed out, some might see that as abandoning her at a vulnerable time.\n\nIt's a tough call. The key points are his prior agreement to support her if he was the father, the fact that he's not, and the pressure from others. The answer might depend on whether his initial willingness to support her was a binding commitment. If he felt manipulated into staying with her, that's different. But if he genuinely wanted to help, then leaving her now could be seen as wrong. However, since he's not the father, he's not legally obligated. So maybe he's not in the wrong legally, but morally there's a question.\n"
