It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years. Their relationship was strained when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support them financially. He suspected her of cheating, which led to a breakup, and she went to her parents. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay but wanted a paternity test. After the test came back negative, he kicked her out. Now, he's feeling conflicted because friends are telling him he's being a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's action was justified. Let me consider the key points. \n\nThe author was already dealing with a troubled relationship, financial strain, and suspicion of infidelity. When he agreed to let her stay, it was under the condition of a paternity test. The test results showed the child wasn't his, which led to his decision to end their living arrangement. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, the author isn't obligated to support a child that isn't his. But from an ethical or moral standpoint, some might argue that once he knew he was a potential father, he had a responsibility, even if it was later proven otherwise. However, the initial agreement included the paternity test, so he was clear about wanting confirmation. \n\nThe ex girlfriend cheated, which adds another layer. The author might feel betrayed, especially since the child isn't his. His decision to leave might stem from both the infidelity and the financial burden. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that by accepting her back and agreeing to the test, there was an implicit agreement to support the child if it was his. But once proven otherwise, he's not responsible. However, the child's well-being is a concern. If the ex's parents are an unhealthy environment, the author might feel pressure to help despite not being the father. \n\nBut the author is struggling emotionally. He's been through a lot, and his decision might be a result of his own emotional state. Friends are judging him, but he's trying to reconcile his feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Legally, he's not at fault. Ethically, some may argue he's abandoning a child in need, but others might see it as a boundary based on prior circumstances. The key is that he followed through with the agreed-upon test and made a decision based on the results. The fact that he's conflicted shows he's considering the child's welfare, but he feels unable to take on the responsibility due to personal reasons. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the agreement to support the child was binding before the test. Since the author made the condition of the test, once that was done, he wasn't obligated. However, the emotional aspect is complex. But legally and in terms of the original agreement, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B, No.\n"
