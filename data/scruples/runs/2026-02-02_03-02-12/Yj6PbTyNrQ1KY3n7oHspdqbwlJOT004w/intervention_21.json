It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the background: They were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. The ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading the author to break up. She moved in with her parents, but then came back saying she was pregnant. The author let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test came back negative, he kicked her out.\n\nSo the main points here are responsibility, emotional state, and legal aspects. Legally, if the test proves he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014suspected cheating, breakup, then betrayal when she cheated. The ex is now facing judgment from friends for not helping, but the author might be justifiably feeling used or betrayed.\n\nBut wait, did he know about the cheating before finding out the child wasn't his? The story says he suspected she was cheating and broke up with her. Then after the breakup, she came back with the pregnancy. The paternity test confirmed it's not his. So he's been through emotional turmoil, and the friends are pressuring him to take her back. \n\nIs it fair to kick her out? Well, he's not the father, so he's not legally responsible. But maybe there's a moral angle here. However, the author made it clear he wanted the test done beforehand. She agreed willingly. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he felt justified in his decision. \n\nFriends are calling him a bad person, but from a legal standpoint, he's not obligated. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and stress. The user says the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. \n\nAnother angle: Did he have the right to let her stay under the condition of the test? Yes, he set the terms. Once the test was done and it wasn't his, he followed through. He's not in a relationship anymore, so he's not bound by any legal or moral obligation beyond the test result. The ex is now on her own, which is harsh, but perhaps the author is within his rights to prioritize his own well-being after the betrayal. \n\nSo considering all that, Answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense. The key points are the paternity test result, the prior agreement, and the emotional/ethical boundaries he's setting post-breakup.\n"
