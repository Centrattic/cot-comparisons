It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Ask Me Anything\" post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky, especially after she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading to him financially supporting her. He suspected cheating, which led to a breakup. She then came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was wrong. Let's consider the key points. The woman is pregnant, and the author initially supported her, but upon discovering the child isn't his, he decided to end their living arrangement. The ex cheated, which is a significant betrayal. The author is dealing with emotional turmoil, and others are pressuring him to take care of the child.\n\nLegally, if the author isn't the biological father, he isn't obligated to care for the child. However, if he had previously contributed to the child's care or expenses, there might be some legal implications, but the story says he found out the child isn't his, so that might not apply here. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot: a breakup, suspicion of cheating, financial strain, and now the betrayal of being the non-biological father. His decision to ask her to leave could be seen as a way to protect himself from further emotional and financial exploitation. However, the unborn child is still a human being, and some might argue that the author has a moral responsibility, especially if he was supportive during the pregnancy.\n\nBut here's the twist: the author didn't know the child wasn't his until after the paternity test. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of the test, which she agreed to. Once the test results came back, he's justified in feeling betrayed and not wanting to be involved. It's his home, and he's allowed to set boundaries, especially after a breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that kicking someone out during pregnancy, regardless of the circumstances, is harsh. But the author isn't cutting off the mother entirely; he's allowing her to stay with a friend instead of her parents. Also, he's not refusing to help in the future if needed, just ending the current living arrangement because the trust is broken.\n\nThe key factors are the lack of legal obligation, the prior suspicion of cheating that was confirmed, and the agreed-upon paternity test. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to leave the situation after the betrayal. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
