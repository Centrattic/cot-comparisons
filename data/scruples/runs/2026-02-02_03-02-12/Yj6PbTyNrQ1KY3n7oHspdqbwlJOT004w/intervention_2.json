It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a two-year relationship. It ended because she lost her job, didn't look for work, and he suspected cheating. She moved out. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are calling him a bad person.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the paternity test. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of the test, which she agreed to. When the test results came back negative, he felt betrayed again, especially with the confirmed cheating. He's in emotional turmoil and doesn't want to be responsible for a child that isn't his.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, paternity is established when the biological father is confirmed. Since the test proved he isn't the father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's dealing with the betrayal and the stress of the previous months. His decision to ask her to leave could be seen as self-preservation. However, some might argue that he should still help because the child is vulnerable. But he's not the biological father, so maybe it's not his responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, there's the argument that even if it's not his child, he might still have a moral obligation to support her, especially since he allowed her to stay in his home. But the user's stance is that he's not in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. The mutual friends think he should take her back, but he's feeling emotionally raw. \n\nI think the main factor here is consent and agreement. Since the paternity test was agreed upon and the result showed he's not the father, he's within his rights to not take responsibility. The emotional aspect is valid, but legally and morally, without being the biological father, the obligation isn't there. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
