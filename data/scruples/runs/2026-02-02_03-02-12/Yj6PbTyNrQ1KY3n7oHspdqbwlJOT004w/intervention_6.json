It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the guy and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and he had to support her. He suspected she was cheating, so he broke up with her. She came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test shows it's not his, he kicks her out.\n\nNow, the friends are calling him a terrible person for not helping the \"innocent child.\" The author is conflicted, feeling emotionally raw and wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. But ethically? That's more complex. He had a relationship with the mother, but once he found out the child isn't his, he's not the biological father. However, people might argue that he's still emotionally involved or that he should help out regardless.\n\nBut he had already made it clear that the paternity test was a condition. Once the test came back negative, he followed through on his condition. He's under no obligation to take care of someone else's child, especially when he's already been through the emotional turmoil of a breakup and possible cheating. \n\nThe ex cheated, which adds another layer. The author might feel betrayed, which could contribute to his decision to cut ties. Also, the ex was living off him financially before, so maybe he's trying to protect himself from further financial and emotional strain.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he should take responsibility if he was in a committed relationship, even if the child isn't his. But technically, paternity tests exist to clarify such situations. If he had agreed to support her conditionally based on the test result, then his actions are justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. He followed through on his condition, and there's no legal obligation. Emotionally, it's tough, but he's not the biological father, and he's dealing with betrayal from her. It's his right to prioritize his own mental health after the test results.\n"
