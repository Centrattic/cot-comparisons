It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (the author) had a girlfriend who got pregnant, but he found out the child isn't his. He kicked her out of his house. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The couple was together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. The girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so the author had to support them both financially. Then they broke up, she went to her parents, but came back because her mom smokes. The author agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed he's not the father, he asked her to leave again.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014suspected cheating, the breakup, then the paternity news. His friends say he should help, but he's struggling with the decision.\n\nOn one hand, he's not responsible for the child's care if it's not his. He's already been financially supporting her, which might have been a mistake if she wasn't working. On the other hand, some might argue he should help because she's vulnerable, but he's also dealing with personal trauma. The fact that she cheated is a big betrayal, which adds to his emotional state.\n\nBut wait, did he have any other options? Maybe he could have offered temporary help without letting her stay. However, he made a choice based on the information he had. The paternity test cleared up the situation, and he's not obligated to take care of someone else's child. The pressure from friends might not mean he's wrong. Each person has their own limits, especially in a situation where they were cheated on and financially strained.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think he's not in the wrong. He made a decision based on his circumstances and the test results. People may judge, but he's not responsible for the child if it's not his. His emotional state is valid, and he's allowed to set boundaries after betrayal.\n"
