It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex and author were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected cheating and broke up with her, leading her to live with her parents. She later came back, pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are the paternity test and the circumstances surrounding their breakup. The author suspected cheating, which was later confirmed when the child isn't his. The ex was living with her parents who smoked, so he allowed her to stay for the child's health. But after the paternity test, he no longer wants to support her. \n\nMoral and legal considerations: Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, possible betrayal, and now the stress of supporting another child. His friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but he's struggling with his emotions. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The main argument against him is that the child is innocent and needs help. However, he wasn't the biological father and had already set conditions for staying. He might feel betrayed, especially since cheating was confirmed. \n\nBut does that make it right to kick her out? If he knew the child wasn't his, perhaps he should have considered other options for her, like helping her find housing or support, rather than abruptly asking her to leave. However, the text mentions that she's staying with a friend now, avoiding her parents' smoking. He might not have the resources or emotional capacity to support her, especially given the recent breakup and betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's abandoning a vulnerable person (pregnant woman) and the unborn child. But legally, there's no obligation unless he's the biological father or has legally committed to support her. Emotionally, he's dealing with a lot, and his reaction could be justified given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong (B), but there's nuance. However, the paternity test was agreed upon, so his decision isn't arbitrary. He's not obligated to support someone else's child, especially after a breakup where cheating was involved. So the answer is B.\n"
