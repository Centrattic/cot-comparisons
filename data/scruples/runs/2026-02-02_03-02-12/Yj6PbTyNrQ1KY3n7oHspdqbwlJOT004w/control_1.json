It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who kicked his pregnant ex-girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me consider the key points here.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex had a rocky relationship. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was financially supporting them. He suspected she was cheating, broke up, but she came back pregnant. He agreed to let her stay, with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his. He then asked her to leave. Now, people are telling him he's wrong for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. But ethically, it's more complex. He's being criticized for not helping an \"innocent child.\" However, he was already under stress from the breakup, financial support, and the betrayal of cheating. He might feel that he's not responsible for the child now that the paternity is confirmed. \n\nBut wait, even if the child isn't his, the mother is still a person he was involved with. By kicking her out, is he abandoning his partner in a vulnerable time? She's alone, pregnant, and moving back with her parents who have issues. He might be avoiding responsibility, but he's also dealing with emotional trauma. However, the child's well-being is a concern. If the mother is in an unsafe environment, maybe the man should have offered support regardless of paternity. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not the father, so his obligation is less clear. But if she was his girlfriend and he was part of her life, some might argue he has a moral duty to help. However, this is subjective. The man's emotional state is also valid. He's been through a lot and might not be equipped to handle the situation.\n\nThe key factors here are legal obligation, emotional state, and ethical responsibility. Legally, he's not obligated. Emotionally, he's justified in feeling betrayed. Ethically, it's debatable. Some might say he's being selfish by not helping, others might say he's not responsible. The answer probably hinges on personal ethics. However, in terms of the question's options, the user wants a binary answer.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that if you're in a relationship and a child is involved, you have a responsibility regardless of paternity. But the man here had a condition for the test and followed through. Once the test was negative, he decided to end the living arrangement. This could be seen as fair because he wasn't the father and had no legal duty. However, if he knew the mother was in a bad situation, even without legal obligation, some might say he should help. But others would respect his right to prioritize his own well-being.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), because legally and ethically, he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his, especially after confirming paternity. However, it's a complex issue. But since the options are A or B, the most accurate answer based on the given info would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
