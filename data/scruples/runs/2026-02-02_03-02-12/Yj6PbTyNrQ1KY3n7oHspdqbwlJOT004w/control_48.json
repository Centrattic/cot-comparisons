It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because she lost her job, wasn't working, and he suspected cheating. She left to live with her parents.\n2. She came back pregnant, assuming it was his child. He agreed to let her stay but insisted on a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his.\n3. Upon finding out, he kicked her out. Now, others are calling him a bad person for not supporting the unborn child.\n4. He's feeling conflicted, considering taking her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, the man isn't the legal father if the paternity test proves otherwise. So he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. However, ethical considerations might come into play, especially if there's a sense of responsibility felt.\n\nEmotionally, the author went through a breakup, suspected cheating, and then a confirmed betrayal. The paternity test confirmed he's not the father, leading to his decision to end the living arrangement. His feelings of betrayal and emotional exhaustion are valid. But the question is whether his actions are wrong.\n\nArguments for the author being wrong (A): Even though he's not the biological father, he might have a moral obligation to help if he's been involved. Also, the woman is in a vulnerable state, pregnant, and being supported by friends to take care of her. However, the woman did cheat, which complicates things. There's a question of responsibility if he was the one she approached with the pregnancy.\n\nArguments for not being in the wrong (B): Legally, he's not the father. He agreed to help only if the child was his, and after the test, he's not obligated. He's also dealing with his own emotional turmoil and betrayal. The woman's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the initial breakup. The author isn't required to provide support if he's not the father.\n\nI need to weigh the legal, ethical, and emotional factors. The legal stance is clear: no obligation. Ethically, it's more subjective. If the author chose to help despite not being the father, that's commendable, but he's not morally required to. His decision to leave after the test isn't inherently wrong. However, some might argue he has a moral duty if he's been involved. But since the relationship was already broken and the cheating confirmed, maybe not. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong), but I should consider if there's any ethical responsibility beyond legal. Since the woman is with friends now, perhaps the author isn't obligated. So final answer B.\n"
