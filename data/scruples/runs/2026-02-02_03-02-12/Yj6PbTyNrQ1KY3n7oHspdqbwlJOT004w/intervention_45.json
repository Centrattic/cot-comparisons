It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a two-year relationship. In the last few months, things were rocky because she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, which led to him breaking up with her. She left to live with her parents. Then, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, and he asked her to leave. Now, friends are saying he's a terrible person for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author had a prior arrangement that included a paternity test, which he followed through on. When the test didn't confirm paternity, he ended the arrangement. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the author isn't the biological father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. However, the moral aspect is more ambiguous. The author might feel he's not responsible for another man's child, especially given the betrayal from cheating. On the other hand, the woman is pregnant and in a vulnerable position, and he's being urged by friends to take responsibility.\n\nThe author's reasons for kicking her out include the emotional toll, betrayal, and not being the biological father. He's also concerned about the child's environment, but after the test, that concern shifts to his own emotional state and not wanting to be in a situation where he's responsible for someone else's child. \n\nThe ex's parents smoke, so he wanted to protect the child, but now that she's with a friend, maybe the immediate danger is gone. However, the emotional and financial support for her and the child is another angle. \n\nBut legally, he's not the father, so he doesn't have a duty. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might argue that he should help because she's in a vulnerable situation, even if not by his choice. Others might say he's within his rights to not take responsibility for a child that's not his, especially after betrayal. \n\nThe author's friends are pressuring him to help, which adds to his internal conflict. He's torn between societal expectations and his own feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The key factors are consent to the paternity test, the outcome, and the agreement. The author set the terms, and after the test, he followed through. So, legally and in terms of the agreed-upon terms, he's not wrong. Morally, it's debatable. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer B (the author is not in the wrong) seems appropriate. He acted based on the test result and his own emotional state, and there's no legal obligation. However, the moral judgment is subjective, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just morally right or wrong.\n"
