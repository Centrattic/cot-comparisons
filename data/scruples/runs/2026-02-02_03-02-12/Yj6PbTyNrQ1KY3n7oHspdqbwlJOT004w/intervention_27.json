It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated because it involves a pregnancy, a paternity test, and the author's decision to kick out his pregnant ex-partner after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points from the story. The man and his ex had been together for two years. Their relationship was rocky, especially after she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating and eventually broke up with her. She then came back to tell him she's pregnant, and he agreed she could live with him again, with the condition of doing a paternity test. She agreed. After the test comes back negative, he asks her to leave. Now, she and others are saying he's being cruel and should help the child regardless.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. But morally, some might argue he has a responsibility because he was involved with the mother and the situation is complicated. However, the author did agree to let her stay temporarily under the condition of the paternity test. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he felt justified in asking her to leave. \n\nHe also mentions that her parents smoke, which could be harmful to the unborn child. But after the test, he's no longer the father, so maybe his concern shifts. However, others might argue that the child still needs support, and he's being selfish by not helping. \n\nThe author is also dealing with emotional trauma\u2014cheating and the betrayal. He's emotionally raw, which might affect his judgment. But does that excuse his actions? Some might say he's in a vulnerable state and making a snap decision. Others might say he's right to prioritize his own well-being after being misled and betrayed.\n\nThere's also the fact that she cheated on him. If the child isn't his, maybe the cheating is confirmed, adding to his sense of betrayal. However, that doesn't necessarily mean he's right to cut off support for the child. People often feel they have to support a child even if the circumstances are difficult.\n\nAnother angle: by allowing her to stay, he might have created a false sense of security. The test was a condition, so once that's done, it's reasonable to ask her to leave. But maybe he should have considered other options for her and the child instead of just kicking her out. However, he mentions she's staying with a friend, so maybe there are alternatives.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he's not the father, he isn't legally bound to support the child. But morally, some might think he has a duty because of their past relationship. But others might argue that he was deceived and has the right to protect himself emotionally and financially.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are legally defensible. Morally, it's more ambiguous. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just legally or morally, but in the context of the situation, the answer might depend on societal expectations. If society expects people to support children they're involved with, even if not the biological father, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the society values personal autonomy and consent, then he's within his rights.\n\nI think the key points are the paternity test as a condition and the subsequent betrayal. The author acted based on the information he had and the understanding that he wasn't the father. He might not be in the wrong legally, but some might argue he's being heartless. However, given that he wasn't the father and had already ended the relationship, his decision to remove himself from the situation could be seen as justified. So, I'm leaning towards B (No) he's not in the wrong.\n"
