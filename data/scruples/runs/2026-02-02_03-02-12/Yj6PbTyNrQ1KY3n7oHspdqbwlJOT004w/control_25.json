It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex and the author were together for two years. The relationship was rocky, she lost her job, and he felt she was living off him. He suspected she was cheating and broke up. She went to live with her parents. Then she came back, told him she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now, her friends and mutual friends are saying he's wrong for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and responsibility. The author had a condition for the child's care\u2014paternity test. Once the child isn't his, he's no longer committed to that arrangement. But the question is whether he's obligated to care for the child now regardless of the paternity test.\n\nLegally, in many places, a man isn't considered the legal father unless he's married to the mother or has established paternity voluntarily. Since the author had a paternity test to confirm he wasn't the father, he might not have legal responsibility. However, this is a moral question, not just legal. \n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong morally. The author might feel that since he agreed to the arrangement under the assumption it was his child, the responsibility is lifted once that's proven false. But others might argue that he's still responsible for the child's well-being, especially since he allowed the mother to stay in his home. \n\nAlso, the mother's actions: she cheated, which is a betrayal. The author's trust was broken, and he's emotionally affected. However, the child is innocent. Does he have a moral duty to help the child regardless of the mother's actions? Or is it the mother's responsibility now?\n\nThe ex's friends are pressuring him, but does that matter? He might feel guilty, especially if he's being called a bad person. But his reasons are based on the betrayal and the child not being his. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is fair considering he had a condition and the test results changed the situation. Legally, maybe he's not in the wrong, but morally, some might argue he's abandoning the child. But given that the child isn't his, and he wasn't aware initially, and he had a condition in place, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the fact that he agreed to help under the assumption it was his child, then stopped when it wasn't, might make it understandable. \n\nBut another perspective: once he knew the child was present, even if not his, he might have a moral obligation to help, especially if the mother is in a bad environment. However, the author is also dealing with emotional trauma from the relationship. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because even though the child isn't his, he allowed the mother to stay in his home, and once the situation changed, he abandoned them. The child's well-being should be a priority regardless of the paternity. The friends are right in saying he should help the child. So, the author's decision might be seen as unfair to the child.\n"
