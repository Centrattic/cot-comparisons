It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking out their pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. I need to evaluate the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the relationship context: They were together for two years, but the last months were rocky. The girlfriend lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on the author financially. The author suspected cheating and eventually broke up. She went to live with her parents, then came back with the pregnancy announcement. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed he wasn't the father, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main point is whether he was in the wrong. From the author's perspective, he wanted to confirm paternity before committing to the responsibilities. The girlfriend cheated, which adds to the betrayal. He felt emotionally raw after the breakup and the paternity test results. However, others think he's being selfish by not helping the unborn child.\n\nLegally, if the author isn't the biological father, he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally, the situation is complex. The author might feel wronged by the cheating and the deception regarding paternity. The girlfriend's friends are pushing him to take responsibility, but he's not the father.\n\nBut there's a social aspect here. Even if he isn't the father, some might argue that supporting the child out of moral duty is expected. However, the author has his own emotional and financial well-being to consider. The girlfriend's parents have issues (smoking), so maybe he felt he was helping avoid a harmful environment, but since the child isn't his, that responsibility might not fall on him.\n\nThe key points are: the paternity test result, the cheating, and mutual friends judging him. Legally, he's not responsible. Emotionally, he's justified in his decision. The question is about moral responsibility. If he's not the father, why should he take care of the child? But others see it as a duty to protect the child from a harmful environment. However, he's not the father, so maybe it's not his responsibility. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider both sides. The author made a decision based on paternity and the existing issues in the relationship. The girlfriend's friends might be biased. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's not the biological father and the relationship had significant problems. But some might argue he should still help. But legally and logically, he's not the father, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
