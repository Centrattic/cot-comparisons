It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple had been together for two years but things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to move in with her parents. Later, she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: paternity test results confirmed the child isn't his. Legally, he isn't the father. The ex-girlfriend cheated, which adds to the betrayal. He was already under stress from the breakup and financial strain. His decision to ask her to leave was based on the paternity test result. Others are criticizing him for not helping the unborn child, but he's emotionally raw and unsure if he should take responsibility.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate from a legal and ethical standpoint. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to take care of them. Ethically, it's more complex. Even though he's not the father, some might argue he has a moral responsibility if he was led to believe he was a father. However, since the test proved otherwise, his decision to leave might be seen as reasonable. But the emotional aspect and potential societal expectations could play a role. \n\nAlso, the ex-girlfriend's actions\u2014cheating and then seeking support after the breakup\u2014might influence perceptions. The author's financial and emotional state is another factor. He's not in the position to support another person, especially given the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might criticize him for not helping, legally and considering the circumstances, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
