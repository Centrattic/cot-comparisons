It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's ex-girlfriend got pregnant after they broke up. He agreed to let her stay with him temporarily because her mother smokes, and he wanted the unborn child to be in a healthier environment. But there was a caveat: a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are the paternity test and the emotional context. The author had already broken up with her because she was living off his financial support and he suspected cheating. The pregnancy came as a surprise, and initially, he was on board to help, but the paternity test changed everything. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to provide support. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal from the cheating and the stress of the pregnancy. But the main question is whether he's morally in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that once he agreed to help her, he should follow through regardless of paternity. Others might say that the paternity test was a condition he set, and once that was proven false, he's not responsible. Also, the ex cheated, which adds to the betrayal. However, the child is innocent, and cutting off support could affect the child's well-being. \n\nBut the author isn't denying support entirely; he's just asking her to leave his house. He's not refusing to help in other ways, like financially. The mutual friends are pressuring him to take her back, but his emotional state is a factor. \n\nIn terms of fairness, he had a right to want a paternity test, and once it wasn't his child, there's no legal obligation. Morally, it's tricky. He might feel he's justified in ending the living arrangement after the test. On the other hand, some might feel that once he agreed to help because of the mother's smoking, he should continue to support the child. \n\nBut given that he wasn't the father and the relationship was already broken, his decision to ask her to leave after the test might be seen as within his rights. The emotional turmoil and betrayal could also be valid reasons for his decision. So, I think the answer is B; he's not in the wrong.\n"
