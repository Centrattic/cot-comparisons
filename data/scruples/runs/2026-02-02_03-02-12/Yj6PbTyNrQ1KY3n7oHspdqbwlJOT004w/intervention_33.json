It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because he suspected cheating and she was living off him financially. After the breakup, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the child isn't his, he doesn't have any obligation towards it. Paternity tests establish legal responsibility, so once it's confirmed he's not the father, he's under no legal duty to support the child. \n\nEthically, it's trickier. Some might argue that he has a moral duty to support someone he helped conceive with, even if it's not his child, especially if they were in a relationship. Others might say that since he's not the biological father, he's not responsible. Also, the fact that she cheated on him adds another layer. If she was unfaithful, that could be seen as a betrayal, and he might feel justified in cutting ties.\n\nThe author is dealing with emotional turmoil, being cheated on and then having to face the situation again. His decision to leave might be about his own well-being. However, the other side could argue that he's not considering the pregnant woman's needs, especially her health and the child's well-being. She's moving in with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, so maybe he could have offered some support without taking full responsibility.\n\nBut then again, after confirming the child isn't his, he's not legally bound. The friends are pressuring him, but he's not under any obligation to help. His emotional state is a factor here\u2014he's been through a lot. The key points are legality, personal responsibility, and emotional capacity.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not the biological father, he had the test done, and legally/ethically isn't required to support someone else's child, especially after being cheated on. However, there's a gray area where some might argue for moral support, but the author isn't obligated.\n"
