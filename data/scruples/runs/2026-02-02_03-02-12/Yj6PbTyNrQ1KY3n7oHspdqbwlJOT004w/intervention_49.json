It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found out the child his ex is pregnant with isn't his, and he kicked her out of his house. He had previously agreed to let her stay because her mom smokes, and he wanted to protect the child. But once the paternity test came back negative, he changed his mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father has certain responsibilities, but if the man isn't the biological father, he might not be legally obligated. However, if he had assumed parental responsibility before the test, there could be complexities. But since the child isn't born yet, maybe the situation is different. Still, the ex is pregnant, so there's an unborn child involved.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The author had a two-year relationship, which ended because he suspected cheating and she was not working. Now, she's pregnant, but not by him. He's feeling betrayed because she cheated. The mutual friends and others are saying he should help the child. But the author is struggling with his emotions and the idea of taking responsibility for a child that isn't his.\n\nI need to weigh the author's rights versus the potential responsibilities. If he's not the biological father, does he have any obligation to support the child? Legally, probably not, unless he had previously acknowledged paternity or there's some legal agreement. But the ex is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, so maybe there's a real concern for the child's well-being. But if he's not the father, is he responsible for the child's welfare?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's emotionally raw from the relationship ending and the cheating. He's in a vulnerable place and doesn't feel he can handle taking responsibility. On the other hand, the ex is in a situation where her parents are smoking, which is harmful to the unborn child. The author initially wanted to provide a safe environment, but after the paternity test, he changed his mind.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the author should help regardless of paternity because the child's health is at risk. Others might say that since he's not the father, it's not his responsibility. The author's friends are pressuring him to take her back, which adds social pressure. But the author is feeling conflicted and unsure if he was unfair.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The author isn't the biological father. 2) The ex's living situation is unhealthy. 3) The author's emotional state and past relationship issues. 4) Legal obligations versus moral responsibilities.\n\nIn many cases, a man isn't legally responsible for a child he doesn't father unless he has legally acknowledged paternity. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong. However, morally, if the ex is in a harmful environment, is the author obligated to help? That's more subjective. The author might feel that since he's not the father, he's not responsible. But others might argue that he should still help to protect the child. \n\nBut the author had agreed to let her stay to protect the child from smoking, which suggests he did care about the child's well-being. Now that he knows it's not his child, he's conflicted. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not continuing to provide a safe environment. If he's not the father, perhaps it's not his responsibility, but maybe there's still a moral obligation to help someone else's child if they're in danger. However, the author is also dealing with his own emotional trauma and betrayal.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on the difference between legal and moral obligations. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong, but morally, some might argue he has a responsibility. However, the author isn't the father, and it's his home. He can choose to not let someone into his home, especially after the betrayal. So, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit of a grey area. But given the information, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's not the biological father and has the right to set boundaries, especially after the relationship ended and the infidelity was confirmed.\n"
