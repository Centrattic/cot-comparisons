It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author were together for two years. Things got rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and broke up with her, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay, with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed. They did the test, found out it's not his, and he told her to leave.\n\nHe's being criticized for not helping her and the child, especially when she's staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. His friends are saying he's a bad person for not taking her back. He's conflicted because he's been emotionally through a lot, including the betrayal of her cheating. He's wondering if he was unfair to the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1. The pregnancy was not his. 2. He had agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. 3. After finding out it's not his child, he asked her to leave. 4. He's being pressured to take her back and care for the child despite her past actions.\n\nNow, legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. However, morally, there's a debate. Some might say that since he was involved in the pregnancy and made arrangements, he has a responsibility. But others might argue that he's not the father and has the right to distance himself, especially after the betrayal and financial strain mentioned.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She cheated, didn't look for work, and now the child isn't his. He's allowed to prioritize his own well-being. Also, she's staying with a friend, so maybe she has support. But the friends are pressuring him, which could be adding to his stress. He's in a vulnerable emotional state.\n\nIt's important to consider that once the paternity test cleared up the situation, he wasn't bound by that previous agreement anymore. He had the right to change his decision once the facts changed. Also, he had already been through a breakup due to her cheating, which adds to the betrayal aspect. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he had a duty to support the child regardless, but since the child isn't his, that duty isn't legally or morally required. His emotional state and past experiences with her make it understandable that he wants space. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because the child isn't his, and he had the right to withdraw his support once that was confirmed. He's also dealing with the aftermath of her cheating and the stress of their previous relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
