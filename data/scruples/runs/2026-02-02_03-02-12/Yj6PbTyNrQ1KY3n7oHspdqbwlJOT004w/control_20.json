It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, but things got rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading him to break up with her. She then showed up pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. However, if he had previously accepted the pregnancy and agreed to help, there might be some obligations, but once the paternity is proven false, that probably dissolves. \n\nMoral-wise, he's dealing with emotional trauma\u2014cheating, financial burden, and now the child isn't his. He's under a lot of stress. On the other hand, she's pregnant and vulnerable, and he might be cutting her off when she needs support. But she did cheat and was a financial burden before. \n\nHe let her stay to avoid her living in a harmful environment (smoking). Now that he's not the father, he feels no responsibility. The friends are pressuring him to take her back, but that's not his responsibility. The question is whether he's in the wrong by not supporting her now. \n\nHe might be seen as selfish if he refuses help without considering her situation, but he has his own well-being to consider. There's also the possibility of manipulation\u2014maybe she's using the unborn child to get him to stay. However, since the child isn't his, he's not legally bound. \n\nThe key points: he's not the father, he's not required to support the pregnancy, and he's reacting to past betrayals. However, abandoning her entirely might leave her in a worse situation. But he's also within his rights to step back after the truth comes out. It's a tough call between personal responsibility and emotional burden.\n"
