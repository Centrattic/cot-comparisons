It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship. It was rocky, especially when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, which led him to break up and she left to live with her parents.\n\nThen, she came back, pregnant, and he allowed her to stay again with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, friends are criticizing him for being a bad person, but he's conflicted about whether he was right.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. I need to determine if the author's actions are justified.\n\nLet me consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the author isn't the biological father, so he doesn't have legal obligations toward the child. Ethically, it's more complex. He had a relationship where he was supporting her financially and emotionally, but she was using him, possibly cheating, and not contributing. When he found out the child wasn't his, it made sense he felt betrayed and relieved? Or maybe he felt relieved but still conflicted.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, does someone have a moral obligation to support a child that isn't theirs, especially if the mother used them? The mother is responsible for the child. The author had already supported her financially during their relationship, and after the breakup, he wasn't obligated to take her back. The paternity test was a condition he set, so once that was cleared, and the result wasn't in his favor, his decision to end the arrangement seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, the mother's family environment is harmful, so he wanted to protect her from that. But now that the child isn't his, he's not responsible for her anymore. His emotional state is mentioned\u2014going through a lot, feeling raw. It's valid for him to prioritize his own well-being after being betrayed.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he should help regardless because the mother is in a tough spot. But the author isn't the biological father, and the mother has her own family, even if it's not ideal. The author can't be forced to support someone else's child if he doesn't want to, especially given the context of the relationship being problematic.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author did agree to let her stay with the condition of the test. He followed through, and the result changed everything. So, he's not in the wrong for ending the arrangement after the test. The moral obligation isn't there, and his actions are based on the information he had. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
