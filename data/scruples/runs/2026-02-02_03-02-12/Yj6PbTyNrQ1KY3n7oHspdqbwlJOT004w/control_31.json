It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support them financially. He suspected she cheated, broke up with her, but she came back later saying she was pregnant. They agreed to a paternity test, which he allowed her to stay in his house. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave. Now, friends are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo the key points are: the author believed the child wasn't his, had emotional reasons (cheating, financial burden), and the woman and others are now criticizing him. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects. If the child isn't his, then he's not legally or biologically responsible. But he did agree to let her stay, maybe with the intention of being involved as a father. However, the test showed otherwise. His reasons for asking her to leave are betrayal, emotional distress, and maybe not wanting to support a child he's not responsible for. \n\nBut others argue he should help regardless. Some might say it's his responsibility as the presumed father, but if the test proved otherwise, then maybe not. However, if he was willing to support the child initially, but then changed his mind once the paternity wasn't confirmed, that could be seen as unfair. Also, she might be in a vulnerable situation, and he's refusing help when he has the means.\n\nBut then, he's also been through a lot: emotional trauma, cheating, financial strain. It's his home, and he might feel justified in asking her to leave after the betrayal. However, the child is innocent, and cutting them off completely might be seen as harsh.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated. But morally, some might argue that he should still support if he had agreed to help before the test. But others might say he's not responsible if he didn't know and the test cleared him. It's a gray area. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing to support the child once the paternity was proven otherwise. If he's not the father, then he's not at fault for not taking responsibility. However, if he had committed to helping before the test, maybe there's an expectation. But the scenario says he agreed to the test first, so once the results came back negative, his obligation was gone. So in that case, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
