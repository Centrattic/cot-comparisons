It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man and his ex had a two-year relationship. They broke up after he suspected cheating and she lost her job, leading to financial strain. After the breakup, she moved in with her parents but came back claiming pregnancy. He let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test proved the child wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are saying he's being unfair to the unborn child.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, once paternity is disproven, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of a possible fatherhood that was a mistake. However, there's the unborn child's well-being to consider. If he's the biological father, he might have responsibilities, but in this case, he's not. The mother is now left without support, and some argue that even if he's not the father, he might still have a moral duty to help her, especially given their past relationship.\n\nBut the key points here are consent and circumstances. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once that test showed he wasn't the father, his terms were broken. He had the right to withdraw his agreement. Also, he had already ended the relationship before the pregnancy was known. The mutual friends' opinions might be biased, as they might not see the full context of his previous suspicions and the financial strain.\n\nOn the other hand, the unborn child's health is a concern. If her parents smoke, it's in the child's best interest to avoid that environment. But moving in with friends might be a temporary solution. However, he's not the father, so his responsibility is not legal. The emotional aspect is tricky. He might feel obligated due to past circumstances, but he's not legally or biologically responsible now.\n\nAnother angle: the woman might have known from the start the child wasn't his, which could imply deception. If that's the case, his decision to leave is justified. But if she believed the child was his, then he might be cutting her off at a critical time. However, the scenario doesn't mention her lying about the paternity; it just says the test proved otherwise. So maybe he had no reason to suspect that.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might say he's being selfish by not helping, while others say he's within his rights. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, he's dealing with a lot, but the child's well-being is a separate issue. The answer hinges on whether one believes he has a moral duty beyond legal obligations. If the answer is based on legal and the given facts, then B (he's not in the wrong) makes sense. If based on moral obligation, maybe A. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, and since he was not the father and had the right to withdraw his offer, the answer is likely B.\n"
