It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years. Their relationship was rocky in the last few months, with her losing a job and him providing financial support. He suspected her of cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant and he let her stay again, with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nThe main issues here are legal, ethical, and emotional. Legally, if the author is not the biological father, he isn't obligated to support the child. But there might be legal implications if he's been acting as the father, like financial responsibility or custody. However, the key point here is that he found out the child isn't his after allowing her to stay, so the legal obligation might not be there. \n\nEthically, this is more complex. Even if he's not the father, some people might argue that he has a moral responsibility, especially if he believed the child was his and had been supporting the pregnancy. However, the article says he suspected cheating and had broken up with her before the pregnancy was revealed. So maybe he's not in a position to claim responsibility if there's infidelity involved.\n\nEmotionally, the author is struggling. He feels conflicted between others' opinions and his own feelings of betrayal. The ex cheated on him, which adds to his resentment. He's also dealing with the emotional toll of the situation, which might make it harder for him to consider taking the child in.\n\nThe ex's friends and family are pressuring him to help, but if the child isn't his and he's not legally bound, he might have the right to say no. However, societal expectations might make him look like the bad guy even if he's not legally at fault. \n\nAnother angle is his initial decision to let her stay. He did so to avoid the child being around his ex's parents' smoking. Now that he knows he's not the father, he's justified in wanting her to leave, especially given the prior issues. But some might argue that once he allowed her to stay, he has a responsibility to her, regardless of the child's paternity.\n\nThe key factors here are the paternity test results and the circumstances leading up to the decision. If he's not the father and there's no legal obligation, then his decision might be justified. However, if there's any assumption of paternity or he's been acting as the father, that could complicate things. The fact that he suspected cheating and had already broken up might lessen his moral obligation.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the paternity test results and the fact that he's not the biological father, he might not be in the wrong. However, the situation is sensitive, and depending on cultural or personal beliefs, others might judge him harshly. Legally, he likely isn't in the wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. The answer would likely be B (No), as he's not the father and had valid reasons based on the test and previous issues.\n"
