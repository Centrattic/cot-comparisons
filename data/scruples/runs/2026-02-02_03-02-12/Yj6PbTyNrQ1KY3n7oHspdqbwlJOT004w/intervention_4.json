It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after discovering the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but the relationship got rocky when the girlfriend lost her job and stopped looking for work. The man suspected cheating and eventually broke up with her, leading her to move in with her parents. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test proved the child isn't his, so he told her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Legally, if the man isn't the biological father, he's not obligated to support the child. However, there's also the emotional and social aspect. The user's friends are criticizing him for not helping, especially since the unborn child is involved. The man feels betrayed because she cheated, which might be a contributing factor to his decision.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if she cheated, the man isn't responsible for someone else's child. He's already been through a lot\u2014financial strain, emotional stress, and the betrayal. The paternity test showed he's not the father, so he's not legally bound to support the child. He might feel a moral obligation, but that's different. \n\nHowever, there's the argument about the child's well-being. The mother is staying with a friend to avoid secondhand smoke, so maybe she's trying to provide a better environment. But the man's home was offered as a safer place, and now he's refusing. Does he have a responsibility to help regardless of the paternity? Some might say he should, as he initially supported her when she was pregnant. Others might argue that once the paternity is known, his obligation ends. \n\nAlso, when he let her stay initially, he was under the assumption that the child was his. Now that he knows it's not, he might feel deceived. The cheating was confirmed, which adds to his betrayal. So, his emotional response is understandable. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Morally, it's more complex. If he's not the father, he's not legally responsible. But others might argue that even if she cheated, he chose to support her once. However, he's not obligated to do so if the child isn't his. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the man isn't in the wrong because he's not the father and isn't legally required to support the child. His decision to leave the house was based on the paternity test results and his own emotional well-being after the betrayal. The friends' criticism might not take into account the man's right to not support someone else's child. Therefore, the answer would be B: No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
