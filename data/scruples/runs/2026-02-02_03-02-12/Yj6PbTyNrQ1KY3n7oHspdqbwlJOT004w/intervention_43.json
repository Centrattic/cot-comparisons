It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a rocky end because she lost her job and stopped working, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nHe's being criticized by mutual friends and her friends for being a terrible person. He's feeling emotional and conflicted. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his. Ethically, it's more complex. He provided support during the pregnancy, but upon learning the child isn't his, he's not legally responsible. However, some might argue he's being heartless by not helping her and the baby despite the betrayal. Others might say he's right to protect himself after being lied to and financially burdened.\n\nHe also mentioned the emotional toll. The cheating was confirmed, which adds to the betrayal. The friend's arguments about helping the child are valid in terms of moral responsibility, but he's not the biological father. The woman's parents smoke, so he initially took her in for the child's health, but once the paternity was known, maybe he's justified in not continuing.\n\nBalancing his rights and responsibilities versus the child's needs. If the child isn't his, he has no legal duty. Morally, maybe some would say he should help, but others would side with his right to not be exploited. The fact that she cheated and lied is a significant factor. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not legally responsible and was deceived. However, the ethical stance can vary, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the answer is based on common perspectives, likely B is the correct choice.\n"
