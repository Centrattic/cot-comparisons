It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves him kicking his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and ex were together for two years, had a rocky relationship, she lost her job and wasn't looking for work. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she moved to her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay but insisted on a paternity test. The test revealed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now others are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong by not supporting the child after the paternity test. Let's break it down.\n\nLegally, the author isn't the father, so he has no legal obligation to support the child. That's a strong point. Emotionally, he felt betrayed, especially since the ex cheated. The user mentions he suspected cheating before, and the paternity test confirmed his fears. That adds to his emotional state.\n\nHowever, the ex is now pregnant with a child that's not his, and he's choosing not to help. Some might argue that once he's involved emotionally (by letting her stay, agreeing to a test), he has a moral responsibility. But others might say since it's not his child, he's not responsible and has the right to focus on his own well-being after the betrayal.\n\nThe ex is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, which the author previously considered a health risk. Now that she's moving back, maybe he's concerned about her and the child's environment. But does that make him in the wrong? He's making a choice to protect himself after a painful breakup and betrayal.\n\nThe author's emotional state is important. He's been through a lot, and the community is pressuring him to take responsibility. But he's not the biological father, which removes legal obligations. However, the moral aspect is subjective. If he had accepted the responsibility knowing the child isn't his, that's different. But he did a paternity test to confirm, which shows he wanted to ensure it was his. Once it wasn't, he decided to step back.\n\nThe key here is that the author isn't legally bound to support the child. His decision to leave the ex with her parents, despite the smoking, might be seen as harsh, but he's not the father. The ex might need more support, but the author is prioritizing his own mental health after betrayal. So, is he in the wrong? Legally no, morally it's debatable. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since he's not the father and didn't agree to support the child, B (not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
