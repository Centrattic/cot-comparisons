It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. I need to figure this out based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky towards the end because she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, which later was confirmed, and they broke up. She moved in with her parents, but then came back to tell him she was pregnant. He let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed he wasn't the father, he kicked her out. Now, people are telling him he's wrong for not helping the child and her, even though she cheated.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she was cheating, the financial burden, the paternity test result, and the emotional state of the author. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing to support her and the child once he found out he wasn't the father.\n\nI need to consider legal, moral, and social aspects. Legally, if the author isn't the biological father, he's not obligated to provide financial support unless he's been acting as the legal father. But in the scenario, he was willing to support her and the child until the test showed he wasn't the father. So legally, once he knows he's not the father, there's no obligation.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. Some might argue that he's being selfish by not helping an unwed mother, especially since the child is innocent. However, the author is dealing with betrayal and the emotional fallout of being cheated on. He might feel manipulated if she used the pregnancy to get him to support another man's child. On the other hand, he initially agreed to support her, so changing his mind after the test could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable time.\n\nSocially, the mutual friends and her friends are pressuring him to take her back, which might reflect societal expectations that men should support the mother and child even if the child isn't theirs. But there's also the consideration of his own well-being and the fact that she had already cheated on him, which is a valid reason for ending the relationship.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he's emotionally raw and doesn't want to be responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after the betrayal. His decision to kick her out could be seen as self-preservation. However, others might see it as heartless to leave her when she's pregnant, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. If he had accepted the child as his own and then found out it wasn't, some might argue he's responsible for his initial acceptance. But if he had conditions (like the paternity test), he might not be obligated once that condition is met.\n\nAlso, the fact that she returned after the breakup to tell him about the pregnancy might be seen as an attempt to manipulate him into staying. If she had known the father was someone else, she might have used the pregnancy to force him into a relationship or support. That could be a reason for the author to feel wronged.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the author's decision to leave after the paternity test is confirmed might be justified, especially given the cheating and the initial condition of the test. However, the moral responsibility to help an unwed mother is a societal expectation that some might hold against him. But considering the betrayal and the agreed-upon condition, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
