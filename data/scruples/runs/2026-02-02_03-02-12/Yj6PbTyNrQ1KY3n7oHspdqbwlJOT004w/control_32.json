It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. The story goes that they were together for two years, things got rocky, he broke up with her, she came back pregnant, they agreed to a paternity test, and when it turned negative, he made her leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a man is not automatically responsible for a child unless there's legal acknowledgment of paternity. Since the test proved he's not the father, he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. However, there could be social and moral considerations beyond the law.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The woman cheated, which is a betrayal. The author's decision to let her stay initially was based on the assumption of parenthood. Once that was proven false, his feelings changed. The author might feel justified in cutting ties, especially after the emotional trauma of the breakup and the infidelity. However, some might argue that even without being the biological father, he has a moral responsibility, especially since he allowed her to stay in his home during the pregnancy.\n\nAlso, the mother's circumstances are poor. Her parents smoke, which is harmful to the unborn child. The author might believe that the child is better off not in his home now, but is it his duty to step in? Others might say he's not responsible and should focus on his own well-being, especially after the betrayal.\n\nThere's also the emotional toll on the author. He's been through a breakup, possible infidelity, and the stress of a paternity test. His mental health is a factor here. He's struggling with feelings of guilt and pressure from friends, but his decision to leave might be a way to protect himself.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman is dealing with a difficult situation. She's pregnant, possibly in a stressful home environment, and now she's been abandoned by someone who initially supported her. Friends and mutual contacts are criticizing the author, which could indicate societal pressure to support the child regardless of paternity.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't the biological father, the relationship was already broken, cheating occurred, and the author's emotional state. Legally, he's not responsible, but morally, some might argue that he has a duty because he allowed her to stay and then left abruptly. However, others might say he's not obligated and acting in self-preservation.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author isn't the father, so his responsibility isn't automatic. He's also been wronged by the mother's infidelity. His decision to ask her to leave might be seen as self-respect and protecting himself from further emotional harm. However, the abruptness and the child's well-being could be points against him. But since he's not the father, maybe he's not in the wrong. So leaning towards answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
