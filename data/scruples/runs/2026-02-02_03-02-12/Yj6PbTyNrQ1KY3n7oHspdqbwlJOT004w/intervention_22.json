It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship, it got rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading the author to break up. She then came back saying she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. After the test showed it wasn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, he's being criticized by friends and the ex for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author suspected cheating, which was later confirmed. The ex was living off his money, and he broke up with her. Then she came back with a pregnancy claim. They agreed on a paternity test. The test cleared him, and he asked her to leave. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, legally, if the paternity test shows he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, broken trust. He might feel betrayed. But the ex could argue that the child is still a human being and deserves support regardless of the father's identity. \n\nBut the author didn't know the truth until the test. Once it was clear he wasn't the father, his responsibility ends. The ex chose to stay with him under the premise that he was the father. Once that's proven false, he's not obligated to help. Also, the ex's own family might not be a safe environment, but the author isn't responsible for that. \n\nThe friends saying he should help might be out of guilt or empathy for the child, but unless he's the legal father, he's not required to. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
