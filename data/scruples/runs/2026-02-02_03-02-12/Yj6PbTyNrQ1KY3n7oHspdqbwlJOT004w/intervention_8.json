It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author had a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. They broke up because she wasn't working and he suspected her of cheating. Then she came back saying she's pregnant and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now people are criticizing him.\n\nFirst, the key points: He's not the biological father. He suspected cheating, which turned out to be true. He allowed her to stay under the condition of a test. Once the test confirmed it's not his, he ends the arrangement. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his. Legally, paternity is determined by the test, so he's not responsible for the child's care. Emotionally, he's gone through a breakup, possible betrayal, and then the stress of dealing with a pregnancy. His decision might be seen as self-preservation after realizing he's not the father.\n\nHowever, morally, some might argue that he should still help the pregnant woman out of compassion, even if he's not the father. But others might say he's not responsible for someone else's child and is within his rights to prioritize his own well-being. The woman's friends are messaging him to take her back, but he's not under any obligation to do so. \n\nHe did offer support initially when he believed the child was his, but once the test cleared that up, his responsibility ends. The author's actions are in line with making a decision based on new information. So, in my view, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
