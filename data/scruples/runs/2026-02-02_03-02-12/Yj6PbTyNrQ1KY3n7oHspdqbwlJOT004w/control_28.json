It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple had been together for two years. The relationship became rocky when the girlfriend lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on the author's financial support. The author suspected cheating and eventually broke up with her, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant, and he allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test. The result was that the child isn't his. He then told her to leave.\n\nNow, she's staying with a friend, and mutual friends are criticizing him. He's conflicted, feeling emotionally raw and questioning if he was wrong to do this. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, a biological father has certain rights, but since the test showed he's not the father, he has no legal obligations towards the child. So, he's under no legal requirement to support the child or provide housing. That's a point in his favor.\n\nEthically and morally, it's more complex. While he's not the father, he might feel a sense of responsibility because he was in a relationship with the mother. However, he's been through emotional turmoil: the breakup, financial strain, and betrayal. He might not be in a position to provide emotional or financial support for someone else's child, especially after discovering the cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he has a moral duty to support the mother, at least emotionally, especially if they were in a committed relationship. But since the child isn't his, the obligation isn't as direct. Also, the mother's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the breakup, which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe key factors here are the paternity test result, the prior relationship dynamics, and the emotional state of both parties. The author's decision to let her stay initially showed willingness to help, but the betrayal and emotional strain likely influenced his decision to ask her to leave after discovering the truth. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not the biological father and has no legal obligation. His emotional state and the prior issues in the relationship justify his decision. However, the moral perspective might vary. But based on the information given, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
