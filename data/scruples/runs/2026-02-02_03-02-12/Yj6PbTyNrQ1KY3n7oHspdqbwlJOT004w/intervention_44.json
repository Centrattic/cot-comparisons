It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support her financially. He suspected she was cheating, and eventually broke up with her, leading her to move back with her parents. Then she returned to say she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay under the condition they get a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he kicks her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not supporting the unborn child.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for kicking her out after finding out the child isn't his. Let's look at the key points here.\n\n1. **Marital and Legal Rights**: Since they aren't married, the author isn't legally obligated to support the child. Paternity is established through the test, so he has no legal responsibility. However, if he had been the father, he would have legal obligations to support the child even after a breakup. But since he isn't the father, his legal responsibility ends there.\n\n2. **Emotional and Financial Burden**: The author was already dealing with a financially burdensome situation, and the relationship was already breaking down due to her unemployment and suspected infidelity. After the breakup, he agreed to let her stay temporarily for the paternity test. When the test came back negative, he felt betrayed again (since he suspected cheating), which added emotional trauma. His decision to ask her to leave might be a reaction to the cumulative stress and betrayal.\n\n3. **Support for the Unborn Child**: The author is being criticized for not providing a home for the unborn child. However, if he isn't the father, he isn't legally required to provide support. But ethically, some might argue that he should help, especially since he had a relationship with the mother. However, the mother is responsible for the child's care, and it's up to her to seek support from others. The author might not feel responsible if he wasn't the father and the relationship was already over.\n\n4. **Emotional State and Mental Health**: The author mentions feeling emotionally raw, which could affect his judgment. He's struggling between his feelings of responsibility and his own well-being. It's possible he's acting out of hurt from the betrayal and the stress of the situation.\n\n5. **Social and Moral Pressure**: Friends are pressuring him to take her back, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. His decision is personal and based on his own circumstances. However, social pressure can make it hard to see the situation objectively.\n\n6. **Alternatives and Resources**: Is there a way to support the child without making the author feel overburdened? The author could have helped financially if he wanted, but he's not obligated. If the mother is in a harmful environment (her parents smoke), maybe there are other resources available, like social services or community support, rather than relying on the ex-partner.\n\n7. **Trust and Betrayal**: The author had already broken up with her due to suspected cheating. The paternity test confirmed the cheating, which adds to the betrayal. His emotional response is understandable given the history.\n\nPutting this all together, the author isn't legally wrong. Legally, he's not responsible for a child that isn't his. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might argue that he should help because he was part of the mother's life, but others might say it's not his responsibility. The key factors are that the relationship was already over, he wasn't the father, and he's dealing with the aftermath of betrayal. His decision to ask her to leave might be seen as self-preservation after the emotional and financial strain.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for criticism. If he had agreed to let her stay temporarily for the test, some might argue he should have followed through with support, given the circumstances. But since the paternity wasn't his, the responsibility shifts back to her. It's important to consider his emotional state and the fact that he's not in a position to support someone else's child without being the father. So, while some might see his actions as harsh, legally and morally, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
