It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the context: They were in a 2-year relationship. The relationship got rocky when the girlfriend lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on the author's finances. The author suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Later, she came back, pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main points to consider. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Emotionally, he had already been through a breakup, suspected infidelity, and now a betrayal of trust. He allowed her to stay under the assumption he was the father, which was a significant emotional investment. When the truth came out, he felt betrayed again, which led to his decision to ask her to leave.\n\nHowever, the ex and mutual friends are arguing that he should still help her out. But does he have a responsibility? Since he's not the father, there's no legal obligation. But morally, some might argue that staying with her during the pregnancy, even if not the father, could imply a commitment. However, the arrangement was contingent on the paternity test. Once that was proven false, maybe his obligation ended.\n\nThe author's emotional state is crucial here. He's been through a lot, and the betrayal might have made it difficult for him to continue supporting her. The fact that she cheated confirms his suspicions, adding to his trauma. So, from his perspective, ending the arrangement makes sense.\n\nBut from another angle, the unborn child is innocent. The author is now cutting off support at a vulnerable time. However, since he's not the biological father, the responsibility isn't his. The ex is the one who needs to take care of the child. The author might still have ethical considerations if he's in a committed relationship, but since they're broken up, his responsibilities might not extend beyond that.\n\nThe key here is that the author made an agreement based on the assumption of paternity. Once that assumption was proven wrong, the basis for allowing her to stay was gone. So his decision to ask her to leave isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's not legally or morally bound to support a child that isn't his. The emotional turmoil adds context but doesn't inherently make his decision wrong.\n"
