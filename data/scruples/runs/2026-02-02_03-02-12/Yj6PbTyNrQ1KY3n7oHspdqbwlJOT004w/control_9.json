It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the context: They broke up earlier because she stopped working and relied on him financially, and he suspected her of cheating. She later approached him with a pregnancy, and he agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he made her leave.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, paternity is a big factor. If the test shows he's not the father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. But morally, it's trickier. The ex was staying with him to avoid her parents' smoking, which is a health concern for the unborn child. The author is being criticized by others for not helping, but he's also dealing with emotional turmoil from the breakup and her cheating.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to his own emotional well-being and might not want to be involved with a child that isn't his. On the other hand, there's the argument about the child's welfare and not leaving the pregnant woman in a difficult situation. However, since the child isn't his, he's not legally responsible, and his decision could be seen as self-preservation after betrayal. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Could he have offered temporary help or referred her to social services instead of cutting her off? That might have been more compassionate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he followed through with the paternity test and the result changed his stance, his actions are based on new information. Legally, he's not responsible, and morally, while it's harsh, it's not necessarily wrong given the circumstances. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not obligated, and the decision was made after a test confirmed the child isn't his. However, there's a nuance where supporting her in another way might have been better, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the optimal solution.\n"
