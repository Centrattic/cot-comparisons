It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who found out his pregnant girlfriend was cheating, allowed her to stay, got a paternity test which showed he wasn't the father, and then kicked her out. Now friends are calling him a bad person for not supporting the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man had a troubled relationship, broke up, then let her stay when she got pregnant, but only after agreeing to a paternity test. The test showed he wasn't the father, so he asked her to leave. The main question is whether he's wrong for not letting her stay now.\n\nLegally, if he's not the biological father, he doesn't have legal obligations towards the child. However, there's the aspect of moral responsibility. The woman cheated, which is a betrayal. The man might feel he's not responsible for someone else's child, especially after being deceived. On the other hand, some might argue that once you're involved in a relationship, you might have some responsibility regardless of paternity. But the paternity test cleared that up, so legally and factually, he's not the father. Emotionally, he's been through a lot, and the friends are pressuring him. \n\nThe woman's friends are saying he should help, but he's not the biological father. If he wasn't aware of the infidelity before, and the paternity test proved it, then he's not obligated. However, maybe there's a social expectation of support even if he's not the father. But the man might have valid reasons to not want to be involved after being lied to. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's not the biological father and was deceived. But there's a nuance where some might feel he has a moral duty. However, legally and factually, the answer is B.\n"
