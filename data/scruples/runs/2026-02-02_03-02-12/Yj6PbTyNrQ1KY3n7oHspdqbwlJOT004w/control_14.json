It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he had a girlfriend who got pregnant. He suspected she was cheating and eventually broke up with her. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed he wasn't the father, and he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But there might be social expectations or moral considerations. He might be thinking about his own emotional state, having been through a breakup and suspecting cheating. The pregnancy was a surprise, and when it turned out not to be his, he felt betrayed again. \n\nHe allowed her to stay in his house initially because he thought it was his child. Once the test showed it wasn't, he changed his mind. The question is whether he's being unfair by not supporting her now. On one hand, he might feel justified because the child isn't his and he's not responsible. On the other hand, she's pregnant and might need support regardless of the biological father.\n\nHe mentions that she cheated, which adds another layer. If she was unfaithful, that could contribute to his decision to leave. But does that affect his responsibility towards the child? Probably not, since the child is innocent. However, he's not the biological father, so legally, he's not bound. But morally, is he expected to help? That's debatable. \n\nHe also feels emotionally raw, which might affect his judgment. He's conflicted between his feelings of betrayal and the potential need to support her. His friends are pressuring him, which is making him question himself. \n\nI should consider if he's being selfish by not helping her. If she doesn't have her parents due to smoking, maybe he's in a position to offer a safe environment. But he might not be willing to take on the responsibility of a child he's not related to. \n\nIn terms of fairness, kicking her out after the paternity test is a personal choice, but some might see it as abandoning her in a vulnerable time. Others might see it as reasonable since he's not the father. The key points are the paternity result, her cheating, and his emotional state. \n\nI think the main issue is whether a man who isn't the biological father has a responsibility to support another man's child. Legally, no. Morally, it's subjective. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but some people might think he should help regardless. However, since the child isn't his, and given the circumstances of the relationship (cheating, financial issues before), his decision could be seen as understandable. But others might criticize him for not being more supportive. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on personal ethics. If the community values helping others regardless of relation, he might be seen as wrong. If they value personal responsibility based on relation, he's not wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the child isn't his, and he's not legally obligated, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a gray area. However, given the options, B seems more likely.\n"
