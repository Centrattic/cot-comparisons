It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend once he found out the child isn't his. The story is a bit complicated. He and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating, broke up with her, but she came back pregnant and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed he's not the father, so he kicked her out. Now mutual friends are saying he's being terrible.\n\nHmm, first, I need to look at the facts. The key points here are consent, the paternity test agreement, and the aftermath. The author agreed to let her stay under the condition that they get a paternity test. She agreed. Once the test showed he's not the father, he ended the arrangement. But now she's moving in with others, and he's being criticized.\n\nLegally, if there's no legal obligation for him to support the child, especially since he's not the father, he's not in the wrong. But socially, people might argue he should help because the woman is vulnerable. However, the story mentions that she cheated, which adds another layer. Also, he was already in a stressful situation with her living with him when she was unemployed. Now that it's confirmed she's not his child, maybe he's justified in cutting ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman is pregnant and might be in a tough spot. The author is being accused of being cruel, but if he's not the father and there's no legal responsibility, maybe he's not at fault. Also, the mutual friends' opinions might be biased. The fact that she's staying with a friend shows she has alternatives, so maybe he's not being unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle: the author's emotional state. He's going through a lot, and the betrayal of cheating confirmed. His reaction might be driven by hurt and betrayal, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. The paternity test was a mutual agreement, so the outcome led to his decision. He's not obligated to take care of someone else's child, especially if he's not the father and there's no legal responsibility.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say he should have considered the woman's situation more, but if she's not his child, and he's not the one who got her pregnant, it's not his responsibility. Also, the cheating adds to the betrayal, which could justify his decision.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on the paternity test and his own well-being. The answer is B.\n"
