It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the kid isn't his. They broke up earlier when she lost her job and wasn't working, and he suspected her of cheating. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, he lets her stay but with a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, it's more complex. Even if he's not the father, he might still feel responsible if he was in a relationship with the mother. However, he was already in a breakup situation, and she came back expecting support. \n\nHe provided her a place to stay because of her mother's smoking, which was a valid concern for the child's health. But after the test, he changed his mind. The ex and others are accusing him of being a terrible person for not continuing to help. \n\nHe's dealing with emotional trauma from cheating and the breakup. He's conflicted between his emotions and societal expectations. Does he have a moral duty to help if he's not the father? Maybe not, but some might argue that he's being selfish. \n\nOn the other hand, he's been through a lot, and his decision is based on his own emotional state and the confirmed betrayal. He's not legally bound, so he's within his rights to refuse. However, some might see it as abandoning a vulnerable person. \n\nThe key points are the emotional impact on both sides and the legality vs. ethics. Since the question is about being wrong, it's more about social judgment. If the community sees him as in the wrong (AITA), then answer A. But if he's justified, then B. \n\nI think it's a tough call. He's not legally wrong, but socially, there's pressure to support. His actions might be seen as harsh, but he's not obligated. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong, because he's acting based on test results and his own emotional state.\n"
