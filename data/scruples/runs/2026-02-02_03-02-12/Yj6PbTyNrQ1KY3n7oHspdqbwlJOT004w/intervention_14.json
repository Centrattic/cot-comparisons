It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who found out the child his ex-girlfriend is carrying isn't his and decided to kick her out of his house. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a 2-year relationship that ended because his ex wasn't working and he suspected her of cheating. She came back pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, he's being criticized by friends for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to ask her to leave. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, in most places, a man is not automatically responsible for a child unless proven through paternity tests. Since the test showed he's not the father, he has no legal obligation. Ethically, it's more complex. The author was already emotionally involved and had his own reasons for not wanting to support someone else's child. However, there's also the argument that he might feel a moral responsibility to help, even if not legally required.\n\nThe author mentions feeling emotionally raw after discovering the infidelity and the betrayal. That's a significant factor. People can have different reactions to such situations. The ex-girlfriend's friends are pressuring him to take her back, but their perspective might not consider his emotional state.\n\nI should also consider if there's any element of coercion or manipulation. The ex used the pregnancy to get back into his house, knowing he wanted to be a father. Then, after the test, she's left vulnerable. But the author agreed to the test and had the right to make decisions based on the results.\n\nThere's a balance between personal responsibility and personal well-being. The author isn't obligated to support someone else's child, especially after being lied about paternity. However, some might argue that abandoning her could be harsh. But the author isn't refusing help entirely; he's just not taking in her and the child into his home.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not legally responsible and he made a decision based on the paternity test results. His emotional state and past betrayal justify his actions. So the answer should be B.\n"
