It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child wasn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship. It got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she moved out. Later, she returned, pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay to avoid her parents smoking. They agreed to a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out.\n\nNow, considering the factors: He was already under stress from the breakup, financial strain, and suspicion of cheating. He had a prior agreement for the test. Once the results showed the child wasn't his, he felt betrayed and decided to end the arrangement. His friends are pressuring him to take responsibility.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, the child is innocent, and cutting off support might leave the ex in a difficult situation. On the other hand, the author feels he's not the biological father, and the relationship was already broken. The ex's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the breakup. \n\nBut wait, the ex might have known the child wasn't his when she came back pregnant. That could be a key point. If she intentionally lied, that's a different scenario. Also, by agreeing to the paternity test, he trusted her, and her beaming with glee might indicate she didn't expect the result to be negative. \n\nLegally, if he's not the biological father, he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through a lot, and his decision to end the arrangement after the betrayal could be seen as self-preservation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once he agreed to let her stay, he took on a moral responsibility, regardless of paternity. But others might say that without knowing the child wasn't his, he was acting under a false premise, and once that's resolved, his obligation ends.\n\nThe ex's friends arguing he should take care of the child might be ignoring the circumstances. The author's mental and emotional state is also a factor; he's been through a lot and needs to prioritize his own well-being.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He had a prior agreement, and once the test results came in, he could reasonably decide to end the arrangement. The ex's actions during the relationship contributed to the breakdown. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
