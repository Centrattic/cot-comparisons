It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he let his pregnant ex-girlfriend stay with him when she told him she was pregnant, thinking it was his child. They agreed to a paternity test, and when it turned out the kid wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's being a bad person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. He had already broken up with her because of financial issues and suspected cheating. Then she came back, pregnant, and he allowed her to stay, probably feeling responsible. But when the test showed the child wasn't his, he felt relieved and no longer wanted to help.\n\nThe main question is whether he was unfair. Well, he wasn't the biological father, so maybe he doesn't have a legal responsibility. But there's the emotional aspect. Did he take advantage of her situation? Or was he justified in not wanting to support another man's child, especially after a bad breakup?\n\nHe suspected cheating, which was confirmed later. That betrayal might have influenced his decision. However, even if he was hurt, the unborn child is innocent. By kicking her out, he's removing support from a pregnant woman, which could be seen as heartless, even if he's not the father. \n\nHe's being criticized for not helping, but he's also under emotional stress. The key points are his responsibility towards the child. Since he's not the father, he might not have legal obligations, but morally, is it his fault? The ex cheated, so the responsibility should be on her and the actual father. \n\nBut maybe he felt some obligation because he was led to believe it was his. However, once the test cleared that up, he's not responsible. Still, abruptly kicking her out might be harsh. He could have offered other options, like helping her find resources or support while she stays with a friend. \n\nThe mutual friends think he's being a bad person, but maybe he's justified in not wanting to be tied down. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong, because he's not the father and has no legal duty. However, morally, there's a gray area. But the question is if he's in the wrong, which could depend on societal expectations versus legal facts. Since he's not the father, he's not in the wrong legally, but maybe socially, people might judge him. The answer would be B, no, he's not in the wrong.\n"
