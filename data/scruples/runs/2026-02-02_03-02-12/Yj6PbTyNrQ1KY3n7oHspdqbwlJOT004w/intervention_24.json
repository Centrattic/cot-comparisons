It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) was wrong to kick out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the context: They were in a two-year relationship. It got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected cheating and broke up, she went to her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. The test showed he's not the father, and he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, paternity is a big factor. If the test proves he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, suspected infidelity, and the stress of possibly being a father. The ex might have known he wanted to be a father and manipulated him into staying, only for him to find out it's not his child. That betrayal could be a major factor in his decision to leave her.\n\nBut then there's the argument about the unborn child's well-being. Some might say he should help regardless of the situation. However, the ex's parents are problematic (smoking), so she's staying with a friend. He's in a vulnerable emotional state and might not be the best support system right now. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't obligated to care for a child that's not his. The decision to leave her might be harsh, but it's his right to prioritize his own well-being. The mutual friends judging him might not understand the full context of the relationship's issues and the betrayal. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He had the paternity test done, fulfilled the agreement, and made a decision based on the test results. The main responsibility for the child's care would fall on the biological father, which he's not. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
