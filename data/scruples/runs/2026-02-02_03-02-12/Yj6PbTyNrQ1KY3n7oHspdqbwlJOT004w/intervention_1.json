It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) was wrong to kick his pregnant ex out after discovering the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the ex was already in a rocky situation. They had broken up because she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected her of cheating, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay temporarily with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author agreed to let her stay under the pretense of the child being his, but after the test, he changed his mind. The ex and others are criticizing him for not helping the child. The author is questioning his own actions, feeling torn between his emotional state and the pressure to help.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author wasn't obligated to take care of someone else's child. He had made an arrangement based on the assumption of paternity, which was later proven false. Once that assumption was gone, he's no longer responsible for the child. His decision to ask her to leave was based on the fact that the child isn't his, and he's under no legal or moral obligation to support another man's child. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that she might be in a vulnerable position, but the author's actions were in response to betrayal and emotional stress. While some might argue he should help regardless, the fact that the child isn't his removes any legal responsibility. Morally, it's a gray area, but the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a choice to prioritize his own well-being after discovering the child isn't his. \n\nAlso, the ex's friends might be pressuring him, but their opinions don't necessarily validate his responsibility. The key here is that the paternity test changed the scenario. The author isn't in the wrong for not taking on responsibilities for a child that isn't his. So, the answer is B.\n"
