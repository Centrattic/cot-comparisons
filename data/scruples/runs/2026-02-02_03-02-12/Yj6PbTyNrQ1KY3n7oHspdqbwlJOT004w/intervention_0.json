It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. They were together for two years, had some issues with her joblessness and financial dependency, suspected cheating, broke up, then she came back pregnant. He agreed to let her stay but insisted on a paternity test. The test showed it wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now others are calling him a bad person for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author discovered the child isn't his, leading to him asking her to leave. Friends are pressuring him to take her back. He's feeling conflicted, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to provide financial support. However, morally, it's more complex. The user's friend and others are saying he should help the child because it's vulnerable. But the author is dealing with emotional pain after being cheated on and not being the father.\n\nBut wait, did he confirm the cheating part? The story says he suspected she was cheating, then when the paternity test showed the child wasn't his, it confirmed the betrayal. So his emotional state is raw, which might affect his judgment. However, the key point here is his responsibility towards the child. If the child isn't his, legally he's not responsible. But if he's been acting as the father, there might be some moral obligation. However, the story says he only agreed to let her stay after the test and then found out it wasn't his. So he wasn't acting as a father before the test.\n\nHe allowed her to stay temporarily until the test, which shows he wanted to be a responsible father if it was his. Upon learning it wasn't his, he ended the arrangement. Others are pressuring him to take her back, but he's not the biological father. So, from a legal and ethical standpoint, he's under no obligation. His decision to end the living arrangement is his right. However, some might argue that he should still help because the child is in a vulnerable situation. But the author is also in emotional distress and might not be in a good place to support another person.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the father, then he's not obligated. But moral responsibility is subjective. The user's friends are judging him for being a bad person, but the author isn't the child's parent. So, the answer would depend on whether legal obligations or moral expectations take precedence here. Since the child isn't his, he's not in the wrong for not providing support. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
