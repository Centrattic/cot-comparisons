It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple was together for two years, but things got rocky when she lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and broke up, so she went to live with her parents. Then she came back, told him she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, and he asked her to leave. Now mutual friends and her friends are saying he's in the wrong for not helping the unborn child.\n\nThe main question is whether he's in the wrong for kicking her out after the paternity test. Let's consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he's not obligated to financially support the child. However, the woman is pregnant, and she might need support regardless of the father's identity. \n\nEmotionally, the man is dealing with betrayal (she cheated) and the stress of potential parenthood. But the woman is now pregnant with someone else's child, and he's choosing not to support her. The friends are arguing he should take responsibility, but he's not the biological father. \n\nPossible angles: Was he wrong to let emotions about cheating and financial burden affect his decision? Is the unborn child's well-being more important than his feelings? Legally, he's not responsible, but morally, does he have a duty to provide any support? Also, the woman's parents smoke, which is harmful to the fetus, so his initial offer to let her stay was for the child's health. Now that he's not the father, maybe he feels less responsible.\n\nBut the woman is still pregnant, and she might be in a vulnerable situation. Even if he's not the father, is it morally right to leave her without support? However, the woman cheated, and he might have been misled. The key here is that the decision was based on the paternity test results. \n\nIn terms of morality, some might say he's justified because he's not the father and was cheated on. Others might say that regardless of the father's identity, he's in a position where the woman is in need. But legally, he's not obligated. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more of a moral judgment. \n\nI think the answer would depend on societal views on responsibility towards children and cheating. Since he's not the father, legally and morally, he might not be in the wrong. But others might argue that he should have a compassionate approach. However, given the cheating and his own emotional state, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
