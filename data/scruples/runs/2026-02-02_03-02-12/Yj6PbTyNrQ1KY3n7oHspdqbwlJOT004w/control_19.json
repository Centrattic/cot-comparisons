It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after a paternity test showed the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. She lost her job, stopped looking for work, and he had to support them. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave again.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, if the paternity test confirms the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But the question is more about moral or ethical responsibility. The user is feeling conflicted because others are calling him a bad person, but he's emotionally raw and feels betrayed.\n\nHe provided a home initially to protect the child from her parents' environment, but once the paternity was confirmed not to be his, he changed his mind. The ex and friends are pressuring him to take responsibility. The user is struggling with whether he's being unfair to the unborn child.\n\nLegally, unless there's a legal obligation (like if he signed documents or there's a court order), he's not required to support a child that isn't his. However, morally, some might argue that offering support regardless of the biological connection could be seen as the compassionate choice. But others might say that after the betrayal (cheating and financial strain), it's understandable for him to step back.\n\nThe user's main argument is that the child isn't his, and he's not in a good emotional state. He's been through a lot, and the betrayal from cheating was confirmed. So, from his perspective, he's justified in not wanting to take responsibility. However, the counter-argument is that the child is innocent and deserves support regardless of the parents' situation.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on societal and moral standards. Some might say he's not in the wrong because he's not the biological father and has no legal duty. Others might argue that once he committed to helping, he should follow through regardless of the test result. However, the initial agreement was based on the assumption of paternity. Once that's invalidated, the obligation could be considered lifted.\n\nAlso, the emotional state of the author is a factor. He's been through a lot, and the betrayal likely affected his mental health. It's reasonable for him to prioritize his own well-being, especially if he's not the legal father.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might criticize his decision, legally and considering the context, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
