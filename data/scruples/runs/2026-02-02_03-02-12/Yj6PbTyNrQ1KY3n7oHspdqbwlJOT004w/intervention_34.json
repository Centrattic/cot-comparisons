It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, they were in a 2-year relationship. The last few months were tough because the girlfriend lost her job, didn't look for work, and the author had to support both financially. There were suspicions of cheating, leading to a breakup and her moving in with her parents.\n\nThen, she came back saying she's pregnant. The author let her stay again, but with the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, it came back negative. The author told her to leave. Now, she's with friends, and their friends are telling the author he's being a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nThe author feels conflicted. He's been through emotional turmoil, betrayal, and is now questioning if he was wrong to kick her out. The user says they think the author is not in the wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author had a right to ask her to leave after discovering the child isn't his. Let's consider the facts. The author agreed to her staying under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed it's not his, he's no longer obligated to take care of her. The initial agreement was based on the assumption that he was the father. If that's not the case, his responsibility changes.\n\nAlso, the author had already gone through a breakup due to cheating and financial strain. He's not legally bound to support a child that isn't his. The girlfriend's friends and mutual friends are pressuring him, but the author's well-being and circumstances matter too. He might be in a vulnerable state emotionally, and it's reasonable for him to prioritize his own mental health after betrayal and stress.\n\nHowever, there's a potential ethical angle. Even though the child isn't his, is he morally responsible? But unless there's a legal obligation, he's not. The mother has the primary responsibility. The author isn't at fault for not taking on a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship has ended. The key here is that the arrangement was conditional on the paternity test result. Once that condition is negated, the agreement is void.\n\nAnother point: the author allowed her to stay with the understanding that the child might be his. Once that's proven otherwise, he's not obligated to continue the arrangement. The friends' judgment might be based on emotions, but legally and ethically, the author isn't responsible for the child now.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. He followed through on the condition he set, and there's no legal or moral obligation for him to take care of a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship has broken down.\n"
