It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. They had a rocky relationship, she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, he suspected her of cheating, broke up with her, then she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay but wanted a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he made her leave. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the child is not his, he's not obligated to provide support. But there's the moral side. Even if it's not his child, he might feel responsible because he was involved in the pregnancy. But he had a right to know if the child was his, and once he found out it wasn't, he might feel betrayed again, especially if she knew but didn't tell him. \n\nHe had already broken up with her for cheating, and now the child isn't his. Maybe she was trying to trap him or manipulate him. That's a possibility. If she knew the child wasn't his and still told him she was pregnant, that's a lie. That would be a betrayal. So he might feel justified in cutting ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the unborn child is innocent. The author is being pressured to take care of the child. But if he's not the father, he's not legally or morally required to. However, if he's in a position to help, maybe he should. But he's also going through emotional trauma. The mutual friends are calling him a bad person, but they might not know the full story. \n\nThe key points are: she cheated, he suspected it, she lost her job, he supported her, then she came back with a pregnancy he thought was his. The test proved otherwise. He felt betrayed again. Is it fair to kick her out? Legally no, but ethically, if she lied about the paternity, maybe he's justified. But the child is innocent. However, the author isn't the biological father. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he had the right to know the truth. Once the truth came out, he's not responsible. But if he knew about the pregnancy and didn't take steps to help, that could be another angle. However, the paternity test was a condition he set, and she agreed. So once the test was done, he had the right to make that decision. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he was deceived, and once the truth came out, he's not obligated to take care of someone else's child. The people judging him might not understand the full situation, like the cheating and deception involved. So the answer is B.\n"
