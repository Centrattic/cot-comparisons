It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out of his house after finding out the baby isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. They were together for two years, things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work. He suspected cheating, broke up with her, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back because her mom smokes, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo the key points here are paternity, consent to stay, and the sudden change in his behavior after the test. The author's argument is that he was emotionally affected after the betrayal and the cheating was confirmed. He's struggling with whether he was unfair to the child.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support them. But emotionally and socially, there might be expectations. The woman cheated, but the child is innocent. The author might feel he's justified in cutting ties because the child isn't his, but others see him as abandoning someone in need. \n\nMoral considerations come into play. Even if the child isn't his, the woman is in a vulnerable state. Some might argue he should help regardless, while others might agree with him prioritizing his emotional well-being. Cheating complicates things, but the child's well-being is separate. \n\nI need to consider if there's any legal responsibility or if the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The woman knew he was paying for her to stay there under the condition of the test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he might feel justified in ending the arrangement. \n\nHowever, the woman is now in a difficult position, and he might have obligations to help her find alternative support. But he's also allowed to prioritize his mental health. The answer might depend on societal expectations versus personal rights. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong is subjective. Legally, he's not obligated. Morally, some might say yes, but others might side with him. The question is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer could be A (yes) or B (no) based on differing perspectives. But I need to look for any clear ethical violations. Since he was upfront about the paternity test and she agreed, his actions might be seen as justified once the test proved the child isn't his. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
