It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated with a lot of emotions involved. So, the author's ex-girlfriend is pregnant, but the child isn't his. They were in a two-year relationship that ended when he suspected cheating and she lost her job. He let her come back to live with him after she told him she was pregnant, but they agreed to a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, even if a man isn't the biological father, if he's been acting as the father (like supporting the mother and child), he might have legal responsibilities. But in this case, the author hasn't been acting as the father yet because the child isn't born. So maybe there's no legal obligation right now. But legally, the mother has the right to choose where she lives, so kicking her out might not be illegal, but it's more about morality.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. The author is dealing with betrayal\u2014his ex cheated, and now he's found out the child isn't his. He's under a lot of stress. The ex's friends are saying he should help because the child is innocent. But the author feels he's been through a lot emotionally and isn't ready to support a child that's not his. \n\nHe did agree to the paternity test and followed through. Once the results came back, he had the right to change his mind. However, he did let her stay with him after the pregnancy announcement, which might imply some level of commitment. But since the child isn't his, maybe he's not obligated beyond that. \n\nThe ex's mom smoking is a valid concern. The author might think he's doing what's best for the child's health by keeping her away from smoke. But by kicking her out, he's making her go back to her parents where there's smoke. That's a bit contradictory. However, he says she's staying with a friend to avoid the smoke, so maybe that's a temporary solution.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling betrayed and overwhelmed. Cheating is a big deal, and the stress of possibly raising another's child could be too much. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his mental health. But others might argue he should still help because the child is innocent. However, the author didn't cause the pregnancy or the cheating; he's reacting to the situation as it is now.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the biological father, so he doesn't have a legal duty. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might say he should help, others might say he's within his rights to leave. The key here is that the author made his decision after the paternity test, which he agreed to in good faith. He's not the one who caused the situation, so it's not entirely his fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a decision based on the information he has, even if it's harsh. The answer is B.\n"
