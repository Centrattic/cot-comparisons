It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. They broke up because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. She left to live with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed she wasn't pregnant with his child, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not taking care of the child.\n\nI need to analyze if he's in the wrong. Legally, paternity tests are the standard way to establish fatherhood. If the test comes back negative, the man isn't legally obligated to support the child. Emotionally, the author was already dealing with the breakup, possible cheating, and financial stress. The woman cheated, so there's a betrayal. The author might feel justified in not supporting a child that isn't his, especially after the cheating.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once the child is born, the author has a moral responsibility regardless of the paternity test. But the test was done before the child was born, so maybe he's within his rights to not take responsibility. The woman's friends are pressuring him, but their arguments might be based on empathy for the unborn child rather than legal or factual considerations.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the woman's situation more. She's pregnant, vulnerable, and not in a good environment with her parents. But he's also under stress and has already been through a difficult breakup. The author's decision could be seen as self-preservation after the betrayal. \n\nThe key points are the legal aspect of paternity, the circumstances of the relationship, and the emotional state of both parties. Legally, the author isn't responsible. Emotionally, it's a tough spot. The woman's friends might be advocating for the child's well-being, but the author isn't the legal father. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
