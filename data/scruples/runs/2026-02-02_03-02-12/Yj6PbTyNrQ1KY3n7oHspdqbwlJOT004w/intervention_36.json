It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who kicked their pregnant girlfriend out after a paternity test showed the child wasn't theirs. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me recap the details. The author and his ex were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected her of cheating, broke up with her, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and the author agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's wrong for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to kick her out. From a legal standpoint, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. Financial responsibility for a child typically falls on the biological father or the mother. Since he's not the father, he's under no legal requirement to provide support. However, this is more about emotional and ethical responsibility.\n\nEmotionally, the author went through a breakup, suspected cheating, and then the paternity test confirmed his fears. He might feel betrayed. On the other hand, the ex is pregnant and in a vulnerable position. The author is being asked by mutual friends to take her back, but he's struggling with whether he should.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not the father. People have the right to make decisions about their own homes and lives. The ex is an adult and responsible for her own choices. The author isn't obligated to provide a home he doesn't want to give. However, there's a moral aspect where someone might argue he should help, but morally it's not a requirement unless there's an agreement.\n\nThe author did allow her to stay temporarily for the test, which was a fair condition. Once the test was done and he was proven not to be the father, he's within his rights to ask her to leave. The friends' opinions don't necessarily make him wrong; they're expressing concern but not a legal or ethical obligation.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say he's being heartless because the child is vulnerable. However, the author is also dealing with his own emotional turmoil. It's a balance between personal rights and social responsibility. Since he's not the father, his responsibility isn't as clear-cut. Also, the fact that she cheated on him adds to the betrayal, which might justify his reaction.\n\nIn conclusion, legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. He's not the father, so he can choose not to support the child. However, if he had accepted the child as his own before the test, there might be more expectations. But since the test cleared that up, his decision to ask her to leave is justified.\n"
