It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after a paternity test revealed the child isn't his. They were together for two years, had a rocky end when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading him to break up. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. After the test shows he's not the father, he asks her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if he wasn't the biological father, he might not have obligations towards the child. But in some places, if you act like a parent, maybe you have some responsibilities. However, the question is more about being in the wrong rather than legal obligations. \n\nEthically, the user is conflicted. He's being told by friends and others that he's a bad person for not caring for the unborn child. But he's also been through emotional turmoil with her cheating and financial strain. The key points here are consent and the circumstances. He allowed her to stay with the condition of a paternity test, which she agreed to. Once the test results came back, he followed through on the agreement. \n\nThe user didn't kick her out immediately when she first told him she was pregnant; he waited for the test. That shows he was trying to be responsible. Since the child isn't his, he might feel that he's not responsible for raising it, especially after the betrayal. However, some might argue that once he was involved in the pregnancy, he has a moral obligation to support the child, even if he's not the biological father. \n\nBut others might say it's his right to decide to live in his own home and not be part of a situation where he's not the father. The fact that her mother smokes in the house could be a valid concern for the child's health, so he might have thought he was doing the right thing by providing a smoke-free environment. However, once the test results show he's not the father, his responsibility might not extend to the child. \n\nThe user is also under a lot of emotional stress. He mentions feeling raw and sometimes agreeing with people who think he should take her back. But he's sticking to his decision. The question is whether that's fair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the agreement was clear\u2014\u8ba9\u5979\u4f4f\u5728\u4ed6\u5bb6\u4f46\u5fc5\u987b\u505a\u4eb2\u5b50\u9274\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u5979\u540c\u610f\u4e86\u2014\u90a3\u4e48\u4ed6\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u51fa\u6765\u540e\u8ba9\u5979\u79bb\u5f00\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7b97\u9519\u3002\u4f46\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5979\u6000\u5b55\u65f6\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5206\u624b\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u6709\u8d23\u4efb\u786e\u4fdd\u5979\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u5b69\u5b50\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8f6c\u4ecb\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5df2\u7ecf\u8ba9\u5979\u642c\u56de\u7236\u6bcd\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4e3a\u5438\u70df\u95ee\u9898\u5979\u9009\u62e9\u4f4f\u670b\u53cb\u5bb6\u3002\u7528\u6237\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u8be5\u627f\u62c5\u66f4\u591a\u8d23\u4efb\u5462\uff1f\n\n\u53ef\u80fd\u8981\u8003\u8651\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7ecf\u6d4e\u652f\u6301\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u540c\u5c45\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u89c9\u5f97\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u6bb5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5df2\u7ecf\u660e\u786e\u6c9f\u901a\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4ed6\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u5408\u7406\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u5728\u660e\u786e\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u9519\u3002\u4f46\u60c5\u611f\u4e0a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u8ba9\u4e8b\u60c5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u66f4\u5fae\u5999\u3002\n"
