It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author were together for two years. The relationship was already rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, making him support them both. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to live with her parents. \n\nThen she came back, pregnant, and he let her stay again because her mother smokes, which he didn't want the child to be exposed to. He set a condition for a paternity test. They agreed, and after the test showed he wasn't the father, he asked her to leave. Now, friends are criticizing him for being a bad person, but he's conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: he was in a financial strain, suspected cheating (which was later confirmed), and after finding out the child isn't his, he doesn't want to be involved. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nLegally, if he's not the biological father, he might not have legal obligations. Emotionally and ethically, though, there's complexity. He had already been through a breakup, and the emotional toll is mentioned. He's being pressured by mutual friends, but he feels he's been through enough.\n\nBut wait, he allowed her to stay in his house under the condition of the paternity test. He had a right to know if the child was his. Once it wasn't, he might feel no responsibility. However, the unborn child's well-being is a consideration. He provided a safe environment initially, but after the test, he's choosing not to. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex might be in a vulnerable position, and by kicking her out, he's cutting off support. But if he's not the father, is he obligated to help? It depends on personal ethics. Some might say no, others that he still has a moral obligation because he was part of her life and contributed to her pregnancy. \n\nHe also mentions she cheated, which adds to his betrayal. So, there's a mix of factors: financial stress, cheating, and sudden change in circumstances. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether one believes he's obligated to help when he's not the father. Legally, maybe not, but socially or morally, some might argue he should. However, given the context of their relationship ending and the betrayal, some might say he's not in the wrong. The friends' opinions don't necessarily make him wrong either. He's struggling emotionally, and his decision comes from a place of hurt and betrayal. So, I'm leaning towards B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
