It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author had a 2-year relationship with his ex, and things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, making him support them financially. He suspected her of cheating and ended the relationship, so she went to live with her parents. Later, she comes back saying she's pregnant and wants to stay with him again because her mom smokes a lot. He agrees but insists on a paternity test. The test shows the child isn't his, so he kicks her out. Now, friends are saying he's being a bad person for not helping the unborn child despite the betrayal.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the author was in a relationship, supported her financially when she wasn't working, ended it due to cheating suspicions and financial burden. She came back pregnant, he let her stay but with a paternity test. When it wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's wrong for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Legal Responsibility**: In many places, legal responsibility for a child only falls on the father once paternity is confirmed. If the test shows he's not the father, he has no legal obligation. However, if he was tricked into believing it was his child initially, maybe there's some legal aspect, but the test cleared that.\n\n2. **Emotional and Moral Responsibility**: He trusted her, allowed her to stay, and then found out she cheated (which he already suspected) and lied about the child's paternity. That's a betrayal. He's dealing with the emotional aftermath. From his perspective, he's not obligated to help someone else's child, especially after being cheated on.\n\n3. **Ethical Considerations**: Some might argue that once a child is involved, even if it's not his, he should step up. But others would say he's not responsible if he's not the father. The mother has the primary responsibility. However, the mother's actions (cheating, not working, etc.) suggest she's not in a good place to care for the child, but that's her issue.\n\n4. **Impact on the Unborn Child**: The argument is that the child should be taken care of. But the author isn't the father. Unless he's willing to take on a paternal role voluntarily, he isn't obligated. However, if the mother is in a bad environment (her parents smoke), maybe he could consider taking her in temporarily. But he's already been through a lot emotionally, and the betrayal might justify his decision to cut ties.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's behavior: she had a job, lost it, and stopped looking for one. Now she's staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. It's possible she's in a vulnerable position, but the author isn't her father. The mother is the one responsible for supporting the child. If she's not capable, maybe social services would come into play, but the author isn't legally required to help.\n\nAnother angle: The author did let her stay temporarily, expecting to be the father. Once the test came back negative, his obligation was over. He's not in the wrong for not taking responsibility for someone else's child, especially after being deceived. However, some might say that once a child is involved, it's a moral duty to help, but that's more of a personal choice.\n\nThe friends' arguments that he has room and should help might come from a place of compassion, but they don't consider the betrayal and the fact that he's not the father. The author has been through emotional turmoil, and his decision to remove her after the paternity test is a personal choice. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being after being betrayed.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't legally or morally obligated to help if he's not the father. The mother's situation is her responsibility. He's allowed to make decisions based on his own experiences and emotional state. Therefore, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
