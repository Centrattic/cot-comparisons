It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a girlfriend who was pregnant, but after a paternity test, he found out the child wasn't his. He then kicked her out of his house. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author and his girlfriend were together for two years, but things got rocky because she lost her job and didn't look for work, which put a strain on their finances. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here might be legal responsibility, emotional aspects, and societal expectations. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, then he isn't obligated to provide support. But maybe there's a moral obligation? Some people might argue that once you're involved in someone's life and a child is involved, you should help regardless. But others might say that if you're not the biological father, it's not your responsibility.\n\nThe author mentions he was already emotionally drained from the breakup and the cheating. His decision might be seen as self-preservation. However, the unborn child's well-being is a factor. The author's ex is living with her parents, who smoke, which is harmful. But kicking her out might leave the woman and the unborn child in a difficult situation. But the author isn't the father, so maybe he's not responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that supporting someone in need is a moral duty, even if you're not the father. But others might side with the author, considering the deceit (cheating to get pregnant with another man's child) and the emotional toll. The author might feel betrayed, which could justify his actions.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, probably not, since paternity is proven. Morally, it's subjective. If the author feels he's not the father and can't take responsibility, that's his right. However, the pressure from others might make him feel guilty. But the question is whether he's actually in the wrong. Since the paternity test cleared him, maybe he's not legally responsible, but morally, some might argue he should help. However, others might say that after being cheated on, it's reasonable to cut ties. \n\nI think the answer might be B (No), because he's not the biological father and the decision was based on the test results. But there's a lot of nuance here. The fact that she cheated on him adds to his betrayal, so his decision might be more understandable. The key is that he isn't legally obligated, and he's allowed to prioritize his own well-being after being wronged.\n"
