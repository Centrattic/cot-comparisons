It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who kicked out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The man and his ex had a complicated relationship. She lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. They broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, so he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test shows the child isn't his, he kicks her out. Now others are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and responsibility. He agreed to the paternity test and was under the impression the child was his. Once it's confirmed it's not his, he no longer feels responsible. The ex cheated, which adds to his betrayal. But others argue he should help regardless.\n\nNow, legal responsibility: if the child isn't his, he's not legally obligated to support it. However, moral responsibility is more subjective. He might feel a moral duty, but he's also dealing with emotional trauma from the cheating and the breakup. The ex's parents' smoking is a health issue, so his concern for the child's well-being is valid, even if it's not his.\n\nOthers are pressuring him to take her back, but he's struggling emotionally. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Morally, some might say he's being selfish, but others would agree he's not responsible for someone else's child. The ex's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the breakup. \n\nHe was honest about the paternity test from the start, so he wasn't misleading her. She knew the terms and agreed. So, once the test results came out, he followed through. The decision to leave is based on personal responsibility and emotional well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
