It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a man who kicked his pregnant ex out of his house after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to live with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay again, with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test, which showed the child isn't his. He then kicked her out. Now, others are criticizing him for being a bad person and telling him to help the unborn child.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, since the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to provide support. But ethically, it's more complex. He provided a home to protect the child from his ex's parents smoking. But now that the paternity is known, he's not the father. However, the mother might need support regardless. He's in a vulnerable emotional state, having been through a breakup and betrayal. Others are pressuring him to take her back, but he's questioning his own actions.\n\nPotential angles to consider: Is he responsible for the child? If the child is not his, he's not the legal father. But does he have a moral obligation? Maybe the mother expects him to help, but he's not the father. However, if he's been helping her, maybe there's a sense of responsibility. Also, kicking her out after she was living with him could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state. But he's not the father, so his obligations might not extend to the child. Yet, the mother's situation is still important. If she's staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, maybe he's still in a position to help her, not the child directly.\n\nAnother point is the emotional aspect. He's been through a lot, and the betrayal of cheating and the child not being his might have made him feel like he can't handle the situation. But is it fair to the mother and child to be kicked out? The mother might be in a tough spot, and if she's expecting him to support the child, even if not his, maybe he's being harsh. However, he's not the father, so his responsibility might end there.\n\nAlso, the fact that he agreed to the paternity test shows he wanted to be honest and take responsibility if the child was his. Once he found it wasn't, he's making a decision based on that new information. But maybe he should consider the mother's needs, even if the child isn't his. She's pregnant and might need a stable environment.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might say he should help because he was involved in the situation, even if not the father. Others might argue that he has no legal or moral obligation. The key is whether he's being unfair to the unborn child. Since the child isn't his, maybe he's not responsible. However, the mother's well-being is another factor. If he kicked her out, maybe he's being selfish by not considering her situation, even if the child isn't his.\n\nBut the original question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's a grey area. If he chose to support her initially, then changed his mind after the test, that's his choice. However, there's a possible argument that he should have considered her and the child's needs more, even if the child isn't his. But ultimately, the decision to kick her out after the paternity test result is his as the father is not involved. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's not the father and he's prioritizing his own well-being after the betrayal.\n"
