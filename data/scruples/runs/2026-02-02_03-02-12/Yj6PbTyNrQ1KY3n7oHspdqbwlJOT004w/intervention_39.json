It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. They were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, others are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here are the paternity test result and the emotional context. The author initially supported her because he thought the child was his. Once the test showed otherwise, he felt betrayed, especially since he had suspicions about cheating. He's under a lot of stress, both financially and emotionally. \n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. But morally or socially, some might argue that once he committed to supporting her during the pregnancy, he should still help. However, he was under the impression the child was his. Once that's proven false, his responsibility might not extend to a child that isn't biologically his. \n\nAlso, considering her living with her parents where there's smoking, but he's not her legal guardian, so he can't make that decision for her. Maybe she's staying with a friend for now. The friends are pressuring him, but he's struggling with his emotions. \n\nThe author's main reasons for asking her to leave were the paternity result and his own emotional state. He's feeling raw and betrayed. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he's obligated to help someone else's child, even if he's not the father. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to take responsibility for their actions, but in this scenario, the author wasn't the biological father. So, he's not legally or necessarily morally bound to help. However, some might argue that once he got involved, he should continue to support her regardless of the paternity test. But that's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the paternity test. Since the child isn't his, he's not responsible for it. His decision to ask her to leave is based on the fact that he's not the father. The cheating and the financial strain also play a role in his decision. So, he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
