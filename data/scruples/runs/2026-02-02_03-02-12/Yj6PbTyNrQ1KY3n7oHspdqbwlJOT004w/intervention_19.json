It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, broke up because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected cheating. She comes back when pregnant, he agrees to let her stay with the caveat of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he kicks her out. Now, she and others are saying he's being a terrible person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, paternity is a big deal. If the test shows he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But morally, some might argue that once he thought he was the father, he might have a responsibility. However, the article mentions he suspected cheating and had broken up with her before the pregnancy. So maybe the emotional betrayal is a factor here.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author is not the biological father, so maybe he shouldn't be forced to take care of someone else's child. But on the other hand, he did agree to let her stay, which might imply some level of commitment. However, once the paternity is confirmed, his obligations might end there.\n\nAlso, the situation with her parents smoking\u2014maybe he had good intentions to protect the child, but since it's not his, he's not responsible. The mutual friends are pressuring him, but he's feeling emotionally overwhelmed. He's gone through betrayal, breakup, and then the shock of not being the father. That's a lot to process.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I can see why. Legally, he's not the father. Emotionally, he's been through a lot. However, some might say he should still help because the child is vulnerable. But from a strict standpoint, if he has no legal responsibility and the pregnancy isn't his, his decision to not take care of the child isn't necessarily wrong. Plus, he had suspicions about her cheating, which might have been validated now.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground where he could offer some support without taking full responsibility. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for kicking her out after the paternity test. Since he's not the father, I think he's justified in his decision.\n"
