I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author refused to go to church with their girlfriend on Easter after her father's death, and it led to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author isn't religious and their girlfriend isn't either, though her family is. The girlfriend's dad died, and church was a tradition she followed with her family before. Now she can't go home, so she asked the author to go with her. The author declined because they don't believe and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend was upset, even though she said she doesn't really want to go.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect and support. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up for their girlfriend during a difficult time might be important. The girlfriend might need the emotional support, even if the church isn't meaningful to her. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her wishes or not being there for her when she's grieving. However, the author also has their own beliefs and might feel uncomfortable. But in a relationship, compromise is often necessary. The author's reasoning is that the girlfriend doesn't really want to go, but she still asked him to go, which might indicate she wanted his presence as a gesture of support rather than the actual church service. So maybe the author didn't consider that the gesture itself was important, leading to the conflict. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't support their partner's needs, even if it's not their own belief system.\n"
