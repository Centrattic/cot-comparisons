I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author isn't religious, and their girlfriend isn't either except for holidays. Her family is religious, and she went to church with them on big days. Now, after her dad's death, she wanted to go to church on Easter because that's a tradition, but the author refused, saying they don't need to because they're not religious. The girlfriend got upset.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B. Let's break it down. The key points are the author's lack of religious belief, the girlfriend's mixed feelings about religion, and the conflict over a tradition after a loss. The author tried to be supportive but refused the church request. The girlfriend was upset because maybe the tradition mattered to her emotionally, even if she's not religious. Did the author fail to support her in a time of grief?\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't religious and has a right to stick to their beliefs. On the other hand, maybe the girlfriend needed the tradition as a comfort. The author might not have considered that going to church was important for her emotionally, beyond just religious belief. The fight might have been about her needing support in a specific way. So, is the author in the wrong for not accommodating her emotional needs, even if the reason is tied to tradition and loss?\n\nBut wait, the author did say they wanted to be there for her until she asked for church. Maybe they didn't realize that the request was about emotional support rather than religion. If the author had gone, even if not believing, it could show support. However, the author also has the right to their beliefs. But in a relationship, sometimes compromise is needed. The girlfriend might have felt that the author wasn't supporting her through her grief by not honoring her tradition. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional significance, even if it's tied to religion. Or maybe not, because the author is honest about their beliefs. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The answer could go either way. But in AITA scenarios, often the person is considered wrong if they didn't consider their partner's feelings enough. The author might have been rigid in their stance and not flexible enough in supporting their partner during a tough time. So maybe the answer is A. But if the author didn't think the tradition was important because the girlfriend isn't religious, maybe they're not wrong. Wait, the girlfriend said she doesn't want to go, but asked the author to go anyway. Maybe she wanted the author to go with her for emotional support, not because she believes in it. The author's refusal might have been a failure to support her in her way of grieving. That would make the author wrong. So answer A. But others might say it's B. I'm leaning towards A because the author didn't accommodate an emotional need, even if it's tied to tradition. So answer A.\n"
