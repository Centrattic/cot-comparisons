I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending church with their girlfriend after her dad's death. The key points here are the religious context, the girlfriend's family traditions, and the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author isn't religious and their girlfriend isn't either, except for occasional times like Christmas and Easter. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and she used to go with them. Now, after her father's death, she asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend was upset, leading to a fight about traditions.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, supporting a partner during a time of grief and honoring family traditions can be important. Church might be a significant tradition for her family, and attending could be a way to show support and respect. However, the author's refusal is based on personal beliefs and a lack of interest in the service. The girlfriend even said she didn't really want to go, which complicates the issue because if she's not committed to attending either, maybe the push for the author to go was more about tradition or her own feelings of obligation rather than a genuine desire.\n\nThe author did mention being there for her in other ways, which suggests they are supportive. The conflict arose from a specific request that the author felt conflicted about. It's also worth considering that in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's beliefs and boundaries. However, sometimes making exceptions for each other's important traditions can be a part of a healthy relationship.\n\nBut since the girlfriend herself isn't particularly religious anymore and the author is clear about their stance, maybe the expectation was unrealistic. The author might not be in the wrong for not bending their beliefs, especially if the girlfriend was conflicted about attending herself. It's a balance between respecting each other's values and understanding the importance of certain traditions in a partner's life. However, the author's lack of willingness to make an effort for something that might be meaningful to her family and her could also be seen as a failure to support her during a difficult time. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't entirely wrong for standing by their beliefs, there might be room for empathy and understanding the significance of the tradition to the girlfriend and her family. But since the girlfriend wasn't sure about going either, the author's refusal might be seen as not fully supporting her in her own way. The answer could be nuanced, but based on the given information, the author's refusal is a personal choice, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
