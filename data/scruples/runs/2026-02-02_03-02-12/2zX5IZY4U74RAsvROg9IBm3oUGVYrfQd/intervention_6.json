I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the key points: Neither the author nor his girlfriend are very religious. She attends church occasionally, mainly for holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's been trying to cope. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter, which is a tradition for her family. He refused, citing his lack of belief and not wanting to sit through the service. It led to a fight, and she's upset.\n\nThe author is unsure if he's wrong for not complying. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the girlfriend might be seeking emotional support from her partner during a difficult time. Church could be a significant tradition for her, especially after her father's death. Even if she's not religious, the tradition might hold personal meaning. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in her time of need.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has his own beliefs and isn't religious. He's honest about his stance, and the girlfriend even admitted she doesn't want to go. So maybe she's conflicted about the tradition herself. The author might feel that going against his beliefs isn't fair to himself. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not bending.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction (huge fight, crying, sulking) suggests she felt hurt or unsupported. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up for her might be a way to show support beyond his own beliefs. But if she's ambivalent, maybe the author isn't wrong for not going. It's a balance between respecting her feelings and his own principles.\n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether supporting a partner's emotional needs (even if it's a tradition) is more important than adhering to personal beliefs. There's no clear right or wrong, but the author's refusal might be seen as not fully supporting her, hence why some might say he's in the wrong. However, others might argue that he's being honest and not compromising his beliefs when she's also uncertain.\n"
