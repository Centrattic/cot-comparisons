I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple isn't very religious. The girlfriend goes to church sometimes, mostly on big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad recently passed away, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to Easter church with her because it was a tradition they did every year. He refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight, and she's upset now. He's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the girlfriend's emotional state after her father's death, the cultural/religous traditions, and the conflict between his beliefs and her needs. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, supporting a partner during a loss is important. Even if he isn't religious, maybe attending a service could help her grieve. But he also has his own beliefs and boundaries. The argument here is about whether respecting her traditions and emotional needs takes precedence over his personal beliefs.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because he didn't support her during a tough time. If it's B (no), it's because he stayed true to his beliefs and she agreed not to go, but there's a conflict in expectations.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, attending church might be a way for her to honor her father and find comfort. Refusing could make her feel unsupported. On the other hand, he's honest about his beliefs and she initially said she didn't want to go either. The fight might be about deeper issues of compromise in the relationship.\n\nBut since she's grieving and he's supposed to be supportive, maybe not attending without trying to understand her perspective is the problem. Even if he's not religious, showing up might be symbolic support. However, if she's not keen on it, maybe there's another way. The answer could hinge on communication and compromise.\n\nHe didn't want to attend, but she felt it was important. Even if she later said she didn't want to go, maybe the fact that she asked shows it's significant. The conflict arose from not meeting her emotional needs. So maybe he's at fault for not being flexible. But he's also right to express his beliefs. The answer might be A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the answer is B, it's because he's honest and she's not actually religious, but the situation is more about her coping mechanisms.\n"
