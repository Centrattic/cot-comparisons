I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor their girlfriend are very religious. The author isn't religious at all, and the girlfriend only goes occasionally, like for Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, though.\n\nHer dad died a few months ago, and she's dealing with her grief. The author supports her but when she asked him to go to church with her on Easter, he refused. He gives two reasons: he doesn't want to sit through the whole service and he doesn't believe in the religion. He also points out that she isn't really religious either. This led to a big fight about traditions, and she's upset now. The author is conflicted but doesn't see the point of going.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nHmm. To determine if the author is wrong, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and she had a tradition of going to church on Easter with them. Now that she can't fly home, she asked the author to go with her. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her emotional needs or her family's traditions, especially during a time of grief. Even though the author isn't religious, supporting the girlfriend in her way might matter more here. The girlfriend might see the church as a place of comfort or a way to honor her father's memory, even if she's not that religious. The author's argument is that she doesn't really want to go, but maybe she still needs the experience for emotional closure or to connect with her family. The author's refusal could be perceived as not being considerate of her emotional state, even if he's sincere about his beliefs. On the other hand, the author is honest about his beliefs and isn't forcing himself to participate. It's a balance between respecting personal beliefs and supporting a partner's emotional needs. The answer might depend on cultural context and the importance placed on traditions in their relationship. But given that the girlfriend is upset and the author's refusal led to conflict, it's possible he is in the wrong for not accommodating her emotional needs, even if his reasons are valid.\n"
