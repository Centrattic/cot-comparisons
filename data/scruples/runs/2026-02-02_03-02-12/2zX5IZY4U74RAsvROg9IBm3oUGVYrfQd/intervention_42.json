I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author mentions they're not religious, and the girlfriend is only somewhat religious, attending mainly for Christmas and Easter. Her family is very religious, though, and she used to go with them. Now, after her dad's death, she wanted to go to church on Easter, but the author refused, leading to a fight.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is wrong. First, the key points here are the girlfriend's emotional state after her father's death and her request for support through attending church. The author's reasoning is that they don't believe in religion and don't want to sit through a service. However, the girlfriend's desire might be more about tradition and coping than the religion itself. \n\nThe author says the girlfriend even mentioned she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. If she's not committed to going, maybe the author's refusal isn't the issue. But the context is her grieving, and she might need emotional support from her partner in a way that's meaningful to her. The author's refusal could be seen as not providing that support, even if it's not a religious act for him.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author isn't in a position to pretend to believe or participate in something they don't. There's a balance between respecting a partner's needs and staying true to oneself. The girlfriend might be using religion as a way to process grief, and the author's refusal might not be the main problem if they're otherwise supportive. However, the act of attending church could be a significant gesture of support during a difficult time, even if it's not religious for the author. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author is willing to make a small effort to be present for their partner's emotional needs, even if the activity isn't meaningful to them. If the author is not willing, even as a gesture of support, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the author feels they can't fake participation, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The question is about whether refusing to attend is inherently wrong, considering their lack of religious belief and the girlfriend's mixed feelings. \n\nHmm. I think the answer could be either way. But given the girlfriend is in a vulnerable state and the author's refusal might be perceived as not supporting her through her grief, even if it's not a religious act, the author might be in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
