I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The main points are that they're both not very religious, but her family is. She asked him to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition for her family, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. Now they're fighting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's dad just died, so this might be a sensitive time for her. Even though she's not super religious now, the tradition of going to church with her family on Easter was something she did before. The fact that she's trying to cope with her father's death might make this request more about emotional support than the religion itself. She might need him to be there for moral support, not necessarily to participate in the service.\n\nThe author says that he doesn't believe in the religion and doesn't want to sit through the service. But maybe she wanted him to be there to show solidarity, even if he didn't participate. The fact that she said she doesn't really want to go might mean she's conflicted about the tradition but feels pressured by her family. However, she might still need some form of presence from her partner during this time.\n\nThe key here is about being supportive in a relationship. Even if you don't share the same beliefs, showing up for your partner during a difficult time can be important. The author's refusal could be seen as not being supportive, especially since the girlfriend is struggling with her grief. The argument here is about whether respecting her emotional needs is more important than sticking to personal beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that his own beliefs are valid and that he shouldn't have to pretend to believe in something he doesn't. But in a relationship, compromise is often necessary. The question is whether this situation requires that compromise. Since the girlfriend was asking for his presence, even if it's just symbolic, not showing up might have been perceived as not being there for her when she needed support.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because not going could be seen as not supporting her emotional needs during a difficult time, even if it's a religious event.\n"
