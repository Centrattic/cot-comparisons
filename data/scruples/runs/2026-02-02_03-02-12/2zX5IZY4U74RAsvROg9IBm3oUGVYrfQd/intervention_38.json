I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. Both aren't very religious, but her family is, and she went to church occasionally. The girl's family wanted her to attend church on Easter as a tradition, especially after her father's death, and she asked him to go with her. He refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. The fight happened because she wanted to honor her family's traditions, and he felt it wasn't necessary since she wasn't really religious. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key factors are mutual respect in a relationship, the importance of traditions, and personal beliefs. The author is being honest about his beliefs and doesn't feel the need to participate. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the gesture is important for her emotional support or family expectations. The fact that she went to church with her family every Easter before suggests it's a significant tradition. However, she also said she doesn't really want to go now, which complicates things. Maybe she's conflicted between her own feelings and her family's expectations.\n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as not supporting his girlfriend, but he did state that he's been there for her otherwise. The problem might be communication. If he had offered an alternative way to support her, like attending a different event or being there afterward, maybe it would have been better. But from his perspective, he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his beliefs. However, in relationships, sometimes showing support through actions, even if you don't personally believe in them, is important. So there's a balance between respecting each other's beliefs and supporting each other's needs. It's a tough call, but I think the author isn't wrong, but he could have handled it more sensitively. The answer is B.\n"
