I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: Neither the author nor his girlfriend is very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she attended church with them on major holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her father recently died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with the author. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend felt hurt and it led to a fight.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to not attend. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend might be seeking emotional support during a difficult time. Attending church could be a tradition for her family, and she might have wanted the author to show solidarity, even if he doesn't believe in the religion. The author could be seen as not respecting her family's traditions and her emotional needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his beliefs and isn't religious. The girlfriend herself mentioned she doesn't really want to go, so maybe her request was more about wanting to be with him than the actual church service. The author might feel that forcing himself to go against his will isn't genuine support.\n\nBut wait, even if the girlfriend isn't super religious, the act of attending church could be a way for her to honor her family's wishes or her father's memory. The author not going might be perceived as not supporting her through this time. The girlfriend's emotional reaction (crying and sulking) suggests that she felt the author wasn't there for her when she needed him.\n\nHowever, the author did mention being there for her in other ways. The issue here is the specific request for church attendance. The author might not see the value in it, but the girlfriend did. There's a balance between respecting each other's beliefs and traditions and supporting the partner emotionally.\n\nIn relationships, sometimes one has to make compromises, especially in significant times like after a loss. The author's refusal might be seen as a lack of willingness to meet her halfway, even if it's not a religious act for him. But if the girlfriend truly isn't compelled to go either, the author's stance might be more about his own discomfort rather than her needs.\n\nI think the crux is whether the author's refusal was based on genuine support for the girlfriend's emotional needs or his own beliefs. Since the girlfriend was conflicted but still wanted him to go, the author's refusal might not fully consider her emotional state. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not attending, even if it's not the usual thing for him.\n"
