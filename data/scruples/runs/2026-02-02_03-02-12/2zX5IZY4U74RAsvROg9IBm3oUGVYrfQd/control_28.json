I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that they're both not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad died a few months ago, and she wanted to go to church on Easter. The author refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. The girlfriend is upset, crying, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she's part of that family. Even though she's not super religious, maybe going to church is a way for her to honor her dad or find some comfort. The author is being honest about his beliefs, but maybe not considering her emotional needs here. The question is about whether he's wrong for not compromising.\n\nThe author says he feels bad but doesn't see the point. The girlfriend even said she doesn't really want to go, which might be confusing. Maybe she wanted to go for closure or tradition, even if she's not religious. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her through her grief, even if it's a religious act. Relationships often require compromise, so maybe the author should have tried to support her in this, even if it's not his belief system.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is also honest about his beliefs. Should he have to pretend to believe in something he doesn't? It's a balance between respecting one's own beliefs and supporting a partner's needs. If the girlfriend is conflicted and wants to go, even if she's not into it, maybe the author should have gone with her to show support. The fact that they had a big fight and she's upset suggests that the author's refusal was hurtful, even if he's being truthful.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because in a relationship, supporting each other through difficult times, even if it's not one's own tradition, is important. The author could have compromised or at least tried to understand her perspective better. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up for her might be more important than sticking to his own stance in this situation.\n"
