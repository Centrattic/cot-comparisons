I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend's father died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with the author. The author refused because he's not religious and doesn't believe in it. The girlfriend is upset because of family traditions, but the author feels it's not necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author isn't religious, and the girlfriend isn't either except for some holidays. The family is religious, so maybe there's pressure from her side. But the author is being honest about his beliefs. However, the girlfriend is grieving, and maybe she wanted that ritual for comfort. The author said they don't need to go since she's not that religious now. But she might still value the tradition for emotional reasons.\n\nThe key here is about supporting a partner during grief. Even if the author doesn't believe, showing up might be a way to support her. He said he doesn't want to sit through the entire service, which could be seen as not making an effort. But he's also being truthful about his beliefs. The girlfriend is upset, so maybe the author should have compromised. But if he really can't go, maybe it's not his fault. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say he should have gone to support her, others might say it's okay to stick to his beliefs. The answer might depend on cultural context and the relationship dynamics. Since the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
