I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor their girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church when her family wanted her to. Now, after her dad's death, she asked the author to go to Easter church with her. The author refused because they don't believe in it and don't want to sit through the service. They argued, and the girlfriend is upset. The author feels bad but doesn't see the point of going, especially since the girlfriend also said she doesn't really want to go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't religious and has communicated that. The girlfriend is somewhat religious, at least for holidays, but now is dealing with grief. The request to go to church might be more about emotional support than religious reasons. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting their girlfriend during a hard time. But the author is also being honest about their beliefs and preferences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's family is religious, so maybe she's under pressure to maintain traditions. The author might not understand the emotional significance. But the author did say they want to be there for her, so maybe they thought other ways of support. The key points are about support and respecting each other's boundaries. The author is not forcing the girlfriend, but the girlfriend might feel the author isn't respecting her needs. It's a balancing act between personal beliefs and partner's emotional needs. The answer could go either way, but if the author is honest and doesn't force the girlfriend, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, supporting through traditions might be important. Hmm. I think the answer depends on whether the action (not going) is considered a breach of support. Since the author is non-religious and honest, they aren't in the wrong, but it's a sensitive situation. So answer B.\n"
