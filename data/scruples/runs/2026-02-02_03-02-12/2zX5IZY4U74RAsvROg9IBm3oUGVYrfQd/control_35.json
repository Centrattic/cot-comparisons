I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that both are not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them. Now, after her dad's death, she asked him to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. They fought, and she's upset. He's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is not religious and doesn't believe in the practices. The girlfriend isn't super religious either but has family traditions. She asked him to go with her, but he said no. He argues that she doesn't really want to go, so why should he? But she might be using the church as a way to cope with her grief and honor her tradition, even if she's not super into it now.\n\nThe question is about whether his refusal is wrong. In relationships, mutual respect and support are important. Even if the author isn't religious, showing support for his partner's emotional needs might be expected. The girlfriend is dealing with the loss of her father, so the church visit might be significant for her as a way to grieve or find comfort. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time, even if his beliefs don't align with the activity. \n\nHowever, the author is honest about his beliefs and doesn't want to pretend. But the girlfriend might have felt that his refusal was dismissive of her feelings or her family's traditions. The key here is whether the author is respecting her emotional needs versus his own beliefs. If the church visit was important to her for closure or support, then not going might be seen as not being there for her. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because in a relationship, sometimes you need to make compromises for each other's emotional well-being, especially during tough times. Even if it's not his tradition, showing up for her could be a gesture of support. The fact that she's upset and crying suggests it's hurtful to her, which might mean he didn't fully consider the emotional impact. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
