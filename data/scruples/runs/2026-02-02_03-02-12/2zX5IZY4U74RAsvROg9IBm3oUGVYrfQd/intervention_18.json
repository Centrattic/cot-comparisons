I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that they're not very religious, and her family is more so. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which she had done every year with her family, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. They ended up fighting, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't religious, and his girlfriend isn't either, except for holidays. Her family is religious, and she had gone with them before. Now, after her dad's death, she's trying to maintain some traditions, but he's unwilling to comply. He says she even told him she doesn't want to go, but he still refused. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From one angle, it's about respecting her wishes and her family's traditions, especially during a time of grief. Even if he doesn't share her beliefs, supporting her through this might be important. On the other hand, he's being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to attend. But maybe he didn't consider that she might need this for her healing, even if she's not fully religious now.\n\nAlso, he said they don't need to go because she's not that religious. But she asked him to go, which suggests she still wanted to honor the tradition, maybe for her family's sake or her own. His refusal might have been seen as not supporting her during a difficult time. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up could be a gesture of support.\n\nHe mentions she's crying and sulking, which indicates the emotional impact. Maybe communication was an issue. He could have tried to find a compromise, like attending a shorter service or another way to show support without full participation. But he refused outright, which might have been hurtful.\n\nHowever, he's also honest about his beliefs. But in relationships, compromise is often necessary. The fact that she's trying to handle her grief and he's not budging might mean he's not considering her emotional needs. So maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't support her during a tough time, even if it's not his belief system. The answer might be A, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if he's being truthful about his beliefs and she's aware of that, maybe it's not wrong. But the key is that she needed this for her healing, and he didn't support her. So perhaps A is correct.\n"
