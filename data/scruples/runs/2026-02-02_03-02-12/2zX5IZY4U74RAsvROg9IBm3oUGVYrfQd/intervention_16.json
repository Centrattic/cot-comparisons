I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking whether they're at fault for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They don't consider themselves religious, and their girlfriend isn't either but sometimes goes for holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now, during Easter, she asked him to join her, which he refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight about traditions, and she's upset.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the question is whether they are. So, the key points here: the girlfriend's emotional needs after her father's death versus the author's personal beliefs. The author is being asked to participate in a tradition that's important to her family, even if he doesn't share the religious views. But he refused, which made her upset. \n\nI need to consider if respecting her wishes, even if it's a religious activity, is part of being supportive in a relationship. Maybe the issue isn't about the author's personal beliefs per se, but about not being considerate of her emotional state. If she wanted to go to church for comfort or to honor her dad, even if he doesn't believe, maybe the act of being there for her is more important. But the author argues she said she doesn't really want to go. Wait, the girlfriend actually said she doesn't really want to go, so why did she ask him? Maybe she's conflicted or wanted to maintain family traditions despite her own feelings. \n\nSo the author might not be in the wrong if the girlfriend isn't even keen on attending, but the problem is that the request came up and he refused, leading to a fight. The author's stance is about their own beliefs and not wanting to sit through a service. However, in a relationship, sometimes you have to compromise for the other person's emotional needs. If the girlfriend felt like going to church was a way to cope, but the author refused, that could be seen as not being supportive. But if she's ambivalent, maybe the author is right to say no. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The girlfriend might be using the tradition as a way to process her grief, even if she's not religious. The author's response of saying they don't need to go because she's not that religious might dismiss her emotional needs. So even if the author has valid reasons, the way he responded could be the issue. The fact that she's upset and it turned into a fight suggests that his refusal was hurtful. \n\nHowever, the user's point is that the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend might be using the church visit as a way to connect with her family or find closure, and the author's refusal might have made her feel unsupported. On the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs. The answer depends on whether supporting a partner's emotional needs takes precedence over personal beliefs in this context. \n\nI think there's a middle ground. The author could have gone if it was meaningful to her, even if he doesn't believe, as a gesture of support. But since she says she doesn't want to go, maybe he's justified. Wait, the user said she can't fly home for Easter and asked him to go instead. Maybe she wanted to maintain the tradition in some way, even if he's not religious. If she's not all that religious, but the act of going is about tradition or family, the author might be in a position where his refusal is seen as not respecting her family's wishes. \n\nBut the author's argument is that they don't need to go because she's not religious. If she's ambivalent, maybe the author is right. However, the girlfriend's emotional state post-loss might require her to hold onto some traditions for comfort. The author's refusal might be missing that emotional support aspect. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (in the wrong) because he didn't support her in a time of need, even if it's a religious activity. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's honest about his beliefs. The key is whether the request was for emotional support rather than religious observance. If the author refused despite her not being religious, but she still wanted to go for other reasons, then he's in the wrong. If she's not really into it, then he's not. \n\nThe user's own thought is that the author isn't wrong. But some might argue that being supportive in a partner's time of grief is more important than personal beliefs. The fight suggests that communication was an issue. Maybe the author could have gone if it was significant to her, even if he didn't participate fully. But since she admitted she doesn't want to go, maybe he's justified. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the author is not in the wrong because he's being honest and the girlfriend's own lack of interest is a factor here. So answer B.\n"
