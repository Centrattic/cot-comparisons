I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The question is whether refusing to attend church was wrong.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that neither he nor his girlfriend is very religious. The girlfriend goes to church occasionally, like on Christmas and Easter, mainly because her family is religious. She used to go more often when her family wanted her to. Now, her dad has died, and she asked him to go to church with her on Easter. He declined because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. He also pointed out that she's not that religious anymore, leading to a big fight about traditions.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respect for traditions, emotional support, and personal beliefs. The key issue is whether the author was wrong to not attend church with her.\n\nOn one hand, the author's position is that he doesn't want to pretend to be religious or attend a service he doesn't believe in. He might feel that it's not genuine to go just for the sake of the tradition. Also, the girlfriend herself seems ambivalent, saying she doesn't really want to go. If that's the case, maybe the author is right in thinking she doesn't need the tradition as much as her family does.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that this is an important time for her, especially after her father's death. Even if she's not super religious, the tradition could be a way for her to cope or honor her father. The author's refusal might be perceived as not supporting her during a difficult time, which could hurt her feelings. Even if the author is being genuine in his beliefs, emotional support in a relationship often involves making compromises, especially around significant family matters.\n\nThe fact that they had a big fight suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her. The author might not realize how important this tradition is to her, even if she's not religious. People can find comfort in rituals, especially during grief. So, maybe the author could have considered her emotional needs over his own discomfort.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't religious and might not see the point in attending. If the girlfriend isn't pushing for it and seems ambivalent, maybe she's not expecting a religious service but more of a support presence. However, the author's refusal could have been handled more sensitively. Perhaps he could have gone and just sat through it, even if he didn't believe, as a gesture of support. That way, he shows he's there for her, even if he doesn't share her beliefs.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. Even if the author doesn't believe in church, attending could be a small sacrifice to support his partner during a tough time. The fact that she's crying and sulking indicates that his refusal was hurtful. Maybe he could have found a middle ground, like attending part of the service or finding another way to show support that aligns with their lack of religious beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's beliefs are valid, the situation might require him to prioritize emotional support for his girlfriend, even if it means attending a service he's not comfortable with. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because refusing to attend could be seen as not supporting his partner during her time of need, even if the tradition isn't meaningful to him.\n"
