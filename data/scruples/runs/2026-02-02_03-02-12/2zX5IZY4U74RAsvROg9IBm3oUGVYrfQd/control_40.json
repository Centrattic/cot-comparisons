I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious. The girl's family is religious and they went to church for big holidays before. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to Easter church with him. He said no because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through it. Now she's upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting her feelings and traditions. Even if they're not religious, maybe she wanted to go for her dad's memory. He said she doesn't really want to go, but maybe she does because it's a tradition or for closure. The fight is about traditions and support.\n\nThe author is being honest about his beliefs, but maybe not considering her emotional needs. Supporting someone in grief isn't just about doing what you want. If she asked him to go, maybe it was important to her. He should have tried to accommodate, even if he's not religious. So maybe he's in the wrong. But he's also not forcing her to believe. It's a balance between personal beliefs and partner's needs. The answer might be A (wrong) because he didn't support her in her time of need, even if it's about something he doesn't personally believe in.\n"
