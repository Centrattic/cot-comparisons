I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple isn't very religious. The man isn't religious at all, and the woman goes to church occasionally, mainly for big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is very religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Now, her dad died recently, and she wanted to go to church on Easter. He refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. They had a big fight about it, and she's upset.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for refusing. Let's consider the key points. The woman is dealing with grief after her father's death. Church might be important to her for emotional support or tradition. Even though she's not super religious, the fact that her family has always done this and she went with them before might mean it's a significant tradition for her. She even goes on Easter despite not being religious, maybe to honor her family's customs.\n\nHe says he wants to be there for her but refused when asked. He argues that since she's not that religious, they don't need to go. However, she might feel that in this time of grief, going to church is a way to connect with her family's traditions or find comfort. His refusal might make her feel unsupported, especially if she's trying to navigate her grief and her family's expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his beliefs and not pretending to be something he's not. He might feel that forcing himself to go would be insincere. But in relationships, especially during tough times, sometimes compromising is necessary. The fact that they had a big fight over it suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings, even if he thinks he's right.\n\nSo, the main conflict is between his right to his beliefs and her need for emotional support. It's a balance between respecting each other's values. While he's not wrong for not wanting to attend, he might have failed to consider how important this was to her during her grieving process. Supporting her through her grief could involve participating in traditions she finds meaningful, even if they don't align with his beliefs. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being flexible in this situation.\n"
