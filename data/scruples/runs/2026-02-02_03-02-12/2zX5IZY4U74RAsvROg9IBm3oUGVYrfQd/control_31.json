I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend's dad recently died. The girlfriend is not very religious but her family is. She asked her boyfriend to go to church with her on Easter, which is a tradition for her family. The author (the boyfriend) refuses because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight about it, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The boyfriend isn't religious at all, and the girlfriend is only somewhat religious, going for big holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now that her dad passed away, maybe she's trying to hold on to traditions as a way to cope. She asked him to go with her, but he declined, and it caused a conflict.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for not going. On one hand, he's honest about his beliefs and doesn't want to pretend. Respect for each other's beliefs is important in a relationship. But on the other hand, supporting someone through grief and respecting their family traditions could be seen as important too. She might be looking for emotional support, even if the tradition isn't something she personally believes in anymore.\n\nBut the girlfriend also said she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. If she's ambivalent, why did she ask him to go? Maybe she wanted to honor her dad's memory or her family's expectations. The boyfriend's refusal might hurt her feelings because she feels unsupported. However, he did offer to be there for her in other ways. The problem is that his refusal to go to church might be seen as dismissing her needs during a difficult time.\n\nBut then again, if she's not really religious and doesn't want to go, maybe she's conflicted. It's possible she wanted to go for her dad's memory, not necessarily for religion. The boyfriend's refusal to participate in a tradition that she's connected to could be seen as not being supportive. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up might have been a way to show solidarity.\n\nHowever, he did say he's there for her, but refused this specific request. The issue is communication. Maybe they need to talk about how to support each other without forcing each other to do things they don't believe in. But the fight suggests that the refusal was hurtful. So, is he wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If she's not religious but still wanted to go for her family's sake, refusing might not be wrong. But if she needed his support in that moment, not going could be seen as not being supportive. The fact that she's upset and it turned into a big fight indicates that he might have hurt her feelings. So maybe he's in the wrong for not considering her emotional needs as much as his own beliefs.\n"
