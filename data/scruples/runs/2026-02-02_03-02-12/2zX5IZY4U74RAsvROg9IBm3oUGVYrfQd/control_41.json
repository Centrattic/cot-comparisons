I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend's father died a few months ago, and her family is religious. The girlfriend asked the author to go to church with her on Easter because it's a tradition they always did. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight, and the author is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is not religious and doesn't want to attend a service he doesn't believe in. On the other hand, the girlfriend's family has strong traditions, and this might be important for her emotionally after her father's death. She might have wanted to honor her father or find comfort in the tradition, even if she's not as religious as her family. \n\nThe author says that he's supportive, but refuses to attend church. The girlfriend was trying to handle her grief and perhaps found solace in traditions. By refusing to go, the author might be seen as not supporting her in a way that's meaningful to her. Even if he's not religious, sometimes in relationships, partners make compromises for each other's emotional needs. \n\nBut then again, the author is also within his rights to not attend a religious service he doesn't believe in. He's not forcing her to go either, he's just not accompanying her. However, the act of going together might have been a gesture of support beyond just words. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't respecting her family's traditions or her emotional needs during a difficult time.\n\nI should also think about the context. The author's girlfriend is not very religious herself, but her family is. Maybe she wanted to connect with her roots or find some comfort. The fact that she even considered going to church despite not being religious shows that it's important to her. The author might not realize how significant this tradition is to her, especially after her father's death. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting one's own beliefs and supporting a partner in their emotional needs. The author might have failed to recognize that attending the service could be a way for her to cope, even if he doesn't understand it. However, forcing oneself to attend something one doesn't believe in can also be uncomfortable. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's refusal, the girlfriend's emotional state, the importance of traditions in her family, and the need for mutual support in a relationship. The author may have been wrong in not considering how important this gesture could be for her, even if he personally doesn't connect with the tradition. Support in a relationship sometimes means doing things that are meaningful to your partner, even if they don't personally resonate with you. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't forcing her to not go, his refusal to attend might have hurt her feelings and not shown enough support. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
