I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nSo the situation is that they're not very religious. The girl goes to church sometimes, like Christmas and Easter, but her family is religious. Her dad just died, and she wanted him to go to church with her on Easter. He refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. He told her they don't need to go since she's not that religious. It led to a fight about traditions, and she's upset now. He feels bad but doesn't see the point.\n\nHmm. Well, the key points here are about respecting partner's wishes and cultural/religious traditions, especially during a time of grief. The girl might be seeking comfort in traditions after her father's death. Even though she's not super religious, the family's traditions might be important to her emotionally. By not going, the author might be dismissing her emotional needs, even if he doesn't share the beliefs. \n\nBut he did say he's there for her otherwise. The conflict is about whether he should compromise his own beliefs to support her. However, in relationships, sometimes compromise is necessary. Even if you don't believe, showing up for her could be a way to support her during a tough time. The fact that she asked and he refused might make her feel unsupported. \n\nBut he also argued that she doesn't really want to go. However, maybe she wanted to go for her family's sake or her own coping. The author's refusal might be seen as not respecting her needs. \n\nSo, considering the context of her father's death and the emotional weight, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because supporting her through this period is important, even if it involves participating in traditions he isn't comfortable with. But there's also the argument about personal beliefs. However, in relationships, showing up for each other often requires some compromise, especially during grief. So I think the answer is A.\n"
