I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them on big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her dad passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with the author. He refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight about traditions.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know my take. So, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: he's not religious and doesn't want to pretend or go through a service he doesn't believe in. He tried to explain that. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she's trying to connect with her family's traditions, maybe as a way to cope with her dad's death. Even though she says she's not very religious, the tradition is important to her in this context. The author might not realize that going to church isn't just about religion for her, but about family and dealing with grief.\n\nBut then again, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not forcing himself to participate. The girlfriend might need to express her grief in a way he doesn't support. Is it wrong to not support that? Maybe the author could have found another way to be present, like being there after the service or showing support in a different manner. However, the author didn't want to go at all. Maybe the issue is about understanding her needs beyond his own beliefs. If he's there for her in other ways, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But refusing to go to church might have been a mistake because it's a significant tradition for her family during a tough time. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe partially, because it's about her emotional needs rather than religion. So answer A? Or B?\n"
