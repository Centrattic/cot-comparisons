I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her father's death. \n\nFirst, the context: Both are not very religious. The girlfriend goes to church occasionally, especially for major holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her father died recently, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, but the author refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to participate.\n\nThe key points here are about supporting a partner during a difficult time. Even if the author isn't religious, his girlfriend might find comfort in these traditions. She mentioned she can't fly home, so going to church is probably important to her as a way to honor her father and cope with grief. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her emotional needs, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. \n\nThe author says she even told him she doesn't really want to go, but that might be a misunderstanding. She could be trying to honor her family's traditions or find solace in the ritual despite her own lack of religiosity. His response of dismissing the importance of the tradition might have hurt her feelings, leading to the argument.\n\nSupporting someone through grief sometimes requires doing things that aren't personally meaningful to you. The fact that she's been trying to cope and reached out to him shows she values his support. Refusing might be perceived as a lack of empathy, even if the author's intention was to respect her lack of religiosity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to pretend to believe in something he doesn't. However, in a relationship, meeting each other halfway is often necessary. There might be a middle ground, like attending part of the service or finding another way to support her. But by flatly refusing, he might have ignored her emotional needs during a time when she needed support the most.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's emotional state and the importance of traditions in her grieving process, the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate, even if his reasons are valid. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
