I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend asked him to go to church with her on Easter after her dad died, but he refused. He's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go a lot, but now she's not really into it. They had a big fight about traditions, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't religious and has made that clear. The girlfriend isn't super religious either, but her family is, and she's part of their tradition. The key point is that the girlfriend asked him to go to church, not because she believes in it, but maybe because it's a tradition she wants to maintain for family reasons. The author said no, which might have felt like a rejection to her. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, supporting a partner during grief is important. If she wanted to go to church as a way to cope or honor her dad's memory, even if it's a tradition, maybe he should have tried to accommodate. On the other hand, he's not religious and might not feel comfortable pretending to be. It's about respecting his beliefs versus her emotional needs.\n\nBut the author said that she \"can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church.\" Maybe she wanted to maintain the tradition with someone, especially since she can't be with her family. If the author is her partner, she might expect him to be present for such a significant time, even if it's just to support her. However, the author also mentioned that she said she doesn't really want to go now. So maybe she's conflicted too. \n\nI need to think about boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with the religious aspect, is there a compromise? Like attending for a short time, or finding another way to support her. But the author refused entirely. The girlfriend might feel that he isn't respecting her family's practices or her feelings during this time. But the author might feel that he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his beliefs and the fact that he doesn't want to go. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is often key. If the author is willing to attend for the sake of his partner, even if he's not religious, maybe that's expected. But if he's unwilling, perhaps he's in the wrong. However, the girlfriend might have known his stance on religion before this, so maybe she shouldn't have expected him to go. The fight seems to be about traditions, but the author isn't part of that tradition. \n\nAnother angle: the author is not forcing her to go; she's the one who asked. If he's honest and she's still upset, maybe it's more about her needing to maintain the tradition for herself or her family, and his refusal is making her feel unsupported. But if she truly doesn't want to go, then maybe his refusal isn't wrong. \n\nHmm, but the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to check if there's a cultural or social expectation here. In some families, attending church after a loss is a way to find comfort, so the author might be seen as not being there for her during a tough time. However, the author might have boundaries about participating in things he doesn't believe in. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the refusal was disrespectful. The author did offer to go if needed, but then refused. Maybe he should have found a middle ground. But if he's clear about his beliefs and she's still upset, it's a conflict of expectations. The author isn't in the wrong if he's been upfront and they both knew each other's positions. But if she genuinely wanted to attend and he didn't try to support in another way, maybe he is. \n\nWait, the author said he told her \"we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious.\" That might come off as dismissive of her feelings. Maybe even if the author isn't religious, he could have acknowledged her desire to attend for family reasons or her dad's memory. The fight might have been caused by the author's comment downplaying the importance of the tradition. \n\nSo, the author's response could be seen as not respecting her emotional needs. Even if they aren't religious, attending a service might be a meaningful way to show support. But if the author is firm in his stance and the girlfriend is in her own grieving process, it's a tough spot. \n\nIn the end, it's about mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for not going, but might have handled it poorly. The answer might be B, but there's nuance. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the girlfriend's emotional state and possible needs, maybe the answer is A. However, if the author is being honest and the girlfriend is overreacting, then B. It's tricky, but I think the author's refusal without trying to find a solution might be seen as not supportive enough. So maybe A.\n"
