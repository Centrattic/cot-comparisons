I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. Both aren't very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which she's done every year, but he refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. They argued, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she's trying to connect with her roots or find comfort after her father's death. Even though she's not very religious now, the tradition might mean a lot to her. The author's refusal could be seen as dismissive of her needs during a difficult time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't religious and might feel that going to church isn't genuine for him. He did say he's there for her, but maybe not in the way she needed. The problem is that he didn't go even though she asked, and he dismissed the importance of the tradition. \n\nThe user might be looking for a balance between respecting personal beliefs and supporting a partner's emotional needs. Even if he doesn't believe, attending church might not be about belief but about supporting her. The author's refusal could be seen as not being supportive enough. But he did mention he doesn't want to go, which is his right. However, in a relationship, sometimes compromise is necessary, especially during grieving. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the girlfriend needed that emotional support and he didn't provide it in the way she wanted, maybe he is. But if he's honest and they've discussed it, maybe not. The fact that she's upset and it turned into a big fight suggests that his refusal hurt her. Even if he's not religious, showing up to support her might have been more considerate. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her emotional need for tradition and support during her time of grief, even if his reasons are valid. Relationships often require compromise on non-religious matters to support each other's emotional well-being.\n"
