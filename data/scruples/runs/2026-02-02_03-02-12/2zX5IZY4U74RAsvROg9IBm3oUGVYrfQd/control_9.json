I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor the girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and they went to church often. Her dad passed away a few months ago, and she asked him to go to church with her on Easter because that's what they did every year. He declined because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, and now they're arguing about traditions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is that he's not religious and doesn't see the point of going to church, especially since the girlfriend isn't that religious either. He argues that since she's not into it, they don't need to go. But the girlfriend might feel that this is an important tradition, especially given the recent loss of her father. Even if she's not super religious, the tradition might hold emotional significance for her family and her healing process.\n\nThe key factors here are respect for each other's beliefs and the emotional weight of traditions. The author might be right in staying true to his beliefs, but he might also be missing the emotional aspect for the girlfriend. The girlfriend's request could be about supporting her in her grief, not just following religious practices. The fact that she's upset and crying suggests that her feelings were hurt, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nHowever, the author did say he's there for her in other ways. But attending church could be a way to show support for her in a time of loss, even if it's not something he personally believes in. The girlfriend might have wanted to honor her father's memory through that tradition, and not going might make her feel unsupported. So, even if the author isn't in the wrong morally, he might have failed to consider her emotional needs in the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to his beliefs. But in a relationship, especially when there's a significant event like a parent's death, sometimes compromise is necessary. The question is whether refusing to participate in a meaningful tradition is inconsiderate, even if it's not religious for him. Since the girlfriend is trying to cope, the author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her through her grief, which is more about emotional support than religion.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author isn't religious, the act of attending church here might be more about supporting his girlfriend and respecting her family's traditions during a sensitive time. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't accommodate her emotional needs, even if it's not his personal belief.\n"
