I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author isn't religious and their girlfriend is only somewhat religious, going during big holidays. The family is very religious though. The girlfriend's dad died, and she asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, which she used to do every year. The author declined because they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service, and they both aren't very religious. The girlfriend is upset, and the author is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the girlfriend's emotional state after her father's death, the cultural or family traditions, and the author's personal beliefs. The author says the girlfriend isn't really religious anymore, but maybe the church visit was important to her for emotional reasons rather than religious ones. The author might not realize that showing up for her during a tough time is more important than the actual church attendance. The girlfriend might be using the church as a way to cope or honor her father's memory, even if she's not deeply religious now.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they're both not religious, there's no point. But maybe the author isn't considering the symbolic aspect\u2014being supportive through her traditions, even if they don't share them. The girlfriend's crying and sulking suggest she felt unsupported. The author might be prioritizing their own beliefs over her emotional needs. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't accommodate her emotional request, even if it's not their personal belief. It's about being there for her in a time of grief, not necessarily about religion.\n"
