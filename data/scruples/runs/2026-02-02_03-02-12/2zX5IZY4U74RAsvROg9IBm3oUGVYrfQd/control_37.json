I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor the girlfriend is very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and they had a tradition of going to church on Easter. This year, the girlfriend asked the author to go with her, but he refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. They fought, and now she's upset.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out if the author's refusal was wrong. The key points here are about respecting traditions and the girlfriend's feelings. The author's reasoning is that they aren't religious, and since the girlfriend isn't either, they don't need to go. But maybe the girlfriend is using this time to honor her dad and family traditions, even if she's not super religious now. The fact that she went with her family every year before might be important to her as a way to cope with her father's death.\n\nThe author might not realize that even if he isn't religious, the act of going to church could be meaningful to her for emotional reasons. He might be dismissing her needs by saying she doesn't have to go, but she might need the support of a partner in that moment. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that his refusal hurt her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has his own beliefs and doesn't want to pretend to believe in something. But in a relationship, sometimes you have to make compromises. Even if he's not religious, showing up for her out of respect for her family's traditions and her emotional state might be expected. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider that his refusal might be important to her for reasons beyond religion, like honoring her dad and family. The girlfriend might have wanted him to be there for her emotionally, not just religiously. The answer might lean towards A (Yes), he's in the wrong because he didn't support her in her time of need, even if it's about a tradition they don't share.\n"
