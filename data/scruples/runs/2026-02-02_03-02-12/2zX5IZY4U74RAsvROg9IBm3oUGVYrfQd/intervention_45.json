I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't go to church with their girlfriend after her dad's death is in the wrong. The situation involves their differing levels of religiosity. The author isn't religious, the girlfriend is only somewhat religious but her family is very religious. The girlfriend's dad died, and she wanted to go to Easter church with the author. He refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's position is that he's respecting his own beliefs and the girlfriend isn't super religious either. The girlfriend, however, might see the church service as a meaningful tradition, especially after her father's death. Even though she's not very religious now, maybe the family traditions are important for her to process grief. The author's refusal could be seen as dismissive of her needs during a tough time.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author did say he's been there for her and tried to support her. He might not be the type to fake going to church for someone else's sake. The question is about whether his refusal is wrong. Religions and traditions can be deeply personal, and supporting a partner through grief often involves respecting their needs, even if they differ from your own. However, there's also the aspect of personal beliefs and autonomy. If the author isn't religious, forcing himself to attend might not be genuine support. But if the girlfriend feels it's important for her healing, then the author might be missing an opportunity to show solidarity. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting his own values and respecting her emotional needs. The key here is whether the author's refusal was considerate. He said they don't need to go because she's not religious, but she might still find comfort in tradition. Maybe a middle ground could have been found, like attending part of the service or finding another way to honor her father. The fact that the girlfriend is upset and they had a big fight suggests that the author's refusal hurt her feelings. In relationships, empathy often matters more than sticking strictly to one's beliefs, especially during vulnerable times. So while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not attending, he might have failed to adequately consider her emotional needs, which could place some responsibility on him. However, if he genuinely can't fake attending, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The answer depends on how much he considered her perspective versus his own.\n"
