I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation involves their differing levels of religious commitment.\n\nFirst, the context: Neither the author nor his girlfriend is very religious. She goes to church occasionally, like on Christmas and Easter, mainly for family traditions. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Now, after her dad's death, she asked him to go to Easter church with her this year. He refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. They fought, and she's upset.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting traditions and emotional support. Even if the author is not religious, his girlfriend might find comfort in these traditions, especially during a time of grief. She mentioned she can't fly home, so going to church locally might be a way to honor her dad's memory. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her during a vulnerable time, regardless of his personal beliefs.\n\nHe argues that she's not very religious now and said she doesn't really want to go. However, she might still value the tradition for emotional reasons, not necessarily religious ones. The fight suggests she felt he wasn't respecting her needs. The author's stance might be about his beliefs, but the issue is about supporting her through her grief. So, even if he's not religious, his refusal could be seen as dismissive of her emotional needs and family traditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't support her emotional needs during a difficult time, even if his reasons are based on personal beliefs.\n"
