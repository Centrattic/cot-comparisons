I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation involves their differing levels of religious involvement.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family is very religious, and she went to church with them often. Her dad recently died, and she wanted to attend church on Easter, which was a tradition. The author, who isn't religious, refused to go, leading to a fight. \n\nThe key points here are about traditions, emotional support, and respecting each other's beliefs. The girlfriend is dealing with grief and trying to maintain a connection to her family's traditions, which might be important for her healing. The author's refusal might come across as dismissive of her emotional needs, even if he doesn't personally believe in the tradition. \n\nEven though the author claims both are not very religious now, the girlfriend's request might be more about honoring her father and her family's customs rather than strict religious belief. The author's response could be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs during a difficult time. \n\nSo, while the author has his own beliefs and isn't wrong for having them, the situation requires empathy and support. Refusing to participate in a meaningful tradition for her could be seen as not being considerate enough, hence being in the wrong.\n"
