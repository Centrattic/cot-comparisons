I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them is very religious, but her family is. The girlfriend wanted to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition for her family, but the author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's girlfriend is dealing with her dad's death, which is a tough time. She might be reaching out for support from her family's traditions. The author says he's there for her, but when she asked for church on Easter, he refused, citing his lack of belief and the desire to not attend. She even said she doesn't really want to go now, but the author still said no. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the balance between respecting the girlfriend's needs and the author's beliefs. The girlfriend might need support during this time, and attending church might be her way of connecting with her family or finding comfort. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up as a supportive partner could mean a lot to her, regardless of his beliefs. However, the author is also entitled to his beliefs and might not feel comfortable attending a religious service he doesn't believe in. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend said she doesn't really want to go now. Maybe she's conflicted. If she's not even going, why did she ask him? Maybe she thought it would be important to her family, or she hoped he'd support her by going. If the author didn't go, but she also isn't going, is that a problem? Or is it more about the gesture? The author might be missing the point of showing support, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. \n\nAlso, the author says he doesn't want to sit through the entire service. Maybe they could have compromised? Like attending part of it or finding another way to show support. The fact that it turned into a big fight suggests that there's more at stake than just the service. The author's refusal might have been perceived as not supporting her during a difficult time, which could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his beliefs and isn't trying to pretend to believe something he doesn't. That's important for authenticity in a relationship. But when it comes to supporting a partner, sometimes showing up and being present is more important than the specific activity. The key is whether the author is being supportive in other ways. The girlfriend might have felt that going to church was a way she needed him to be there, and his refusal made her feel unsupported. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author isn't religious and the girlfriend isn't even going, maybe there's another way to support her. But the act of attending the service might be a symbolic gesture of support. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her needs, even if they're not religious. However, if the author is being truthful about his beliefs and the girlfriend isn't going either, maybe the problem is more about communication than the action itself. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's being honest about his beliefs and the girlfriend isn't even going. However, the way he handled it might have been insensitive. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and there's no explicit requirement for him to attend church, the answer might be B. But I'm a bit conflicted because supporting a partner in their time of need is important, and sometimes that means doing things you don't personally believe in. But if the partner isn't even going, maybe it's not necessary. Hmm.\n"
