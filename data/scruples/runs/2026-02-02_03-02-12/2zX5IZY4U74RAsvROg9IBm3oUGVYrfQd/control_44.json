I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend's dad died a few months ago. They aren't very religious, but her family is. The girlfriend wanted him to go to church with her on Easter, which was a tradition for her family. He refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. Now she's upset, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with her father's death, which is a significant emotional time. Even if they aren't religious, traditions can be important for grieving. The author says she's not super religious now, but her family has been religious, so maybe she still values some traditions, especially around mourning.\n\nThe author says he's there for her but refused to attend church. But when someone is grieving, showing support through their cultural or family traditions might be important. Even if he doesn't believe in it, participating could be a way to show solidarity. The girlfriend might feel that he's not supporting her by not joining her, even if she's not religious now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and unwillingness to attend. That's his right. But the problem is that she asked him to go, possibly to have his support in a way that's meaningful to her. Refusing might come across as dismissive of her needs during a tough time.\n\nSo, the key points are: the emotional context of grief, the importance of traditions in coping, and mutual support in a relationship. The author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs, even if he's being honest. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not accommodating her request despite his personal beliefs.\n"
