I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is during Easter, which is a significant time for her family even though she's not super religious. \n\nFirst, the author isn't religious at all, and their girlfriend only goes occasionally. She's trying to adjust after her dad's death, which is a big deal. She asked him to go to church with her, but he refused because he doesn't believe and didn't want to sit through the service. He said they don't need to go since she's not that religious either. That led to a fight about traditions.\n\nSo, the key points here are about respecting her emotional needs and traditions. Even if he's not religious, supporting her in a time of grief is important. She might need the comfort of the tradition, especially since she can't go home. His refusal might come off as not understanding her needs, even if she's not super religious. But he's also being honest about his beliefs and isn't forcing himself to go.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. If the relationship requires compromise, then maybe he should have gone. But if he's clear about his beliefs and she still feels hurt, maybe he's not wrong. But considering that she's in a vulnerable state, not supporting her in a way that helps her cope could be seen as inconsiderate. So, probably AITA is A (wrong) because he didn't support her emotional needs despite her asking, even if it's not his belief.\n"
