I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The girlfriend is not very religious now but her family is, and she wanted to go to church on Easter. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't religious and the girlfriend isn't either now. However, her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now, she's trying to cope with her dad's death and wants to honor traditions. She asked him to go to church with her, but he refused, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author argues that he's not being in the wrong because neither of them is religious. But the girlfriend's request is about her personal coping mechanism and honoring her family's traditions, especially during a difficult time. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her emotionally, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. On the other hand, the author might feel he's not required to participate in something he doesn't believe in.\n\nI should also think about the girlfriend's perspective. She might see church as a way to grieve and connect with her family's traditions. If she's already struggling, the author's refusal could feel like he's not fully supporting her emotional needs. Even if she says she doesn't want to go, maybe she still wants the support from her partner.\n\nBut then again, the author is respecting his own beliefs and boundaries. There's a balance between supporting a partner and respecting personal boundaries. However, in times of grief, partners often expect each other to make compromises. The author's refusal might be seen as not making that effort, which could be seen as the wrong thing, even if he's being honest about his beliefs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because supporting a partner during grief sometimes requires stepping outside one's comfort zone, even if it's not something you personally believe in. Alternatively, if the author had offered alternative support, it might be different, but he refused outright. So AITA would likely say A.\n"
