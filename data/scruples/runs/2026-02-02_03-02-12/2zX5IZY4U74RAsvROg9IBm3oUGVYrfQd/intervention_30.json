I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The scenario is that neither the person nor their girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them when required, but now she's trying to navigate her own feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's emotional state after her father's death and the request for support. The person refused to go to church, citing their lack of belief and not wanting to sit through the service. The girlfriend felt it was a tradition important to her family, and the refusal led to a fight.\n\nI need to consider the balance between respecting personal beliefs and showing support during a difficult time. Even if the person isn't religious, being present for their partner's emotional needs might be important. The girlfriend mentioned she doesn't really want to go, but the tradition might still have significance for her family, and her request could be more about shared support than the act itself.\n\nHowever, the person did say they don't want to sit through the service and don't believe in it. That's a valid personal choice. But maybe there's a middle ground, like going to the church with her without participating in the service, just being there for moral support. The fact that the person said they don't need to go now because she's not religious might have come off as dismissive of her emotional needs or her family's traditions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was a big fight and her being upset. The person does feel bad, but they don't see the point. It's possible that the gesture of going together, even without full participation, would be seen as supportive. So maybe the person made a mistake in not finding a compromise, even if they don't personally believe in it. Supporting a partner during grief might involve some sacrifices, especially when the partner is trying to honor family traditions as a way to cope.\n\nOn the other hand, the person isn't religious and might not want to pretend to be for the sake of the relationship. There's a balance between respecting their own beliefs and respecting their partner's needs. The girlfriend also said she doesn't really want to go, which could mean she's conflicted. So maybe the person isn't entirely at fault, but there's room to argue that they could have been more supportive in another way.\n\nHmm. The answer might depend on whether the refusal to participate in the tradition, despite the partner's request, is seen as not being supportive. Since the girlfriend is struggling and the person is her support system, not going might be a mistake. But if the person's beliefs are strong enough that they can't participate at all, maybe they're not wrong. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the person being in the wrong because the request was about emotional support, not the religion itself.\n"
