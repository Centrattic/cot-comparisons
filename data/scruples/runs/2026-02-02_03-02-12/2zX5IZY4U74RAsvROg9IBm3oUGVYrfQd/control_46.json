I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. So the situation is that the girlfriend's dad passed away a few months ago, and she's been struggling with it. The girlfriend isn't super religious but does go to church occasionally, like Christmas and Easter, especially because her family is religious. Her family wanted her to go to church with them, and she used to. Now, she can't fly home for Easter and asked her boyfriend to go to church with her. But the boyfriend said no because he's not religious and doesn't believe in it. He also mentioned that she's not really religious anymore, so they don't need to go. This led to a big fight about traditions, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The boyfriend isn't religious at all, and the girlfriend is only somewhat religious, but her family is. The girl is dealing with her dad's death, and Easter is a time when she used to go to church with her family. Now that she can't be there, she's asking her partner to go with her. But the boyfriend refuses because of his beliefs. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe main factors here are about respecting each other's beliefs and being supportive during a difficult time. The girlfriend might be using this as a way to cope with her grief, even if she's not super religious now. The boyfriend might think that since she's not religious, it's not necessary, but maybe the tradition is important to her for emotional support. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is often needed. The boyfriend isn't forcing her to go, but he's refusing to go with her, which might make her feel unsupported. Even if he doesn't believe in the religious aspects, just being there with her might be more about moral support than religious practice. The fact that she's sad and upset suggests that this was important to her, and the boyfriend's refusal might have caused hurt feelings.\n\nBut then again, the boyfriend is honest about his beliefs and isn't pretending to go. However, sometimes in relationships, you have to do things that are uncomfortable for the sake of the other person's well-being. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she might feel a cultural or familial duty to participate, even if she's not religious. The boyfriend's refusal could be seen as not respecting her family's traditions or her emotional needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend isn't wrong for not wanting to attend a service he doesn't believe in. But the key is whether he's willing to support her in her way of coping. If the girlfriend asked him to go, maybe it's not about the religion but about having her partner there with her. The boyfriend's response might be dismissive of her emotional needs. The answer might depend on how much the boyfriend is being supportive versus sticking to his beliefs. \n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend is dealing with grief and the boyfriend is her partner, the expectation might be that he would try to support her in her chosen way, even if it's not something he personally believes in. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't support her, even if it's not a religious act for her. Alternatively, if the boyfriend is right to stick to his beliefs, then B. But given that the girlfriend is upset and it's a significant family tradition for her, the boyfriend might be in the wrong by not compromising.\n"
