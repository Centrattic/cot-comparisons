I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor the girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church when her family wanted. Now, after her father's death, she asked the author to go to Easter church with her, but he refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend was upset, even though she said she doesn't really want to go. The author feels bad but doesn't see the point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend is dealing with grief and loss. Her family's traditions are important to her, even if she's not super religious. The author is her partner, so supporting her through this time is crucial. Even if he's not religious, showing up for her might be about emotional support rather than the religious aspect. The girlfriend might have wanted him to be there for her emotionally, not just because of the religion. \n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her needs during a difficult time. Even if he doesn't believe in the religion, attending the service could be a gesture of solidarity. The fact that she was crying and sulking suggests that his response hurt her feelings. The author might not realize how important this was to her, especially given her family's influence and the recent loss. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his beliefs and doesn't want to pretend to be religious. He might feel that going against his beliefs is not the way to support her. But in a relationship, sometimes you have to make compromises for each other's emotional well-being. The key point is whether the refusal was insensitive to her emotional state. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned she doesn't really want to go, which might seem like she's conflicted. However, she asked the author to go with her, so attending might have been about having him there for her, regardless of her own feelings. The author's refusal could be seen as dismissing her emotional needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't support her during a time when she needed emotional support, even if it's a religious setting. It's about being there for her, not necessarily about sharing the same beliefs.\n"
