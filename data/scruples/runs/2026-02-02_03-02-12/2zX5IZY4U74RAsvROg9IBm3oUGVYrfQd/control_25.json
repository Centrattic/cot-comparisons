I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her father died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter. He refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with her father's death, which is a significant emotional event. Church might be important for her family's traditions and her own coping process. Even if she's not very religious now, the tradition and the support from her family could be important. The author is there for her in general but refused this specific request, which led to conflict.\n\nThe author argues that they don't need to go because she's not that religious and he doesn't believe. But maybe she wanted to go for emotional reasons, not just religious ones. His refusal might have made her feel unsupported during a tough time. Even if she said she doesn't want to go, maybe she still wanted him to accompany her for her own reasons, like facing it together or respecting her family's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has his own beliefs and is honest about not wanting to go. He might feel that respecting each other's beliefs is important. But being in a relationship often involves compromise, especially when it comes to supporting each other through difficult times.\n\nSo, is he wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't go, but he tried to explain his reasons. However, the situation is sensitive because her father just died. Maybe he should have considered her emotional needs more, even if he wasn't religious. Maybe there's a middle ground, like attending for a short time or a different gesture of support.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about empathy and support. If she wanted him there for emotional reasons, not just religious, then refusing might have been hurtful. She might feel he wasn't there for her when she needed support. So, possibly, the author is in the wrong because he didn't prioritize her emotional needs over his own beliefs in this case.\n"
