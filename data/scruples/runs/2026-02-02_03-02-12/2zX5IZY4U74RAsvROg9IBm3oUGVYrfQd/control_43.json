I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. So, the user didn't go to church with their girlfriend after her dad died because they're not religious. The girlfriend is somewhat religious, especially during big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is very religious, and she used to go to church a lot when they wanted her to. Now, her dad passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, but the user refused. The girlfriend is upset and crying, and they had a big fight.\n\nHmm. The user's reasoning is that they don't want to sit through the whole service and don't believe in religion. They also said she's not that religious anymore. But the girlfriend's family traditions are important to her, especially after her dad's death. Maybe she wanted to honor her dad by going to church, even if she's not super religious now. The user didn't consider that maybe she needed the support, even if she doesn't believe. \n\nSo, the key points here: The user is being asked to support their partner during a grieving time. Even if they don't share the religious beliefs, showing up could be a way to show solidarity. The user's refusal might have hurt her feelings because it seemed like they weren't supporting her. Even if the user isn't religious, being present for her during a tough time could be more important. The user might have been too quick to dismiss her request, not considering her emotional needs beyond just the religious aspect. \n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't in the wrong if they genuinely can't bring themselves to attend because of their beliefs. But in a relationship, sometimes you have to make compromises for each other's emotional well-being. The fact that the user said \"we don't even need to go now\" might have come off as dismissive of her wishes. Maybe they didn't communicate properly, or didn't understand the importance of the gesture. \n\nIn the end, the user's refusal might have been seen as not being supportive enough, especially during a time when the girlfriend is dealing with grief. So, the answer might be that the user is in the wrong because they didn't support their partner's emotional needs, even if it's not their own belief system.\n"
