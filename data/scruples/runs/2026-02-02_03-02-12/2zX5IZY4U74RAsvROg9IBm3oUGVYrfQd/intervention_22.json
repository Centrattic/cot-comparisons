I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor the girlfriend are very religious, but her family is. The girlfriend wanted to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition for her family. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. They fought about it, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's argument is that they both aren't religious, and the girlfriend even said she doesn't really want to go. The author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to pretend. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the tradition is important for her healing, even if she's not religious. Her family's expectations might be a factor here. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The key factors are communication, respect for each other's needs, and the context of loss. The author did tell her he didn't believe in it and didn't want to go, which shows honesty. However, the girlfriend might be seeking comfort in tradition during a difficult time. Even if she's not religious, the act of going with her family might be important for her emotional support. \n\nBut the author also mentioned that the girlfriend said she doesn't want to go, so maybe she's conflicted. The author could have offered an alternative, like attending a different kind of service or finding another way to support her without going to church. However, the author's refusal is based on his beliefs, which are valid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to attend, but maybe he could have been more considerate in his approach. However, the girlfriend's feelings are also valid. The main issue is whether the author respected her emotional needs. Since the author is being honest and the girlfriend is conflicted, it's hard to say one is entirely wrong. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I lean towards B. However, there's a middle ground where the author could have tried to find a compromise, which might have prevented the argument. Still, the author isn't obligated to attend a religion he doesn't believe in. So, the answer is B.\n"
