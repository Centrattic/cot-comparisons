I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a long-term engaged couple with two kids, and the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's snoring and need for loud TV noise disrupting the author's sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and can't hear the TV unless it's on a high volume. He sometimes compromises, but not enough. The author's frustration led them to suggest separate rooms, which the fianc\u00e9 found unacceptable, comparing it to being roommates instead of a couple.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author's right to a good night's sleep versus the couple's relationship dynamics. The author has been dealing with this for 9 years (8 together, 1 engaged) and two kids, implying this has been a persistent issue. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep deprivation for the author, which can affect health and well-being. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the fianc\u00e9's behavior (snoring and loud TV) is the root cause. While the author's solution might seem drastic, it's a response to a long-standing problem. However, moving to separate rooms could affect their relationship. But the author's mental and physical health is important. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic, but the author is seeking a solution. Since the author has tried compromising (like lower volume) and the fianc\u00e9's side isn't working, the author's decision might be justified. \n\nBut maybe there are other solutions first? Like using earplugs, a white noise machine, or a different setup. However, the author might have tried these already. The post says the fianc\u00e9's reaction is about not seeing the point of being a couple anymore, which is a valid concern, but the author's need for rest is also valid. \n\nIn terms of cultural or social norms, some couples do sleep separately, especially for health reasons. The AITA community often considers long-term issues and whose behavior is causing harm. Here, the fianc\u00e9's actions are directly causing harm. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution to protect their well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
