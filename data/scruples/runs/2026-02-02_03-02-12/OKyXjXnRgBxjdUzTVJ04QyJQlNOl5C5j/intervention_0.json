I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who keeps the TV on loudly, causing sleep issues. The author is a light sleeper, so this has been a long-term problem. They've been together 8 years with two kids, which adds context about the relationship's stability and the need for solutions.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep deprivation. The author tried to compromise by having the volume lowered a bit, but it's not enough. The mention that the fianc\u00e9 responds sleepily when the volume is turned down shows that he's not actively compromising but just reacting. The author finally snaps after years of this, leading to the suggestion of separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is emotional, questioning the purpose of being a couple if they can't share a bed. However, the author's main goal is getting rest, which is crucial for health and functioning as a parent. The situation has gone on for a long time without resolution, indicating the author's frustration is justified. \n\nWhile relationships require compromise, the fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's well-being and the kids. The solution of separate rooms is a practical one to address the immediate problem. The author isn't rejecting the relationship but seeking a way to cohabit without conflict. It's about finding a middle ground that respects both partners' needs. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not seeing the issue as severe, but the author has legitimate reasons. So, the answer is B.\n"
