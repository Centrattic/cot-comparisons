I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The author is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV at a high volume, which disrupts the author's sleep. They've been dealing with this for 8 years together, 1 year engaged, and have two kids. The author finally had enough and wants to sleep in separate rooms.\n\nSo, the key points here are about sleep quality and mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9 is not responsive to the author's needs, even when he sometimes lowers the volume slightly. The author argues that they deserve good sleep, which is important for their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response is that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, which is a valid concern about the relationship dynamics.\n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's quality of life. Sleep deprivation can have serious effects on a person's physical and mental health. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, and suggesting separate rooms might be a last resort after trying compromises that haven't worked. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship, but the author's needs are legitimate. It's about balancing personal needs with the relationship. The author isn't trying to push the fianc\u00e9 out but to find a way to coexist without harm. Since the fianc\u00e9 isn't making significant efforts to adjust, the author's decision could be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is important in a relationship. Both partners should work towards finding a solution, and separate rooms might be necessary if compromises fail.\n"
