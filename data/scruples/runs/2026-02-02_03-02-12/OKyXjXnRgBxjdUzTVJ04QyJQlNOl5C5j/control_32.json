I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and keeps the TV on loud. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with bad sleep for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disturbed every night. Chronic lack of good sleep can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. They mention they've been dealing with this for eight years and a year engaged, with two kids. That's a long time to endure something that's impacting their quality of life. So, from the author's perspective, this is a legitimate concern that's affecting their health.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are deeply ingrained. He's a heavy sleeper, and even if he sometimes lowers the volume a bit, he still prefers the TV on. He's not waking up when the author turns it down, which suggests he's not aware of the impact on the author. His response is emotional, thinking that separate rooms would make them just roommates, which is a valid concern for the relationship. But is his response reasonable?\n\nThe author's request is about their personal well-being. Sleep is a basic need. If sharing a room isn't possible without causing harm to the author's health, then the solution of separate rooms might be necessary. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems to conflate the idea of separate rooms with the relationship's validity. But in many relationships, especially with kids, practical arrangements like separate rooms can exist without undermining the relationship. For example, some couples choose separate beds for various reasons, and that doesn't negate their commitment.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9 isn't compromising enough. Lowering the volume by three points isn't sufficient for a light sleeper. The author's health and rest are important, and if the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust his habits, then the author is justified in seeking a solution that works for them. The fianc\u00e9's resistance seems more about how it feels rather than addressing the actual problem of the author's sleep deprivation.\n\nAlso, considering they have two kids, the author's need for rest is even more critical for parenting effectively. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to issues like irritability, decreased cognitive function, and health problems. The author's decision to prioritize their health isn't selfish; it's necessary for their own well-being and, by extension, their ability to care for the children and maintain the relationship.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 might need to find other ways to relax without disturbing the author, like using earplugs or a white noise machine. However, the author's suggestion of separate rooms is a practical solution when other compromises fail. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, while understandable, doesn't consider the long-term effects of the author's sleep issues. If the author continues to suffer, it could lead to resentment and deeper relationship problems. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution that addresses their legitimate needs.\n"
