I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is engaged to someone with whom they've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, and they have two kids. The main issue is the sleeping habits. The author is a light sleeper needing quiet, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. Despite some compromises, the noise keeps the author up, leading them to suggest separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is against this, comparing it to just being roommates.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key factors here are the impact on the author's well-being and the reasonableness of their solution. Chronic poor sleep can lead to health issues, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption, and the author has tried to make some compromises (lowering TV volume slightly). However, the fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive, which might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to make adjustments. However, when one person's needs are consistently not met, especially when it comes to basic health needs like rest, it's reasonable for the other to seek a solution. Sleeping apart isn't ideal, but if the alternative is constant sleep deprivation, it might be necessary. The fianc\u00e9's argument that separate rooms would make them just roommates is a bit extreme, as couples do sleep separately for various reasons without it meaning the relationship is over.\n\nSo, considering the long-term effects of sleep deprivation and the fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust, the author's decision seems justified. They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
