I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a quiet room, but the partner is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies, and turns up the TV. The author is frustrated with not getting good sleep and suggests separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The partner's habits are interfering with that, and they've tried to compromise before. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which is a practical approach to resolve the conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately might be a step back from their relationship. But the author has been dealing with this for years. They have kids, so the stress of poor sleep might be compounding. The partner's response seems dismissive, not addressing the root issue. \n\nThe key points here are the impact on health, the duration of the problem, and the attempts at compromise. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're seeking a solution after enduring the problem for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the symbolism of separate rooms rather than the actual problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a real issue that affects their well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
