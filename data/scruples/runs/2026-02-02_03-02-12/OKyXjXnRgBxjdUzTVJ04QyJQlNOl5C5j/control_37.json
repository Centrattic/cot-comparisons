I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is engaged to someone they've been with for 8 years, engaged for 1 year, and they have two kids. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on watching TV at high volume while sleeping. The author is a light sleeper and can't get a good night's rest. They've tried some compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's still causing the author significant sleep problems. The author suggested sleeping in separate rooms, and now the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to address a legitimate problem that's affecting their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences, so seeking a solution like separate rooms might be reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this issue, and the author has tried some compromises, but they haven't worked. The author's request seems reasonable as a last resort after trying to work around the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the suggestion of separate rooms is a step back in their relationship. They might believe that couples should make more effort to accommodate each other, especially given the length of the relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here. The author isn't asking to end the relationship but to improve their quality of life. \n\nLooking at the AITA subreddit norms, people often side with those who are making reasonable requests to improve their health and well-being. The author isn't being selfish; they're asking for a solution to a problem that's beyond their control. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the issue, and the author is seeking a practical solution. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is likely B.\n"
