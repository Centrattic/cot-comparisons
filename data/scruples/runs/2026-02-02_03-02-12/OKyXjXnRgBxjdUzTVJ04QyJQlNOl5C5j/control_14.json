I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to be able to adjust, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid complaint about their sleep being disrupted every night. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being, so this isn't just a petty issue. The fianc\u00e9's habits are clearly causing this problem. The author has tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's breaking point was understandable given the eight years together and having kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's response is emotional, questioning the point of being a couple if they don't share a bed. But that seems more like a defensive reaction rather than a rational argument. Sharing a bed is common, but not a requirement for a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust or find other solutions (like using a white noise machine, earplugs, or maybe a different sleep environment) might be part of the problem. The author's request for separate rooms is a practical solution to a real problem they're facing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're trying to address their needs and well-being. The fianc\u00e9 isn't accommodating, so the author's decision to seek a separate space isn't unreasonable. The key points here are the impact on health, the duration of the issue, and the lack of effective solutions from the fianc\u00e9's side. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
