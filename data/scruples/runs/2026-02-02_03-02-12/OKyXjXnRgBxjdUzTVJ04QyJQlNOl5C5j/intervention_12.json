I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey're a light sleeper and want a quiet room. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and insists on sleeping with the TV on at a high volume. They've been trying to compromise, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9 even turns the TV on with loud action movies every night, which really disrupts their sleep. They tried to turn it down, but he wakes up in his sleep and complains. After years of this, the author had enough and suggested sleeping in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea because they can't share a bed and might as well be roommates. The author just wants good sleep and has kids, so it's been a long time of dealing with this.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is sleep deprivation due to the partner's habits. The author is trying to get rest, which is essential for health and being a good parent. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. They've tried compromising, but it's not working. The author's request seems reasonable because sleep is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling that the relationship is being questioned, but the author isn't rejecting the relationship; they just need a solution to their sleep problem. Separate rooms could be a practical solution if they can't resolve the issue otherwise. The fact that they've been together for years and have kids adds weight to the long-term stress this issue has caused. The fianc\u00e9's behavior (needing the TV on loudly) might be something he's not willing to change, which makes separate rooms a possible necessity. So I don't think the author is in the wrong here. They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is important in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9 needs to adjust, but if he can't, separate rooms might be the only solution. Answer B.\n"
