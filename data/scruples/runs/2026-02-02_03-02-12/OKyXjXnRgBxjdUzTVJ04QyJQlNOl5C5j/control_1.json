I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who keeps the TV on loud, causing disturbances. The user is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years, even after 8 years together and being engaged for a year with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive and haven't been resolved despite the user's attempts to compromise. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive, comparing the situation to just being roommates, which might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nHowever, moving to separate rooms is a significant step. It's important to check if all other solutions have been exhausted. Have they tried earplugs, white noise machines, discussing the issue more, or adjusting the TV volume more significantly? The user mentioned the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers it by 3 points, but maybe that's not enough. Also, the fianc\u00e9's need for the TV might be due to anxiety or habit, which isn't addressed here.\n\nBut the user has been dealing with this for years. Their mental health and sleep are important. Relationships require compromise, but both partners need to meet in the middle. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make necessary changes, the user's decision to prioritize their own well-being isn't unreasonable. It's about finding a balance between maintaining the relationship and self-care.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've tried to adjust, but the situation isn't improving. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to devalue the user's needs. The answer is likely B.\n"
