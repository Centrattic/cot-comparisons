I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The context is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who turns the TV on loud every night, causing the author, a light sleeper, to have bad sleep for years. They've been together 8 years, engaged for a year, and have two kids. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to sleep in separate rooms because he thinks they might as well be roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to noise. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so their concern is valid. They've tried to compromise, like lowering the volume, but the fianc\u00e9 still can't hear it when it's turned down. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is used to sleeping with the TV for some reason\u2014maybe it helps him fall asleep, perhaps due to insomnia or a habit. He might not realize how much his behavior is affecting the author.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the problem (8 years) and the attempts at compromise. The author has been dealing with this for a long time, and suggesting separate rooms is their \"last straw\" moment. The fianc\u00e9's argument is emotional, saying that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple. But in reality, couples often have different sleep needs and some may choose to sleep separately for various reasons, like health, comfort, or cultural practices. It's not necessarily a reflection of the relationship's validity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is looking for a judgment between A and B. The fianc\u00e9 isn't being considerate of the author's needs, and the author is prioritizing their health. However, the author's reaction might be seen as extreme. Maybe they could try more solutions first, like a white noise machine, earplugs, or a sleep apnea device since he snores. But the author has been trying to compromise, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't adjusting. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are essential. The author tried to find a middle ground but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9 is not open to their needs, so the author is taking a step to protect their well-being. Even though they are engaged with kids, the author's health is important. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
