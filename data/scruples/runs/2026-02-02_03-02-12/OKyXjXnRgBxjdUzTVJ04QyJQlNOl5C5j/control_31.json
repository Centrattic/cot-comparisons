I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snors loudly and watches loud TV shows at night. The fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a bit but not enough. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, with 1 year engaged and two kids. They finally had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they don't share a bed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the impact on the author's well-being due to lack of sleep and the fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust his habits despite the author's complaints over a long period. The author is seeking a solution to their recurring problem, which affects their quality of life.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship's validity if they don't share a bed, but the author's need for rest is also significant. In relationships, compromise is essential. The author might be justified if they've tried all possible solutions and nothing works. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to prioritize the author's needs, even in his sleep. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and happiness, which is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive and long-standing. The suggestion for separate rooms is a reasonable step to improve their quality of life. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
