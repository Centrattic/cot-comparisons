I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and watches action movies with the TV loud, causing the author to have trouble sleeping. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time, so they suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep, which is important for health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disrupting that. He might not realize how much his actions are affecting the author, especially since he's a heavy sleeper and can't hear when the volume is turned down. The fact that he reacts even when the author turns it down in his sleep shows a lack of awareness.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, not a couple. That's a valid concern too because intimacy and shared experiences are part of a relationship. However, the author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The engagement is 1 year, so total 9 years together with two kids. That's a significant period, and the author's well-being is being compromised.\n\nThe key here is whether suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution. The author isn't rejecting the relationship but is seeking a solution to a practical problem. Sleep is crucial, and chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are part of his lifestyle, but the author is within their rights to ask for a change that benefits their own health. The author's request is not about separation but about improving their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to conflate separate rooms with the end of the relationship, which might be a misunderstanding. The author is looking for a compromise that allows both to have their needs met. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust his habits or find another way to enjoy his TV time without disturbing the author, but if that's not possible, separate rooms could be a necessary compromise.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their request is reasonable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's response is perhaps more about feeling rejected rather than understanding the necessity. The author's well-being is important, and they shouldn't be blamed for seeking a solution that affects their health.\n"
