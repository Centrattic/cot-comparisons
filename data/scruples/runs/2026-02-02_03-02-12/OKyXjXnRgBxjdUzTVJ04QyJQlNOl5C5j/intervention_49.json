I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is sleep disturbances because the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches loud TV shows before bed. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's request is for their own well-being, which is important. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption, and the author has tried compromising (like lowering the TV volume a bit), but it's not enough. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is about the relationship's purpose, implying that separate rooms would make them just roommates. That's a bit dismissive of the author's legitimate need. However, relationships require compromise from both sides. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 hasn't tried to adjust enough, or maybe there are other solutions they haven't explored yet. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's action is to protect their health and well-being, it's reasonable. They've tried to communicate and compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be part of the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that making a major life change like separate rooms is a drastic step. Maybe there are other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or a different TV setup. But if those have been tried and failed, then the author's decision is justified. \n\nGiven the context of eight years together and having kids, the author's frustration is understandable. They've been putting up with this for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's snoring and TV habits aren't things the author can control directly, so asking for separate rooms is a way to manage their own needs. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're acting in their own best interest after repeated issues. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to not take the author's needs seriously enough. Relationships should involve mutual respect for each other's needs, and if that's not happening, it's valid for the author to seek a solution that helps them.\n"
