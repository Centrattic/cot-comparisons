I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who also uses the TV at a high volume, which is disturbing their sleep. The author has tried to compromise but eventually suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is important for health and well-being. Chronic sleep disturbance can lead to various issues like fatigue, irritability, and even health problems. So, the author has a valid reason for wanting to change their situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is used to his sleeping habits. He might not realize how disruptive his behavior is. He's probably not doing it on purpose. The author's suggestion to sleep separately might make him feel rejected or worry about the relationship's future. He brings up the point about roommates, which is a common concern in relationships when people consider separate sleeping arrangements. \n\nBut the key here is that the author has tried to compromise. They mention that the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume, but it's not enough. The author tried to turn it down, but he wakes up in sleep to protest. That shows the fianc\u00e9's habits are deeply ingrained and hard to change. The author's decision comes after years of this issue, so it's not a spur-of-the-moment thing. Having two kids also adds stress, so getting enough rest is crucial.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to express their needs, and when that didn't work, they suggested a practical solution. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is understandable, but the author's health and well-being are important. Sleeping in separate rooms is a common solution for couples with incompatible sleep habits. It's not a sign of breaking up but a way to maintain the relationship by ensuring both partners are well-rested.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a significant problem that affects their daily life. The fianc\u00e9 needs to adjust or find another solution, but the author's action is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
