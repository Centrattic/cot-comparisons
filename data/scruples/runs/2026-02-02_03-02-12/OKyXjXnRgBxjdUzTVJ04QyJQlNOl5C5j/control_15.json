I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows before bed, which the author finds disruptive. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to change his habits, so the author suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep, especially since they've been dealing with this for 8 years and have kids. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are part of his bedtime routine, and he might feel that his needs aren't being considered either. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple, might be an overreaction. Relationships often require compromises, and sleeping in separate rooms isn't uncommon in some cultures or situations. The author's request isn't about avoiding the relationship but about improving their quality of life. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their fianc\u00e9 doesn't adjust the TV volume much, even when he sometimes does. The author is frustrated after years of this, so suggesting a separate room seems like a reasonable solution to a recurring problem. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they could be roommates instead misses the point that they're still committed with kids and an engagement. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't being unreasonable. They've tried to communicate and compromise, but the situation hasn't improved. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to adjust his habits despite the impact on the author's health might make the author's decision justified. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
