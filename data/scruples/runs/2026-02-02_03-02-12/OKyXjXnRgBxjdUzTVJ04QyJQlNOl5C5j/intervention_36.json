I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud action movies on the TV at half volume, which disturbs the author, a light sleeper. The author asked to sleep separately, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for 1 year, two kids. They've been trying to manage the TV volume, but it's still causing sleep issues. The author is prioritizing their health and well-being by seeking a solution that works for them. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 sees separate rooms as a problem, implying it's a relationship issue.\n\nSleep is important for physical and mental health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health problems. The author is not asking for anything unreasonable; just a quiet environment. Suggesting separate rooms is a common solution for couples with differing sleep needs. It's not about wanting to avoid the partner but about necessary self-care. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive of the author's needs, which could indicate a deeper issue in how they handle conflicts.\n\nThere's no indication that the author has not tried other solutions. They mentioned the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume, but it's not enough. The author's frustration is valid after years of poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9's argument that separate rooms negate the purpose of being a couple is a bit extreme. Many couples use separate rooms for various reasons without it affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should consider each other's needs. The fianc\u00e9's habit of needing the TV on is a personal preference, but it's affecting the author's well-being. The author is taking a stand to protect their health. While communication is key, the author has tried negotiating the TV volume without success. The final decision to sleep separately is a reasonable step when other solutions fail.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to a good night's sleep, which is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about feeling rejected rather than addressing the actual problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
