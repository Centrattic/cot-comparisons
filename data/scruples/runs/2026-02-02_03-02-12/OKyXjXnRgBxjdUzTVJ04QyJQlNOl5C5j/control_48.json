I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged to someone who is a heavy sleeper and insists on watching TV loudly at night. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years, leading to poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if it's turned down and responds while asleep. After years of this, the author suggests separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea. The author wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for sleep, which is essential for health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, so it's reasonable for them to want a solution. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and maybe he hasn't been as considerate as he could be. However, moving to separate rooms is a significant step. Have they tried other solutions first? Like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV volume differently? The author mentions the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume by 3 points, but that might not be enough.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is also understandable. Sharing a bedroom is a norm in relationships, so his concern about the commitment might be valid. But the author's health and well-being are also important. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make more compromises, maybe separate rooms are necessary. The fact that they've been together 8 years and the author has been dealing with this for so long suggests it's a long-standing issue that hasn't been resolved. \n\nIs the author at fault? It seems like they're trying to find a solution to a problem caused by the other person's habits. They've tried compromises, but nothing works. The fianc\u00e9 isn't fully aware of the issue since he's asleep when the TV is on. So, the author isn't being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about the change in routine rather than the necessity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
