I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to sleep in separate rooms. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, have two kids. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud action movies with the TV on half volume, which makes the author a light sleeper suffer. The author tried to ask for compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but the fianc\u00e9 can't hear it in his sleep. Now the author is suggesting separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea, questioning the point of being together if they can't share a bed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. The author has tried to communicate and make compromises, but it's not working. Sleep is a basic need, and if one partner's habits are preventing the other from getting it, that's a significant issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is giving up on sharing a room, which is a common aspect of a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could stem from feeling that the author is prioritizing their own comfort over the relationship's intimacy. However, the author argues that they've been dealing with this for years and have exhausted options. The fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust, even in his sleep, is a problem. \n\nIt's important to consider that in a healthy relationship, both partners should make efforts to accommodate each other's needs. If the author's health is suffering and all other solutions have failed, seeking a separate sleeping arrangement isn't unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is about the symbolic value of sharing a room, but practicality and well-being might take precedence here. The author's decision is about self-care, which is crucial. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
