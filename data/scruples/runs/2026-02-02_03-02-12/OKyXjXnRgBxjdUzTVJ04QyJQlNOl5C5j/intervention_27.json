I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation involves the author being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and TV habits.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both perspectives. The author clearly states they've been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together and a year engaged. They have two kids, so their sleep issues might also affect their ability to care for the children and their overall well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts, so the author's request for a good night's sleep seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's response is about the emotional aspect of the relationship. He argues that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates. This brings up the emotional significance of sharing a bed in a relationship. However, the author is justified in prioritizing their health and comfort, especially given the long-standing issue. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent disruption, and the author has tried to compromise (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit) but it's not enough.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling accused or not understanding the severity of the sleep issues. But the author's main concern is legitimate. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 can't adjust his habits despite the author's requests shows a lack of consideration. The author's decision to seek a separate room is a practical solution to a recurring problem, not a sudden or selfish choice.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author has communicated their needs and tried to find solutions, but when those don't work, taking action is necessary. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to downplay the author's needs, which isn't healthy. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their well-being. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
