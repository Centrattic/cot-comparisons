I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on loudly. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main issue is their lack of sleep due to their partner's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, so the author is trying to find a solution that works for their well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the suggestion of separate rooms is a rejection or a step back from their relationship. He argues that if they can't share a bed, then being a couple is just like being roommates. That's a common concern in relationships where physical separation can feel like emotional distance.\n\nNow, looking at the duration of the issue\u20148 years together, engaged for a year, with two kids. The author has been putting up with this for a long time. It's possible they've tried compromises before, like adjusting the TV volume slightly, but it's not enough. The author's health and well-being are important, and sleep is a basic need. If the partner isn't willing to make necessary changes, then the author is justified in seeking an alternative solution.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about the symbolism of sharing a bed rather than the practical solution. However, the core issue is the author's need for rest. Relationships require mutual effort and compromise. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust his sleeping habits to accommodate the author's needs, it's reasonable for the author to take action to protect their health.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author did bring this up after trying to handle it for years, which shows they've given the situation time. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is emotional, but he hasn't offered real solutions. The author is looking for a practical fix, not just a temporary one like earplugs, which might not work given the TV volume and snoring.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to suggest separate rooms is about their health and quality of life. It's a hard choice, but not being in the wrong because their needs are legitimate. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid, but if he's not willing to make changes, the author has to prioritize their own well-being.\n"
