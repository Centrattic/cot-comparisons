I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV with high volume. The fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the TV volume a bit, but the author still ends up with a bad night's sleep. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested sleeping in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea and questioning their relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the conflict between the author's need for quiet sleep and the fianc\u00e9's habits. The author has tried to communicate their needs but the situation isn't improving. They've been together a long time with kids, which adds complexity.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally or morally? Probably morally, since it's a personal relationship. The author is not doing anything illegal, so it's about right and wrong in a relationship context. \n\nThe author's actions are based on their own needs and well-being. They've tried to compromise (the fianc\u00e9 lowers the volume a bit), but it's not enough. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health, so prioritizing that is understandable. Suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution if they can't find another compromise. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is also valid in a way, as some might see separate rooms as a step away from intimacy. But the author's priority is their health and sleep, which is essential. They have a long-term relationship with kids, so their stress from sleep deprivation could impact the whole family. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe, but they're addressing a legitimate need. The fianc\u00e9 isn't changing his behavior enough, so the author is taking action to protect their own well-being. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to prioritize their health. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to communicate and compromises aren't working, so suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable step to improve their quality of life.\n"
