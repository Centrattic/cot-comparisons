I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows at night, which disturbs the writer, a light sleeper. They've been together a long time and have kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The writer's main issue is lack of sleep due to noise. Chronic sleep deprivation can be serious, affecting health and daily functioning. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014watching loud TV and snoring\u2014seem to be the root cause. The writer tried to compromise by asking to lower the volume sometimes, but it's not enough. They finally suggest separate rooms. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that separate rooms would make them just roommates, not a couple. But they've been engaged for a year and together for eight years. The writer's need for rest is significant. They mention this has been going on for a long time, which implies it's a persistent problem not resolved by previous compromises.\n\nI should consider if there are other solutions. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 could use earplugs, or the couple could get a white noise machine. But the writer has tried asking, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't responsive, even sleeping through requests to lower the volume. The writer's mental and physical health is a priority here. Sacrificing sleep for the sake of a relationship might not be sustainable. \n\nSeparate rooms can be a practical solution in many relationships where sleep issues can't be resolved otherwise. The fianc\u00e9's resistance seems to be more about the symbolism of separate rooms rather than the actual issue. The writer isn't trying to end the relationship but to improve their quality of life. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They are prioritizing their health and well-being, which is reasonable.\n"
