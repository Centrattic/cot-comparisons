I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear when the volume is turned down, and this has been going on for years with two kids. The author finally had enough and suggested separate rooms.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The main issue is the sleep disturbance caused by the fianc\u00e9's habits. The author is prioritizing their health and well-being by trying to get proper sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a different sleep need, being a heavy sleeper and relying on TV noise.\n\nThe author has tried some compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the intimacy of sharing a bed and not wanting to be just roommates. But the author's need for rest is significant, especially with kids and a long-term relationship. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. It's possible that there's a middle ground, like using earplugs or white noise machines, but the author might have already tried those. If those solutions don't work, then separate rooms could be a reasonable solution. The author isn't suggesting ending the relationship, just adjusting their living arrangement for better health. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction might be coming from a place of not wanting to change the status quo, but the author's well-being is important. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution that benefits their health. The answer would be B (No).\n"
