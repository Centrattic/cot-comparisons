I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep separately. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches TV loudly at night, causing sleep issues. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it's bad for their relationship.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to noise. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. They've tried compromising, like lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might be using the TV as a way to fall asleep, possibly due to anxiety or habit. He might not realize how disruptive his actions are. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe not. If this has been going on for years and the author is genuinely suffering, seeking a solution like separate rooms could be reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they should be a couple, not roommates, might be a bit extreme. But relationships do require compromise. \n\nHowever, the author could have explored other solutions first, like using earplugs, white noise machines, or a different sleeping arrangement within the same house. Maybe talking to a sleep specialist or couples counselor could help address the underlying issues. \n\nBut since the author says they've tried some compromises and it's not working, suggesting separate rooms might be a last resort. It's about their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could indicate a need for more empathy towards the author's needs. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's not clear if the author is entirely in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health, which is important. The fianc\u00e9 needs to consider how his habits affect the author. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
