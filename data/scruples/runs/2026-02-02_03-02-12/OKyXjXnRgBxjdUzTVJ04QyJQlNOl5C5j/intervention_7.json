I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 has a heavy sleeper who can't sleep without loud TV, and the author is a light sleeper. The fianc\u00e9 is against the idea, saying if they can't share a bed, what's the point.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author has tried to compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author has been dealing with this for a long time, which adds to the stress. They have kids, which might mean their sleep is even more crucial for taking care of them.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that sleeping separately is a big step that might affect their relationship. He's arguing that if they can't share a bed, they're just roommates. But the author is prioritizing their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, so this isn't just about preference. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is affecting the author's quality of life.\n\nThe author tried to handle it before, but it's not working. They're engaging in a community (Reddit) to seek advice, which shows they're looking for solutions but also validation. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the symbolism of the bed-sharing rather than the practical issues. However, relationships do require compromise. But when one's health is at stake, it's a valid concern.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to solve a problem caused by the other person's behavior. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the main issue here. The author isn't being selfish; they're seeking a solution to a longstanding problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the relationship's dynamics than the actual problem. The author's request is reasonable if the other person isn't willing to change their habits to accommodate.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their well-being, and suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable step if all else fails.\n"
