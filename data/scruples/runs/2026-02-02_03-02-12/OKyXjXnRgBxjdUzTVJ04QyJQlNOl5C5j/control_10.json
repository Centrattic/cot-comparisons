I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV loudly. They've been dealing with this for years, and the kids are involved. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, then being a couple is pointless, comparing them to roommates.\n\nHmm. Well, first, the author's main issue is health and well-being due to lack of sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health problems. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this. The author is trying to find a solution that allows them to get rest. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive of the author's needs, focusing on the romantic aspect rather than the practical health issue.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9's point is about the relationship dynamic. However, relationships require compromise. The author is making a reasonable request for their health. The fianc\u00e9's solution (watching TV loudly) isn't working, and the author is looking for another way. Separate rooms could be a temporary or long-term fix. The author isn't suggesting breaking up, just adjusting their living arrangement for better sleep. It's about finding a balance between the two partners' needs.\n\nAlso, they've been together for 8 years, which suggests they know each other's habits. The fianc\u00e9 has the opportunity to adjust, like using earplugs or a white noise machine, but maybe they haven't tried those. However, if the author has already tried turning down the TV and the fianc\u00e9 still can't hear it, it's a recurring problem. The author isn't wrong to seek a solution that prioritizes their health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to conflate sleeping separately with the end of the relationship, which might be an overreaction. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
