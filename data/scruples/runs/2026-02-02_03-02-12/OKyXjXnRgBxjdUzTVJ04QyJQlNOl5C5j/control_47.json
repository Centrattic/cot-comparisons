I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper and the partner who snores a lot and watches loud TV shows before bed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for a year, two kids. They mention that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and can't hear if the TV is turned down. The fianc\u00e9 can't sleep without the TV on, which is loud and causes disturbances. The author is exhausted and can't sleep well anymore, leading them to propose separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, then the relationship isn't worth it. But the author just wants to sleep properly. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about mutual respect and trying to find solutions. The author tried to compromise (the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a little), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's habit is affecting the author's health and well-being. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should make efforts to accommodate each other's needs. However, when those accommodations are impossible (like the fianc\u00e9's need for loud TV and the author's need for silence), separate rooms can be a valid solution. The author isn't trying to end the relationship but to improve their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be overblown, as suggesting separate rooms isn't necessarily a rejection of the relationship. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They've tried and the situation is unsustainable. The answer is B.\n"
