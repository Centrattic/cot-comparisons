I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through their situation carefully. They're engaged and have been together for 8 years with two kids. They mentioned they're a light sleeper and want a quiet room, but their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and sleeps with the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to adjust much, and the author is exhausted from the poor sleep. They decided to suggest sleeping in separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted by the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own sleep habits that he might not be able to control, like snoring. He's also using the TV as a sleep aid, which is a common thing people do, but it's causing conflict here.\n\nThe author tried to compromise by asking the fianc\u00e9 to lower the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response in sleep suggests he's not conscious of the issue when it's happening. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which is a drastic step but might be necessary for their well-being. \n\nNow, considering relationships: communication is key. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally had enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument that sleeping separately would make them just roommates might come from feeling that the problem is a deal-breaker. However, the author's primary need for rest is important. \n\nI should think about whether there are other solutions they've tried. The author mentions the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a bit, but not enough. Maybe they could explore other solutions like white noise machines, earplugs, or even medical solutions for the snoring (like a CPAP machine if it's severe). However, the author might have already tried these and found them ineffective. \n\nThe author's action is about their health and well-being. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to adapt in any other way, then the author's choice to sleep separately isn't unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be about feeling rejected, but the author isn't trying to end the relationship; they just need better sleep. \n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other's needs. If one partner's habits are causing significant distress, the other is within their rights to demand changes. Since the author has tried compromising and it's not working, suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable step. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their health and well-being after long-term issues that haven't been resolved through compromise. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's quality of life, and the solution is a personal choice to seek better rest.\n"
