I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 having a heavy sleep style that disrupts their rest. The fianc\u00e9 sleeps with the TV on loud, which the author can't tolerate. The author, a light sleeper, has been struggling with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep, which is important for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various issues, so the author's frustration is valid. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are deeply ingrained, and he might not be aware of how disruptive they are. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he values the shared sleeping arrangement as part of their relationship dynamic, seeing separate rooms as akin to just being roommates.\n\nBut the key points here are the impact on the author's health and the duration of the problem. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, with 1 year of engagement. It's a long-standing issue that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's willingness to compromise is minimal\u2014only lowering the volume by 3 points, which isn't enough. The author's decision to seek a separate room is a last resort after trying to adjust for so long.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. However, when one partner's needs are significantly affecting their health, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed seems to miss the point. Being roommates doesn't preclude a loving relationship, and the author's need for rest is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 should be more considerate and maybe explore other solutions, like a white noise machine, different sleep schedules, or even medical consultation for snoring.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to a restful sleep and have given their partner time to adjust without success. The fianc\u00e9's resistance is causing more harm, making him the one at fault here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
