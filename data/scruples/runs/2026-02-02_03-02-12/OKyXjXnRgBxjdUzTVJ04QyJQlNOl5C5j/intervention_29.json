I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and watches loud TV every night, which affects the author's sleep. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise. After years of this, they decide to sleep separately.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is clearly suffering from poor sleep due to their partner's habits. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to make enough effort to adjust, even though he sometimes lowers the volume a little. The author's request is about their basic need for rest, which is important for health and well-being. They've tried enduring it for years but have had enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately undermines their relationship, comparing it to being roommates. However, the author is trying to find a solution that works for both. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. Sleeping in separate rooms is a common compromise in relationships with significant lifestyle differences. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm to the author's health, so seeking a solution isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe author's reasoning is valid. They've given examples of the problem and their attempts to resolve it. The fianc\u00e9 isn't making sufficient compromises. The author's action is about self-care, which is essential. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
