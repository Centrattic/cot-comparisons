I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The post details that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The author is a light sleeper, so this setup has been causing them sleep issues for years. They finally suggested separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for wanting better sleep\u2014health and well-being are important. Long-term sleep deprivation can affect their quality of life, which is a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive, and the author has tried compromising (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit). However, the fianc\u00e9 seems resistant to change, even sleeping through attempts to adjust the volume. \n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9's perspective: he might feel that the suggestion to sleep separately is a rejection or a step back from their committed relationship. He might see sharing a bed as a fundamental part of being a couple. But is that a fair argument? While sharing a bed is traditional, it's not a universal requirement. Relationships should be about mutual respect and finding solutions that work for both partners. If the current situation is harmful to the author's health, then adjusting the sleeping arrangements might be necessary for the relationship's long-term health.\n\nThe duration of the relationship (8 years together, engaged for 1) and having kids suggests that they've been together a long time. The author has been putting up with this for a long time, which might indicate that they've tried to make the relationship work but now feel it's affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about the symbolism of separate rooms than the actual issue of the TV and snoring. \n\nPossible solutions could involve finding a middle ground, like using earplugs or white noise machines, but the author might find those ineffective. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to find a compromise, then the author's decision to prioritize their own needs is understandable. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't wrong to seek a solution for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9 is also not entirely in the right for dismissing the author's concerns as just being about the bed. The core issue is about differing needs and communication. The author isn't being unreasonable by suggesting separate rooms if it's the only way to get restful sleep. So, the answer is B.\n"
