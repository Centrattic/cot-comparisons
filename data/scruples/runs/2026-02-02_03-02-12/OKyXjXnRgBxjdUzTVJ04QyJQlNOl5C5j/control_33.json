I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and likes to watch loud action movies on TV at night, which disturbs the author who is a light sleeper. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a legitimate need for quiet to sleep well, which is essential for their health and well-being. Chronic sleep disruption can cause various issues like fatigue, stress, and even health problems. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and he's not making significant adjustments despite some minor volume changes. The author has tried compromising but it's not working.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, not a couple. This might touch on his feelings about their relationship commitment. However, the relationship already has two kids, so they're in a long-term partnership. The author isn't suggesting ending the relationship, just improving their living arrangement to prioritize their health.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to a good night's sleep versus the fianc\u00e9's perspective on the relationship dynamics. Since the author has been dealing with this for 8 years and it's affecting their quality of life, it's reasonable for them to seek a solution. Sleeping separately isn't necessarily a rejection of the relationship but a practical step for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about how he perceives the situation rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to address a real problem that's affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9 should be more considerate and find a middle ground, but the author's action is justified. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
