I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the author significant sleep disturbances. After years of this, the author suggests sleeping separately. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, feeling that sharing a bed is essential for their relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. Both partners have needs. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid, especially given that they've been dealing with this for years. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 also has his habits that he's unwilling to change much. \n\nThe author has tried to compromise by having the fianc\u00e9 lower the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response is to argue that they might as well be roommates, which seems dismissive of the author's legitimate issue. The author's decision to prioritize their health and well-being by seeking a separate room isn't unreasonable. In long-term relationships, especially when there are children involved, maintaining individual well-being is crucial. \n\nIt's possible the author could have approached it differently, maybe with more discussion or exploring other solutions first, but the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to change. The author's action is a last resort after enduring years of poor sleep. So, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution to a valid problem.\n"
