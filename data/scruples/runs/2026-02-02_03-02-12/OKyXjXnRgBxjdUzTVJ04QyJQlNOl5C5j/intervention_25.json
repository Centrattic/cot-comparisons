I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're engaged, have two kids, and been together for eight years. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 wants to sleep in the same room with the TV on loudly because of his heavy sleeping and snoring. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise, leading to bad sleep. They suggested moving to separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not a good idea for a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic poor sleep can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. He does make some effort to lower the volume a bit, but not enough for the author. The author mentions that even when the volume is lowered, the TV is still too loud. So, the compromise isn't sufficient.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, then what's the point of being a couple. That seems a bit extreme. Not sharing a bed doesn't mean the relationship is over. Many couples have different sleeping arrangements for various reasons\u2014like medical issues, work schedules, or just personal preferences. It's about finding a solution that works for both.\n\nThe author tried to accommodate by lowering the volume, but it's not working. The situation has been going on for eight years, which is a long time. The author's frustration is understandable. They've been dealing with this for a long time and are now taking action to improve their sleep. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might indicate that he hasn't fully considered the impact of his habits on the author's well-being.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to change his habits, maybe the author's solution is necessary for their health. The key is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since the fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing significant distress and the author is seeking a solution, it's not unreasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a legitimate issue that's affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9's resistance seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the severity of the problem. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
