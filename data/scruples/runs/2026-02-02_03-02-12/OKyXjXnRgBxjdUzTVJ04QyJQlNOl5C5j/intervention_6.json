I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and watches loud TV while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't respond to volume adjustments, leading to the author's sleep issues. They've been dealing with this for years, and now the author is frustrated enough to suggest separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 reacts negatively, saying it's not worth being a couple if they can't share a bed.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down. The key factors here are the impact on the author's well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can be serious, affecting mood, health, and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and despite some compromises (like lowering the volume a bit), the problem persists. The author is trying to find a solution to get proper rest, which is a basic need.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, which is a valid emotional concern. But the author's health and well-being are also important. If the fianc\u00e9 is truly asleep with the TV on, maybe he's not aware of the disturbance. Or maybe he's making a conscious choice that affects the author negatively. The author's request is reasonable for their health. The fianc\u00e9 not waking up when the volume is lowered suggests that the compromise isn't working. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main question is whether the action taken was justified. The author's action is to protect their own health and happiness, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the relationship dynamic rather than the author's right to a good night's sleep. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a long-term problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root issue here, not the author's suggestion to move. So the answer should be B.\n"
