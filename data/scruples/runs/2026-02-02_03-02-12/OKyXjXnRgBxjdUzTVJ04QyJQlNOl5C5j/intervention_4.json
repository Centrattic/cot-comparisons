I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows. They've been dealing with this for a long time, eight years together with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to compromise much; he lowers the volume a little but still watches action movies with loud sounds. The author is frustrated and wants a good sleep, so they suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main issue is their health and well-being. Chronic poor sleep can lead to various health problems, so prioritizing that is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing ongoing distress. Even though they've been together eight years, the fianc\u00e9 hasn't made significant changes. The author tried compromising by suggesting a separate room, which is a reasonable solution. The fianc\u00e9's response seems more about the emotional aspect of not sharing a bed rather than addressing the problem. \n\nBut relationships require mutual compromise. Maybe the author didn't try other solutions first, like using earplugs or white noise machines. However, the fianc\u00e9's TV habit is so disruptive that even those might not help. The author's request to sleep apart is a last resort after years of trying. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed is a bit extreme, as couples can have separate sleeping arrangements for various reasons (like different schedules, health issues, etc.). \n\nThe key points are: long-term problem, attempts at compromise by the author, the fianc\u00e9's lack of adaptability, and the impact on the author's well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a solution to a legitimate problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the emotional aspect than addressing the actual issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
