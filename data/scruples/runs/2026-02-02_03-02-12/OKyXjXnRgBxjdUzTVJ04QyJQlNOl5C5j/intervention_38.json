I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy snorer who watches action movies with loud explosions and stuff on TV while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV when it's too low, so he keeps the volume high. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, engaged for 1, and has two kids. They finally had enough and told him to sleep in a different room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a medical condition (heavy snoring) and a habit of sleeping with the TV on, which might be a comfort or a necessity for him. \n\nThe author is asking if suggesting separate rooms is reasonable. From a relationship perspective, there are expectations of sharing a bed. But there's also the practical aspect of health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's snoring isn't something he can control, and the TV volume is a compromise. The author tried to lower the volume a bit, but it's not enough. \n\nIn such cases, people often look for solutions. Maybe trying earplugs or a white noise machine could help, but if those don't work, then separate rooms might be a last resort. The author's frustration is understandable after 8 years. They might be in the right because their need for restful sleep is valid. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel it's a rejection, thinking that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of the relationship. \n\nBut the author's request is for their own well-being, not to distance themselves. So the answer would likely be No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason and it's a common solution in long-term relationships when other methods fail. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 could look into snoring solutions or the author could try a sleep mask and earplugs, but if those aren't working, separate rooms can be a practical choice. The author's health and the kids' well-being might also be factors. So I think the answer is B.\n"
