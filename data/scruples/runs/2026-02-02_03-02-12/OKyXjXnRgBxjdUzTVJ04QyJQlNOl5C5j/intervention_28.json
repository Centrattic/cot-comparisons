I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms because of their partner's loud snoring and TV habits. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time. They mention that their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, can't hear the TV unless it's loud, and plays action movies with explosions and loud sounds. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to be making enough effort to compromise, even though he sometimes lowers the volume a bit. The author is frustrated and wants good sleep, so they proposed separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea because they can't share a bed and might just be roommates otherwise.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is about their health and well-being, needing proper sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's side is that he's not aware of the problem while sleeping, and he's making some compromises by lowering the volume a bit. However, the author feels that the compromises aren't enough and that the problem persists for years. \n\nIn relationships, mutual compromise is key. The fianc\u00e9 isn't addressing the root issue\u2014his snoring and the TV volume. While he lowers the volume a little, it's not solving the problem. The author is seeking a solution that prioritizes their health. Suggesting separate rooms is a drastic step, but if the other person isn't willing to find alternative solutions (like earplugs, a white noise machine, different sleep schedules), then maybe it's necessary. The author has been dealing with this for eight years, so it's not a new issue. The fianc\u00e9's argument that sleeping separately would make them just roommates is more about his perspective rather than the author's need for rest. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person's well-being is a valid concern. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make reasonable accommodations, the author isn't wrong to seek a solution that works for them. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
