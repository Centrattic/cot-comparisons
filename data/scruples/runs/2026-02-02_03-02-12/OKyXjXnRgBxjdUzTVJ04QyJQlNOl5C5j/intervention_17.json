I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows and snores a lot, disturbing the author's sleep. The author is a light sleeper and has tried to compromise but is now suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's against the point of being a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to the partner's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. They've mentioned this has been going on for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for 1, with kids. So, this is a long-standing problem that hasn't been resolved through compromises.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side is that he's a heavy sleeper, can't hear the TV unless it's loud, and he's not aware when he's being disruptive. He's also suggesting that separate rooms might make them just roommates. However, the author is prioritizing their health and comfort, which is understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author tried to compromise by letting the TV be on but it's still too loud, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't aware when it's turned down. The author's breaking point is understandable. Suggesting separate rooms is a solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about the principle of sharing a bedroom, but the author's need for sleep is a valid concern.\n\nIn relationships, partners need to accommodate each other's needs. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust his habits after years, maybe separate rooms are necessary. The author isn't being unreasonable. They're seeking a solution to a problem that's impacting their health. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
