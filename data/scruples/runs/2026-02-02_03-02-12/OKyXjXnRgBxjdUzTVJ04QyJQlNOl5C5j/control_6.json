I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for suggesting separate rooms to their fianc\u00e9. The main issue is about the author's need for a quiet sleep environment versus the fianc\u00e9's habits of snoring loudly and watching TV at high volume.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. They're a light sleeper and have been dealing with this for eight years, which is a long time. Sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent disruption. The author mentions that they tried to compromise before, but the fianc\u00e9's response is to get upset in his sleep if the volume is turned down. The author's decision to sleep separately is a last resort after enduring this for so long.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 argues that separate rooms would make them just roommates. That's a valid concern because shared living spaces are common in relationships. However, the fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here. The author's request is about their well-being, not about rejecting the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's inability to adapt or find a solution (like using earplugs or a white noise machine) might be his own issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they have two kids. Parenting requires good rest for both parents, so the stress of poor sleep could affect parenting. The fianc\u00e9's actions are affecting the whole family's environment, not just the author's.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have tried other solutions first, like a sleep mask, earplugs, or a different room setup. However, given the duration and the fianc\u00e9's resistance to change, the author's frustration is justified. The key point is that the author is seeking a solution to a legitimate problem caused by the fianc\u00e9's behavior.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author did communicate their needs, and when that didn't work, they took action. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their health. Relationships require compromise, but both parties need to meet each other's needs. If the fianc\u00e9 can't adjust his habits, the author's decision to sleep separately isn't unreasonable.\n"
