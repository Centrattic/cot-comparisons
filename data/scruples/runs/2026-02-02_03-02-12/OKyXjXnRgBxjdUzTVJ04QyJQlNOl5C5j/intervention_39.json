I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows and snores loudly. The author is tired of poor sleep and decides to sleep in a separate room. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea and questioning the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted. They've been dealing with this for a long time, especially with two kids, which adds to the stress. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a habit of watching loud TV, which he can't seem to adjust even when he tries to lower the volume slightly. He also snores a lot, which is another disturbance.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The author is asking for their needs to be considered, which is a valid request. Chronic lack of sleep can have serious health implications, so it's understandable why the author would be frustrated. The fianc\u00e9's response, however, seems to minimize the problem by suggesting that not sharing a bed would negate the relationship's purpose. That might be a bit of a knee-jerk reaction and not addressing the real issue.\n\nI should consider if the author's solution is reasonable. Sleeping in separate rooms is a common compromise in relationships where there are significant differences in sleep habits. It's a practical solution that addresses the immediate problem without necessarily indicating a lack of commitment to the relationship. The fact that they've been together for eight years and engaged for a year shows that the author has tried to work through the issue over a long period. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling attacked or not considering the long-term impact of his sleep habits on the author's well-being.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author could have tried other solutions first. Maybe they could have discussed it more calmly, tried noise-canceling solutions, or adjusted their sleeping schedules. However, the author mentions that they've tried some compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not sufficient. The situation has been ongoing for a long time, and the author has reached a breaking point. In that case, suggesting a separate room is a reasonable step to prioritize their health and well-being.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction might also reflect deeper issues in the relationship. If he's defensive and dismissive of the author's needs, that could indicate a pattern of not valuing the author's comfort. On the other hand, the author needs to communicate their needs clearly and work on finding a solution that both can agree on, but given the circumstances, sleeping separately is a valid option.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being in a situation that's been causing long-term stress and sleep deprivation. The fianc\u00e9's response seems more about relationship dynamics than the actual sleep issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
