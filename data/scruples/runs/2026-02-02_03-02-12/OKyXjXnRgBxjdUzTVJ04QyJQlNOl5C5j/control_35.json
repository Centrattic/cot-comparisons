I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper who can't stand noise. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on watching loud movies on TV at night. This has been going on for years, with the fianc\u00e9 not really making enough compromises. The author is now frustrated and wants separate rooms for better sleep, but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a relationship issue, comparing it to just being roommates.\n\nSo, the key points here are the impact on the author's well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, stress, and other problems. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing direct harm to the author's quality of life. The author has tried to communicate their needs, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't responsive enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument about the relationship being just roommates if they don't share a bed seems to misunderstand the core issue here. The author isn't rejecting the relationship; they're seeking a solution to a practical problem that's affecting their health.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other factors. The fianc\u00e9 might have his own reasons for needing the TV on, maybe it's a habit or a coping mechanism. However, the author has been dealing with this for 8 years and even after being engaged for a year. The fianc\u00e9's willingness to lower the volume only by 3 points (which might not be significant) shows minimal effort. The author's request for separate rooms is a drastic measure, but given the long-term issue and the health impact, it's understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also valid in the sense that sharing a bed is a common expectation in a relationship. But the author's need for good sleep is non-negotiable for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's about being a couple versus roommates might be more about his feelings of rejection than the actual living situation. The author's priority is health, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't being unreasonable. They've tried to accommodate but to no avail. The fianc\u00e9 isn't meeting their partner's basic needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
