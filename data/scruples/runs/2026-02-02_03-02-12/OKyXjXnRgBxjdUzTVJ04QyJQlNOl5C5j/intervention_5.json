I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a long-term engaged couple with kids. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud movies at night. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if it's too low, so the author ends up sleep-deprived.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has tried to compromise by turning the volume down a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9 is so used to the noise that he can't sleep without it. The author's health and well-being are at stake here because their sleep is constantly disrupted. Chronic sleep issues can lead to serious health problems, so that's a significant factor.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the relationship's validity if they can't share a bed. But relationships are about mutual respect and meeting each other's needs. If the current setup is unsustainable, finding a solution is necessary. The author's request for separate rooms is a drastic measure, but if other compromises haven't worked, maybe it's a reasonable step to ensure their well-being and that of the kids (since they have two young children).\n\nThe engagement suggests a long-term commitment, but if the fianc\u00e9 is resistant to finding alternative solutions (like earplugs or white noise machines), then the author's frustration is justified. The key here is whether both parties are willing to adapt. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to change his habits, the author's decision to seek separate rooms isn't necessarily inconsiderate but a necessary action for their own health.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to communicate and compromise, and the fianc\u00e9's resistance is making the situation untenable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
