I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted about suggesting separate rooms is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper, and the partner is a heavy sleeper who uses a TV at loud volume. The fianc\u00e9 can't sleep well and has had enough, so they suggested separate rooms. The partner is upset, thinking it's bad for the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to get rest because of noise. It's been 8 years, which is a long time. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's partner's habits (snoring, TV volume) are affecting this. The author is prioritizing their health, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner might feel that the suggestion of separate rooms is a break from physical intimacy or a sign of not wanting to be close. The partner's argument is that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple. That's a common fear in relationships where physical presence is part of the bond.\n\nBut the author has been dealing with this for years. Maybe they've tried compromises, like adjusting the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's request is reasonable because everyone deserves a good night's sleep. The key here is whether the author acted inconsiderately or if their needs are valid. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by lowering the volume a few points, but it's still too loud. The partner's habits are causing significant disruption. In relationships, both partners need to meet in the middle. However, when one's needs are severely impacting their health, it's reasonable to seek a solution that protects their well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a long-standing issue that affects their quality of life. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling hurt, but the author's action is about self-care. Therefore, answer B.\n"
