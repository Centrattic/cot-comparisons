I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snorts loudly and watches TV at a high volume. The author has tried to address this before, but the situation is getting worse, leading them to propose separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to get a good night's sleep due to their partner's habits. Chronic lack of sleep can have serious health consequences, so this is a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own preferences and sees sleeping in separate rooms as undermining their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the length of the relationship (8 years together, engaged for 1 year, two kids) and the fact that the problem has been ongoing. The author mentions they've tried to compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's frustration is valid because their sleep is constantly disrupted, leading to \"shitty sleeps\" every night. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But in long-term relationships, especially with children, practical compromises are necessary. The author's health and well-being are important, and if the situation isn't improving, the author's request is reasonable. \n\nI think the author is justified in seeking a solution that prioritizes their health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here, and the author isn't the one causing the problem. While relationships do require some level of shared space, there's a balance between being considerate and maintaining one's own needs. The author isn't being inconsiderate by seeking a separate room; they're trying to find a sustainable solution for both partners' well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason and have tried to address the issue without success. The fianc\u00e9's response seems more about the principle of sharing a bed rather than addressing the actual problem of the author's disrupted sleep. The author's health and the children's well-being are important factors that support their decision.\n"
