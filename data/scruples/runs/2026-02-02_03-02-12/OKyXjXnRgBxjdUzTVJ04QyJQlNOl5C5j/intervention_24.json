I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AMA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a long-term relationship with two kids, where the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and uses the TV at a loud volume, which is causing the author significant sleep issues.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring loudly and sleeping with the TV on\u2014directly interfere with the author's sleep. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to be responsive to compromises, like lowering the TV volume slightly. The author's breaking point came after years of this, leading them to propose separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is that they should just be roommates if they can't share a bed. But the author's main concern is their well-being and health, which can be severely affected by poor sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, and it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their health.\n\nConsidering the duration of the problem (8 years together, 1 engaged), it's clear this has been an ongoing issue. The author has tried to accommodate the fianc\u00e9's preferences but hasn't found a solution that works for both. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on the TV at a loud volume and his heavy snoring aren't something the author can control, so suggesting a separate room is a practical solution to their incompatibility in sleeping habits.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument about the point of being a couple vs. roommates seems dismissive of the author's needs. Relationships require compromise on both sides. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to adjust his habits to accommodate his partner's basic need for rest, then the problem isn't with the author for seeking a solution. The author isn't looking to end the relationship but to improve their quality of life.\n\nIn relationships, especially with children involved, both partners' health and well-being are crucial. The author's request is about creating a sustainable living environment where both can function well. It's not unreasonable to seek a separate sleeping arrangement when shared space is causing harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for suggesting this change.\n"
