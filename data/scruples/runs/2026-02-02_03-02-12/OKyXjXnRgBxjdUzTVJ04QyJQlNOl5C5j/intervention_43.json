I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The context given is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV, and the author is a light sleeper. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is sleep deprivation due to their partner's habits. They mention that their partner can't hear the TV if it's turned down, even in sleep, which complicates things. The partner is against the idea, arguing that separate rooms would make them just roommates. The author wants better sleep, which is a basic need. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might have tried to address the issue before, but if compromise isn't working, suggesting separate rooms could be a reasonable step. However, the partner's reaction is also a valid concern. Relationships require mutual effort, and the author's decision might be seen as a last resort. \n\nBut considering the long-term effects of poor sleep on health and well-being, the author's request isn't unreasonable. The partner's habits are affecting the author's quality of life. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is seeking a solution to a legitimate problem. However, it's important to consider if there were other compromises that could have been made first. But given the duration and the lack of effective solutions, the author's stance makes sense.\n"
