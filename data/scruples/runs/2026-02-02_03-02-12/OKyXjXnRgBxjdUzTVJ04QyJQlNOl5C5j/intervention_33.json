I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about sleeping arrangements. The author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who also snores a lot and insists on having the TV on at a loud volume. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years plus an engagement year, and now they're suggesting sleeping in separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to noise, which is understandable. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and relationships. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is used to his sleeping habits and sees the TV as a way to fall asleep. He might feel that the author is overreacting or not considering his needs.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, they might as well be roommates. That's a common counter-argument, implying that the core of the relationship is being compromised. But the author's need for a good night's sleep is also valid. They've tried compromises like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's breaking point after 8 years shows that this isn't a new issue but a long-standing problem.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Asking to sleep in separate rooms isn't about avoiding the relationship but about health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. The author isn't being selfish; they're seeking a solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling accused or not being understood, but the author's need is legitimate.\n\nSo, considering the long-term effects of poor sleep and the fact that the author is trying to communicate their needs, I don't think they're in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 should be open to finding solutions, maybe like white noise machines or different sleep schedules, but the author isn't at fault for seeking relief after years of struggling.\n"
