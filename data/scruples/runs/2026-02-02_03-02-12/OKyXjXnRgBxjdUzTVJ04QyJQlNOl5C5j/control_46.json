I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows while sleeping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is sleep disruption. The author wants quiet, but the fianc\u00e9's TV volume is too high, even after some compromise. They've been in this situation for a long time with two kids, which adds stress. The author's request seems reasonable for their well-being, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nNow, I should evaluate both sides. The author has a legitimate need for restful sleep, which is essential for health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting that. However, moving to separate rooms is a significant step. Is there a middle ground? Maybe trying earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV setup? But the author mentions they've tried lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could also be a red flag if he's dismissive of her needs. The author's point about being in the relationship for 8 years and having kids shows they've put in a lot, but their sleep issues are chronic. \n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing their health? Probably not. Chronic lack of sleep can lead to health problems, so seeking a solution is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates might be a fear of change or not valuing her needs. The author isn't suggesting ending the relationship, just adjusting their living situation to improve their quality of life. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue that's been ongoing. The answer should be B.\n"
