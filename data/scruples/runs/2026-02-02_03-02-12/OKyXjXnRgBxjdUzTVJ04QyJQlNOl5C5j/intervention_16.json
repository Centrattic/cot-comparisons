I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple sleeping in separate rooms because of sleep issues.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV at high volume. The author can't get a good night's sleep, leading to the suggestion of separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not worth being a couple if they can't share a bed.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for rest, especially with two kids and being engaged. Chronic sleep deprivation can be serious. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health and well-being. The author tried to compromise before, like turning down the TV a bit, but it's not enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting or not making enough effort. Maybe he's not aware of how loud the TV is or the impact on the author. But the author has been dealing with this for years, so it's a long-standing issue.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems dismissive. The author is seeking a solution, not wanting to end the relationship. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The author's intent is to improve their sleep, which is a basic need. It's a reasonable request given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not understanding the severity.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to find a solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more accommodating or find a middle ground. The answer should be B.\n"
