I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The scenario is that the author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV, and the author can't take it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author has tried to tolerate it for 8 years, which seems like a long time. The fianc\u00e9 argues that separate rooms would make them just roommates, but they're engaged with two kids, so they're committed to each other long-term.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing their health? Probably not. Chronic sleep issues can affect mental and physical health. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is problematic here. He's not making reasonable accommodations. Lowering the volume a little isn't enough. The author is seeking a solution, not being unreasonable.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit weak. Couples often have separate rooms for various reasons, like different sleep schedules or medical issues. It doesn't negate the relationship. The key is that they're both looking for a solution that works for both. The author is trying to find a compromise to improve their quality of life.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and have tried to adjust as much as possible. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more considerate. Answer is B.\n"
