I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves their fianc\u00e9's heavy snoring, loud TV habits, and the author's need for a quiet environment to sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for 8 years. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, can't hear when the TV is too quiet, and insists on having it on. The author tried to compromise, lowering the volume a bit, but it's still causing them to lose sleep. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is affecting their health and well-being, which is significant.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they need a good night's sleep and can't achieve it with the current setup. They suggest separate rooms as a solution. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, sees this as a problem in the relationship, implying that if they can't share a bed, maybe their relationship isn't valid. But the author is focusing on their own health and the long-term effects of chronic sleep deprivation.\n\nNow, looking at possible angles. Is the author being selfish? Well, the fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health. They've tried to make compromises, but it's not enough. The author's request for separate rooms is a last resort after years of trying. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with romantic commitment, which might be a misunderstanding. \n\nAnother angle: Is there a middle ground? Maybe they could find a solution like a white noise machine, earplugs, or a different TV setup. But the author has tried some compromises already. The fianc\u00e9's TV volume is still too loud despite some adjustments. The author's health is a priority, and chronic sleep issues can lead to other health problems. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9 might need to be more considerate of the author's needs. The author's decision is a reasonable step to improve their quality of life. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
