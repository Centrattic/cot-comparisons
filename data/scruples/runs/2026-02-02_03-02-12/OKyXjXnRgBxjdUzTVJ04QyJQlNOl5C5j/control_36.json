I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The scenario is that the fianc\u00e9 wants quiet, the husband is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and the fianc\u00e9 is tired of not sleeping well. They've been together a long time, have kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's need for rest is important. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. The husband's habits are clearly disruptive. The fianc\u00e9 has tried compromising, like adjusting the TV volume a little, but it's not enough. After 8 years, this is a recurring issue that's causing significant stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, not a couple. There's an emotional aspect here. But the fianc\u00e9's health and their long-term marriage might be more critical. The fact that they have kids adds another layer; the parent needs to be well-rested for the kids too. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 isn't suggesting leaving the relationship but seeking a practical solution for sleep. Separate rooms are a common solution in many relationships when there's a sleep issue. So, from that perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health and marital longevity by addressing a problem that's been unresolved for years. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling accused, but the root issue is his sleep habits affecting the partner. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a step to improve their quality of life and the marriage by addressing a long-standing problem.\n"
