I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The key points here are the couple's differences in sleeping habits and the impact on their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on having the TV on pretty loudly. This has been going on for years, which is causing significant sleep issues for the author. The author finally had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling it undermines their relationship, comparing it to being roommates instead of a couple. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The author has been dealing with this for a long time.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's need for good sleep is legitimate. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. While the author's solution is to separate, maybe there's a middle ground they haven't considered yet. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting this. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that not sharing a room means there's no point in being a couple. That's a bit of a red flag. A healthy relationship should accommodate each other's needs without forcing one to sacrifice their well-being. The author isn't asking to end the relationship; they just want a solution to a practical problem. Suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable step if they can't find another compromise. The fact that they've been dealing with this for years without resolution points to a deeper issue in communication or prioritization of each other's needs. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached this differently. Maybe explored other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV setup. But given that they tried a few times (like lowering the volume a bit), and it's not working, the author's frustration is valid. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems dismissive of the author's needs, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to seek a solution to a problem that's affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9's resistance seems more about the symbolism of separate rooms rather than addressing the root issue. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
