I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and it's affecting their sleep. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for 8 years. They just had enough and suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted. Chronic lack of good sleep can have health effects, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits (loud TV, snoring) are causing the problem. The author tried to compromise before, like turning down the volume a bit, but it's not enough. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong for wanting separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side is that they can't share a bed, so what's the point of being a couple? That reaction seems a bit extreme. It sounds like they're not considering the author's well-being. The author has been patient for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9's argument that separate rooms would make them just roommates is a bit odd because being in separate rooms doesn't negate the relationship. Many couples have this arrangement for various reasons, like different schedules or health issues.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response seems more focused on the relationship's structure rather than solving the problem. The author has tried to find compromises, but the problem persists. Suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution to a long-standing issue. The fianc\u00e9 should be more understanding and work on finding a solution together rather than dismissing the author's needs. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
