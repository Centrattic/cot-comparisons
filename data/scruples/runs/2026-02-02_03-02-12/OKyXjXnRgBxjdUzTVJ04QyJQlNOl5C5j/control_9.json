I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the engaged couple sleeping in separate rooms because of differing sleep habits.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the author significant sleep issues, leading to the suggestion to sleep separately. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea for a couple to not share a bed.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are the impact on the author's health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health consequences. The author has been dealing with this for years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, while perhaps habitual, isn't considering the partner's needs. The author's request for a separate room is to improve their own sleep, which is a valid health concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sharing a bed is important for the relationship. However, relationships also require mutual respect and compromise. If one partner's habits are causing harm, it's reasonable to seek a solution that benefits both. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't made significant changes despite the author's complaints. Lowering the volume by 3 points isn't enough, and turning it off leads to waking up in sleep. It seems like the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adapt, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's decision is a last resort after years of poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is also valid, as separation can be emotionally significant. However, the author's health and well-being are crucial. It's possible that there are middle grounds, like sleep masks, white noise machines, or earplugs, but if those aren't effective, separate rooms might be necessary.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both partners' perspectives but prioritizes health issues. Since the author is seeking a solution to a legitimate problem caused by the fianc\u00e9's unchanging behavior, the author is not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is not showing enough flexibility. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
