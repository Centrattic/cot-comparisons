I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a fianc\u00e9 who's been with their partner for 8 years, engaged for 1, and they have two kids. They're a light sleeper and need a quiet room. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and sleeps with the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a bit but still plays action movies with loud sounds. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested sleeping in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being together instead of roommates. The author wants better sleep.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's need for good sleep is a legitimate health concern. Chronic poor sleep can affect overall well-being, mood, and physical health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and the author has tried to compromise (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. The author has been enduring this for a long time, which adds to the stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 argues that separate rooms mean they're just roommates. But the main issue here is the author's need for a good night's sleep. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing harm to the author's well-being. The fact that the author has tried to communicate and even compromised before suggests they're not being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to dismiss the author's needs, focusing on the relationship dynamic rather than addressing the actual problem.\n\nAlso, considering the long-term relationship and the presence of children, maintaining good health is crucial. If the author can't get restful sleep, it might affect their ability to care for the kids and manage the relationship. The suggestion to sleep separately isn't just about avoiding the fianc\u00e9 but about improving quality of life.\n\nI don't see any evidence that the author is the one causing the problem. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause. The author is taking a step to protect their health, which is a valid action. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect of the relationship rather than the practical issue of sleep. So, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize their health and well-being.\n"
