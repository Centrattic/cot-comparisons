I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper, and their partner is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows while sleeping. The partner doesn't want to compromise, and the author is frustrated after 8 years together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main issue is their sleep being disturbed by their partner's habits. They've tried compromising, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The partner's response is emotional, suggesting that separate rooms would make them just roommates. The author's request is about their well-being, which is valid because sleep is crucial for health.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's habits are deeply ingrained. Maybe they've tried to adjust, but not enough. The author's frustration has built up over years, which is a long time. The partner's argument about being a couple vs. roommates is a bit of an emotional appeal, but it shouldn't overshadow the author's need for rest, especially with two kids involved.\n\nI should check if there are any other factors. The author mentions they're engaged, so they're planning a long-term future. If they can't find a middle ground, separate rooms might be a practical solution. The partner's refusal to adjust might indicate a lack of consideration for the author's needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being unreasonable. They are seeking a solution to a long-standing problem affecting their health. The partner's resistance is part of the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being, which is important. The answer should be B (No).\n"
