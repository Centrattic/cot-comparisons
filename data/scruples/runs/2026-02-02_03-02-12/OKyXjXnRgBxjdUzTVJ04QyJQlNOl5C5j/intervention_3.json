I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation on Reddit) is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is engaged, has been with their partner for 8 years, engaged for a year, and they have two kids. The main issue is their sleep habits. The author is a light sleeper, needs a quiet environment, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV at a loud volume, and snores loudly. This causes the author to have poor sleep. The author suggested sleeping in separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nNow, to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the impact on the author's well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this. The author has tried to communicate and compromise (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the TV volume a bit) but it's not enough. The author's request is about their health and peace, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, which is a relationship issue. However, the author has been dealing with this for a long time, so it's not a new problem. \n\nI think the author is justified in prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about the symbolic aspect of sharing a bed rather than the actual problem. The author isn't trying to end the relationship but to improve their quality of life. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
