I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms. The main issue here is the couple's sleep habits conflicting. The author is a light sleeper and gets disturbed by the fianc\u00e9's loud TV and snoring. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on for sleep and can't hear when the volume is turned down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. Chronic lack of sleep can have health implications, so the author's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's response that separate rooms would make them just roommates is a common argument, but it's also a bit dismissive of the author's needs. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could try different solutions like a white noise machine, earplugs, or a sleep mask. But the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 sometimes compromises a little, which isn't enough. If those solutions have been tried and failed, then separate rooms might be the only option left. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he might not see the problem as severe as the author does. However, the author's priority is their own health and well-being. It's important to note that relationships require mutual accommodation, but there's a limit when one's needs are causing significant harm to the other. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution that prioritizes their health. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be due to not understanding the impact of his habits. The author's decision is a last resort after years of struggle. So I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
