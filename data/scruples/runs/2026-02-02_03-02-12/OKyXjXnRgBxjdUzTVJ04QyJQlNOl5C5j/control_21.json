I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, have two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper needing a quiet environment, while the other person is a heavy sleeper who watches loud movies on TV at half volume and can't hear it when it's turned down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, the relationship might as well be just roommates. But the author just wants a good night's sleep and has been dealing with this for a long time. \n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and compromise in a long-term relationship. The author's need for sleep is valid. Chronic sleep disruption can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting that. The author tried to find a solution by suggesting separate rooms, which is a reasonable step if other compromises haven't worked. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9's counterargument is about the significance of sharing a bed. However, in some cases, especially when there are kids, separate rooms might be practical. For example, when the kids are in the room, but the author's situation is about the fianc\u00e9's noise. \n\nThe author mentioned that the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's need for the TV on might be a coping mechanism for stress or something, but it's affecting the author's health. The author's request isn't about ending the relationship but about improving their quality of life. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to consider each other's needs. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're trying to find a solution after years of struggle. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about not wanting to change his habits rather than understanding the author's needs. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a compromise that respects their own well-being. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more understanding and find solutions that work for both, like using earplugs, a white noise machine, or adjusting the TV setup.\n"
