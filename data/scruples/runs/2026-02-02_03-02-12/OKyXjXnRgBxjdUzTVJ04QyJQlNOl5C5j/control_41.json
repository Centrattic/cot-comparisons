I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and snores a lot, which is disturbing the author's sleep. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks they should just be roommates if they can't share a bed, but the author just wants good sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted due to their partner's habits. Chronic lack of good sleep can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014watching loud TV and snoring\u2014seem to be significant issues. The author has tried compromising by letting the fianc\u00e9 lower the volume by 3 points, but it's still not enough. The fianc\u00e9 responds by comparing the situation to being roommates, which might be dismissive of the author's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that they have their own needs too. Maybe they find the TV comforting, or snoring is a medical issue they can't control. However, the author's health and rest are also important. The fianc\u00e9's response that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple, seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity. That's a bit of a red flag because it suggests that the relationship is only worth it if they can share a bed, which isn't necessarily true. Relationships require compromise and finding solutions that work for both partners.\n\nThe author's request to sleep in separate rooms is a reasonable attempt to address a long-standing issue that's affecting their health. They've tried to find a middle ground before (lowering the volume), but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might indicate a lack of empathy or unwillingness to adjust, which is a problem in the relationship. The author isn't being selfish; they're seeking a solution that allows them to have basic health needs met. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being, which is essential in a healthy relationship. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more accommodating or find alternative solutions, like a white noise machine or a sleep study for snoring.\n"
