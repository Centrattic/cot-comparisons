I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The scenario involves a long-term relationship with two kids, where the author is a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV as white noise and snores a lot. The author has been dealing with this for a long time and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is their inability to sleep due to noise. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent disruption. They've been together for 8 years, so it's not a new problem. The author has tried compromising by lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's still not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response is emotional, questioning the point of being a couple if they don't share a bed.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The author tried to address the issue but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's argument about roommates vs. couples is a bit of a red herring. Sharing a bedroom isn't a requirement for a committed relationship, especially when there's a genuine need for rest. The author's health and well-being are important; chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences. Also, having two kids adds stress, so getting rest is vital.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior\u2014needing loud TV and not waking up when it's turned down\u2014shows he's resistant to change. The author's decision to propose separate rooms is a solution to a problem they've faced for years. While it's a big step, it's understandable given the circumstances. There's no indication the author is being selfish without trying other solutions. They might have tried other methods (earplugs, white noise machines) but the problem persists.\n\nIn relationships, partners should accommodate each other's needs where possible. However, this fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust, so the author is protecting their own needs. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to prioritize his comfort over the author's well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution that benefits their health, even if it means separate rooms. The answer should be B.\n"
