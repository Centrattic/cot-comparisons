I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because of their different sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper and her partner is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows, which disrupts her sleep. She's been dealing with this for a long time and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The fianc\u00e9's main issue is her need for a quiet environment to sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so her need for good sleep is valid. Her partner's habits are problematic: loud TV at half volume, snoring like a train, and being a heavy sleeper. He's tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but not enough to satisfy her needs.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the problem and the attempts to resolve it. They've been together 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. She's tried to make compromises, like the volume being lowered a bit, but it's not effective. She's exhausted and finally had enough. Her proposal to sleep separately is a solution that prioritizes her well-being, which is important in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's partner feels that sleeping separately undermines their relationship. He argues that if they can't share a bed, why be a couple instead of roommates. This is a common argument in such situations, but it's more about his feelings of intimacy and the traditional expectations of marriage. However, his habits are the root cause here, and he hasn't made sufficient changes to accommodate her needs. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make adjustments. If one's needs are causing harm to the other's health, it's reasonable to seek solutions. Sleeping in separate rooms isn't ideal, but it's a practical solution when other compromises fail. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's addressing a long-standing issue that affects her health. The partner's reaction seems more about his own discomfort than her well-being. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions are justified to protect her health and well-being, especially after enduring the situation for so long. The partner needs to be more accommodating or find a better solution than just opposing the idea of separate rooms without addressing the underlying issues.\n"
