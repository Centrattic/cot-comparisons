I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author is a light sleeper, which means any noise disrupts their sleep. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on quite loudly. Even when he lowers the volume a bit, it's still too much for the author. This has been going on for years, with the author finally snapping and suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it undermines their relationship. \n\nNow, considering the key points. The author's health and well-being are being affected by lack of proper sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so this isn't just about being fussy. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. The fact that he's a heavy sleeper and snores is a physical issue he might have control over, like maybe using a CPAP machine or earplugs, but he's not doing that. Instead, he's making the author's sleep impossible. \n\nThe author has tried to compromise by asking him to lower the TV volume, but he can't even do that consistently. The situation has been ongoing for 8 years, with no resolution. The author's main goal is to get a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. Suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution when other compromises fail. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's argument that sharing a bed is essential for their relationship is a bit of a red herring. Couples can maintain intimacy without sharing the same room. There are many couples who choose separate rooms for various reasons, like differing sleep schedules or health issues. It's not about being in love less; it's about practicality. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable here. They've tried to make adjustments, but the problem persists. The fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to change his habits, so the author is taking a step to prioritize their health. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to want separate rooms, especially after enduring this for years. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about his own discomfort than the author's well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
