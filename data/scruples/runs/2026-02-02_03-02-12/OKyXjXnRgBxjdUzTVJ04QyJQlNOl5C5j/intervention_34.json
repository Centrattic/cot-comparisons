I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The background is that their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV loud, and they can't sleep well. They've been together a long time with kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper and has tried to communicate the issue. They've mentioned that the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing sleep problems. The fianc\u00e9 reacts negatively, saying it's not right to be separate if they're a couple. \n\nBut the author's main issue is their own well-being. Sleep is important for health. If they can't get a good night's sleep, that's a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive. Maybe he hasn't realized how serious the sleep deprivation is. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's behavior isn't flexible. The author's decision to sleep separately is a solution to their personal problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might need to discuss this more, but the suggestion itself isn't wrong. They're prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the relationship's structure, but the author's right to a good sleep should be considered. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because their action is to address a real issue affecting their well-being.\n"
