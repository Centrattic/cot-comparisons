I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper, and their partner is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and a habit of watching loud TV before bed. They've been together for 8 years with two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The author's main issue is sleep deprivation due to their partner's habits. The partner isn't open to solutions like earplugs or white noise machines, and the author has tried asking them to lower the volume but without success. The author's decision to sleep separately is to get better sleep, which is a basic need. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is emotional, arguing that separate rooms would make them just roommates. However, the author's physical health and well-being are at stake here. Chronic sleep issues can lead to health problems. The author isn't dismissing the relationship but is seeking a practical solution to a real problem. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior\u2014willing to keep the TV loud and not addressing snoring\u2014shows a lack of consideration. The author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer is B. They're not in the wrong because they're prioritizing their health and have valid reasons for needing better sleep. The fianc\u00e9 isn't making accommodations, so the author's decision is justified.\n"
