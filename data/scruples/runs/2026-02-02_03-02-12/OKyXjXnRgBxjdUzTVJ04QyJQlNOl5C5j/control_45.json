I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who suggested sleeping in separate rooms is in the wrong. The background is that the person is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV loudly at night. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't compromise enough, so the person is frustrated and wants better sleep. They've been together 8 years with two kids, so this has been ongoing.\n\nFirst, evaluate the situation. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep issues for the other. Sleep is important for health, and chronic lack of sleep can affect mood, health, and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is described as not really compromising\u2014lowering the volume by 3 points from half is still too loud. The person has tried to address it but to no avail, leading to the suggestion of separate rooms.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. The fianc\u00e9 argues that not sharing a bed undermines the relationship, comparing it to being roommates. But the other person's need for rest is valid. The question is whether the suggestion is reasonable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. If one's needs are consistently unmet despite attempts to resolve, changes might be necessary. The fianc\u00e9 isn't meeting the other's needs for quiet, and the suggestion to sleep separately seems like a solution to prioritize health. It's not about wanting to be roommates, but about mutual respect for each other's well-being.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to communicate and compromise, but their needs aren't being met. The fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
