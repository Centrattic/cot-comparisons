I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper struggling with their partner's heavy snoring and TV usage at night. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV at a loud volume, and the author can't sleep properly, leading to the idea of separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and well-being, so that's a valid concern. The partner, on the other hand, is used to their sleeping habits and sees sharing a bed as important for the relationship. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, maybe they should just be roommates. But they've been together for 8 years and are engaged with two kids, so the relationship is long-term and committed.\n\nThe partner's side: they might be resistant to change. Maybe they don't realize the impact of their habits. Also, the fact that they sleep with the TV on at a high volume despite some compromise might indicate they aren't fully aware of the problem. The author has tried lowering the volume but the partner still complains, even in sleep. That suggests previous attempts didn't work.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, suggesting separate rooms is a solution to a problem that's clearly affecting their quality of life. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to address a legitimate issue. The partner might feel hurt or rejected, but the author's health and well-being are important. In relationships, both partners need to make sacrifices. However, if one partner's habits are severely affecting the other's health, it's reasonable to seek a solution, even if it's not ideal.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed is a bit extreme. Relationships can involve separate living arrangements for various reasons (like different schedules, work, etc.). It's not about the physical proximity but about mutual respect and care. The author is trying to find a way to coexist comfortably, which is a reasonable request.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to compromise before and it hasn't worked. Their health and well-being are at stake, and seeking a solution like separate rooms is a valid step. The answer should be B (No).\n"
