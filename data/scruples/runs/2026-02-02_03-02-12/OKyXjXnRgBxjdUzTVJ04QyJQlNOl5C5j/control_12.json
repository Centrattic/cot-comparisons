I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship, engaged with two kids. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, has loud snoring, and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The author is a light sleeper and can't sleep with all that noise. Despite some compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the TV volume a bit, the problem persists. The author is frustrated and finally suggests separate rooms for better sleep, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it, saying they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author's request is about their well-being and health. Sleep is important, and chronic sleep disruption can lead to health issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's quality of life. The author has tried to communicate and compromise but hasn't found a solution that works for both. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's response is emotional, suggesting that separate rooms mean their relationship is failing. But the author isn't suggesting moving out or breaking up, just sleeping in the same house but different rooms. That's a common solution for couples with incompatible sleep habits. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior might be a bit insensitive here. The author's needs are valid, and expecting to adjust one's sleep environment for health reasons isn't unreasonable. The duration of the relationship and the number of kids suggest this is a long-standing issue, so the author isn't just being fickle. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried other solutions first, like earplugs or white noise machines. But they did mention the fianc\u00e9's TV use is a problem, which can't be solved with earplugs if the TV is loud. Also, the fianc\u00e9's sleep habits (snoring) are physical and not easily changed without medical intervention. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should accommodate each other's needs. However, when one's health is at stake, the other should make adjustments. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution that respects their health while maintaining the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect of the relationship rather than the practicality of the solution. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive of the author's needs. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
