I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies on TV, and the author can't sleep well. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks it's a bad idea, arguing they might as well be roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, engaged for 1, two kids. They tried to compromise, but the fianc\u00e9 still plays loud TV, and the author can't get good sleep. The author wants to sleep separately to improve their rest, which is important for health and well-being. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: he's a heavy sleeper, so he doesn't realize the noise he's making. He says he needs the TV on, even when he lowers the volume a bit. The author's frustration is valid here. Sleep issues can lead to health problems and affect relationships. The author isn't suggesting a complete separation but just separate rooms, which is a common solution for couples with different sleep needs. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about the symbolic meaning of sharing a bed, but the author's request is practical. Long-term relationships should involve compromise, but when one's basic needs (like sleep) are being neglected, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author has tried to adjust (mentioning turning it down, but the fianc\u00e9 still complains asleep). \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should try other solutions first, like earplugs or white noise machines. But the problem here is the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to adjust further. If the author has already tried compromises and the situation isn't improving, then suggesting separate rooms isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health and well-being, which is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to overlook the author's legitimate needs. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
