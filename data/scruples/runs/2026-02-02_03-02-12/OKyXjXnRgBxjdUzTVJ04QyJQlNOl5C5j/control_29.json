I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is engaged to their partner, and they're asking if suggesting separate rooms is their fault. The main issue is about sleep. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy snorer who watches loud TV all night. They've been dealing with this for eight years, with two kids, and the author is finally snapping and saying they want to sleep in separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for sleep is important for their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various issues, so it's a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting that. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 argues that separate rooms might make them just roommates, which is a valid point about the relationship dynamic.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9's habits: he snores loudly, watches TV at a high volume, and even when he tries to lower it, it's still disruptive. The author has been dealing with this for a long time, which suggests they've tried to compromise before. The fianc\u00e9's response to turning down the volume is waking up and complaining while asleep, which seems to indicate he's not fully aware or in control of his actions at that point. That makes it hard for the author to adjust without his cooperation.\n\nThe author's action was to suggest separate rooms after years of this. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because it's a significant change to their living arrangement. But is the author wrong for prioritizing their own health? They've tried to accommodate each other, but maybe the solution of separate rooms is a reasonable step when all else has failed. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it would make them roommates is a bit dismissive of the author's legitimate needs. Relationships require compromise, but there's a point where one partner's needs are being consistently ignored, leading to potential harm.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, couples sleeping in separate rooms is more acceptable, while in others, it's seen as a sign of marital problems. But the author isn't saying they're breaking up, just separate rooms. The key is whether the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress and affecting the author's health, the author's position seems justified. The fianc\u00e9 needs to find a solution that allows both to sleep, maybe using earplugs, white noise machines, or addressing the snoring with medical help. But the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution that works for them when all else has failed. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
