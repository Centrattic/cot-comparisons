I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's a heavy sleeper and likes to watch TV loudly at night, which disturbs the other person's sleep. They've been together eight years with two kids, so this has been a long-term issue.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is a light sleeper needing a quiet environment, while the fianc\u00e9 sleeps heavily with the TV on. The fianc\u00e9's actions are causing consistent sleep problems. The author tried compromising before, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. Now the author is suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they don't share a bed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the person is acting out of a legitimate need for rest. Sleep is important for health, and chronic sleep deprivation can affect relationships. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is disruptive. The author tried to address the issue for years but finally had enough. The response from the fianc\u00e9 seems to take it personally, suggesting that sharing a bed is central to the relationship, but maybe the underlying issue isn't just about sleeping together. It's about the impact of his habits on the author's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have explored other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or even different sleep schedules. But given that they've been dealing with this for so long and the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make more significant changes, the author's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be missing the point\u2014he's taking the solution (separate rooms) as a rejection rather than acknowledging the problem (noisy environment).\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key, but both parties need to be willing to adapt. The author is seeking a solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's resistance to the solution might indicate a lack of understanding of the author's needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address their sleep issues, especially after years of trying to cope. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here, not the author's suggestion of separate rooms. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
