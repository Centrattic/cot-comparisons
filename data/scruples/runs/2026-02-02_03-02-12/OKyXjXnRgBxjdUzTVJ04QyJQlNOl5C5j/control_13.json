I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's snoring and preference for having the TV on, which disrupts the author's sleep. They've been dealing with this for a long time, 8 years together and engaged for 1, with two kids. The author is a light sleeper and really wants a good night's rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and snores a lot, and he needs the TV on. The author has tried compromising, like lowering the volume by a few points, but it's not enough. The problem is consistent every night. The author mentions they've been in this situation for a long time, which might indicate that previous attempts to resolve this haven't worked.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is that he thinks separate rooms are just like being roommates, which implies that he values sharing a bed as part of their relationship. The author's main goal is to get better sleep. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by prioritizing their sleep over the relationship's traditional aspects.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) discussions, the community often looks at both the intention and the impact. The author's intention is to improve their health and well-being by getting better sleep, which is a valid concern. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect someone's health, mood, and ability to function. The fianc\u00e9's need for the TV on and his snoring are significant issues that contribute to the problem. The author has tried to accommodate by lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the suggestion to sleep separately undermines their relationship. However, the author's engagement and having kids suggest a long-term commitment. The fianc\u00e9's compromise is minimal (lowering by 3 points, but still not enough), and his reaction seems to be about the symbolic meaning of sleeping together rather than the practical issue.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author has a legitimate need for sleep, the fianc\u00e9's habits are well-established and cause consistent problems, and the author has tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9's argument about the relationship seems less about the actual sleep issue and more about the emotional aspect. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health. The answer is B.\n"
