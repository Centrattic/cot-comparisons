I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because of the partner's heavy snoring and TV habits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a light sleeper, and their partner is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV at a high volume. The partner also says he can't hear the TV if it's turned down. The author has had enough and wants separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 thinks this is a bad idea, questioning their relationship if they can't share a bed. They've been together 8 years with two kids.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about sleep quality versus the relationship dynamics. The author is trying to address a long-term problem affecting their health and well-being. The partner is resistant, seeing it as a relationship issue.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question hinges on whether suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution given the circumstances. The author has tried to accommodate the partner by lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The sleep issues are significant, leading to \"tossing and turning\" and a \"shitty sleeps.\"\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each person's needs. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. The author's request might be seen as a necessary compromise to maintain their health. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the symbolic meaning of sharing a bed as a couple. But if the bed is a source of conflict and harm, maybe that perspective is too idealistic.\n\nThe fact that they've been together for 8 years and it's been a recurring issue suggests that the author has tried to manage it but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust, even when asked, might indicate a lack of consideration. The author's action to prioritize their health isn't inherently wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel hurt or rejected, but the author isn't proposing a breakup, just separate sleeping arrangements. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they could be roommates is a bit of a straw man, as being roommates doesn't negate their relationship status. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable solution to a legitimate problem. Since the author has tried to find a middle ground (lowering the volume a bit) but it's not working, suggesting separate rooms is a logical step. The partner's resistance might be more about not wanting to change habits rather than a valid objection. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a health issue caused by the partner's behavior. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the emotional aspect, but the author's need for rest is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
