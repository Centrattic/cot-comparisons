She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The person ordered an expensive pizza they were craving, told their girlfriend they'd get it and offered her some. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she thought he was overreacting.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and wanted a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but would have some of his pizza. He ordered, ate two pieces, then later went to the kitchen and found that she had taken toppings off all the pieces. He got upset about that, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think from both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He paid for the pizza, was really craving it, and expected that when he offered her some, she would take a piece or part of a piece. Instead, she took toppings off all the pieces, which he found selfish. He felt that she was being inconsiderate by not just taking a piece or part of one, and instead messing with all the pizzas, making it less enjoyable for him. He called her selfish and inconsiderate, and the argument escalated.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. She might have thought taking toppings from different pieces was a way to have some without taking a whole piece. She didn't take all the cheese off, so the pizza is still edible. She was confused why he was angry and thought he was overreacting. She might not have considered how her actions would affect his enjoyment of the pizza. She might have seen it as a minor thing and found his reaction disproportionate.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether the author's anger was justified. Let's analyze. The pizza was his order, he paid for it, and he was craving it. By taking toppings off all pieces, she altered the pizza in a way that he found offensive. Even if she only took some toppings, if he wanted to eat the pizza as it was, her actions would make it less satisfying for him. However, the act of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as a way to get what she wanted without taking a whole slice, but perhaps without considering his feelings.\n\nThe key here is communication. When he offered her some, maybe he should have specified that he wanted to keep the pizza intact, or she should have clarified what she meant by wanting \"some toppings.\" However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece seems to be a significant alteration. If she just took a small amount from a couple of pieces, maybe that's more reasonable, but taking from all pieces might have been more than he found acceptable.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. However, his anger might stem from feeling that she didn't respect his order and his desire to enjoy the pizza. On the other hand, the girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't see the problem, which might indicate a lack of communication or different priorities.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The author's anger might be seen as a reaction to what he perceives as selfishness, but the situation is about differing expectations. The girlfriend might not have realized that taking toppings off all the pizzas would be so offensive. However, the author could have anticipated that his partner might take some, but not in a way that ruins the pizza for him. Alternatively, he could have been more specific when he offered her something.\n\nIn relationship dynamics, it's important to consider both perspectives. The author might be in the right if he expected that when he offered her a part of his pizza, she wouldn't alter all of it. Conversely, the girlfriend might not have intended to be selfish, just to get a small amount without taking a whole piece. But the act of modifying all the pizza pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it was a special order he was craving.\n\nAnother angle is that the pizza was already ordered and paid for, so the girlfriend's actions did cost the author money and affected his meal. If she wanted toppings without taking a slice, maybe she should have ordered her own. But since she said she would have some of his pizza, maybe the expectation was that she would take a piece or part of a piece, not alter all of them. The author's frustration is over the fact that she didn't take a piece but instead took bits from all, which left him with a less enjoyable meal.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if he felt that his partner altered his meal in a way that wasn't considerate. However, the girlfriend's actions might not have been intended as selfish, and the author's reaction was perhaps a bit overzealous. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering that he called her selfish and inconsiderate and they had a big argument, maybe there's some fault on both sides. However, the main issue is the way the girlfriend took the toppings off every piece, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's anger, while perhaps intense, is a reaction to that. So, the author's action in calling her selfish and getting into an argument might be overreacting, but the core issue is the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. However, the author's response might be justified if he felt disrespected. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might depend on the perspective. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted, but his reaction (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) might be excessive. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong), as the girlfriend's actions were the main issue, and his anger is a reaction to that. Alternatively, maybe it's a shared responsibility, but the question is a binary choice. Given that, the answer is B."
