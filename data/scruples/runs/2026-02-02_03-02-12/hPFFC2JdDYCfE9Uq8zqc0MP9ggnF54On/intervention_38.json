It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza incident. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author ordered an expensive pizza they really wanted, told their girlfriend, and she said she'd just have some of it. Then, when the pizza arrived, the author took two pieces, went to watch TV, and didn't notice the girlfriend was in the kitchen. When she came back and said she took toppings off, the author later found out she had taken chunks from all the pieces. The argument ensued, with the author feeling the girlfriend was selfish and inconsiderate, while she thought the author was overreacting.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author expected that when they said the girlfriend could have some, she would take a reasonable amount, like maybe a few toppings here and there. Instead, she ended up taking chunks from every piece, which the author found disrespectful or selfish. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought it was fine because she didn't take all the cheese and the author had already taken their two pieces.\n\nI need to consider if the author's anger was justified. The pizza was expensive and a craving, so the author might have felt it was their meal. However, the girlfriend might have seen the sharing as an offer to have some without being given specific portions. The problem is in the misunderstanding\u2014did the author reasonably expect that she would take only a little, or was the girlfriend acting in a way that the author found unacceptable?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the girlfriend's actions seemed inconsiderate because she modified all the pizza pieces. The author called her selfish, which the girlfriend contested. The argument escalated. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not entirely. They had a right to be upset if they felt their meal was being altered without consent. However, the reaction might have been a bit over the top. Starting a fight over something like this could be seen as overreacting, especially if the girlfriend didn't take all the pizza or was just trying to share in her own way. But the author's frustration with the unexpected selfishness might be valid too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate. If the author had already ordered the pizza and took two pieces, expecting to have the rest, then the girlfriend taking chunks from all pieces could be seen as taking more than her share or not respecting the author's choice. However, the initial agreement was that she could have some, not necessarily that she couldn't alter the pizza. So maybe the author's anger is justified, but using the word \"selfish\" and starting a big argument might be where they went wrong.\n\nBut in the end, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The main question is whether the author's anger is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's actions were genuinely selfish or just a misunderstanding. If the girlfriend took a lot without asking, that's one thing, but if she thought it was okay, maybe the author should have communicated better. However, since the author was specific about wanting the pizza and asking if she wanted anything, the girlfriend's response was to take some toppings. The real issue is the unexpected extent of what she did. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. However, the way they handled the situation (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) might have contributed to the problem. But the core issue is the girlfriend's actions, so the author's anger is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
