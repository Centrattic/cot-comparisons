It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. They offered their girlfriend some, she said she'd take some toppings. The author assumed she meant taking toppings off a few pieces, but instead she took toppings off all the pieces. Then there's an argument.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They ordered the pizza, ate two pieces, and didn't mention the girlfriend eating until later. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, so maybe the author didn't realize she was interacting with the pizza. When the author found out, they got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's actions: She took toppings off every piece, which the author found inconsiderate. She might have thought it was okay because she didn't take the whole piece, but removing toppings from all pieces could make the remaining pizza less enjoyable for the author. The girlfriend also dismissed the author's anger, calling them a child, which could escalate the situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author could have communicated better. If the pizza was a personal order, maybe they should have specified that it was their own. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from every piece seems excessive and inconsiderate, especially if she knew the author was craving it. The author's reaction might be proportionate if they felt their needs were being disregarded. But arguments often stem from misunderstandings or different expectations. The girlfriend might have felt that since the author had already eaten two pieces, it was okay for her to adjust the remaining pizza. However, removing toppings from all pieces affects the author's experience, so the author's frustration is understandable. The key here is whether the author had a right to expect the pizza to remain as ordered. If it was a shared order, the girlfriend's action could be seen as selfish. But if it was the author's own purchase, maybe the girlfriend overstepped. However, the author didn't clarify that it was their own pizza, so maybe both have some responsibility. But the main issue is the girlfriend's action leading to the argument. The author's anger isn't unwarranted given the situation, but the initial assumption that the girlfriend would only take a little might have been naive. Still, the girlfriend's modification of all the pizza without considering the author's preference is problematic. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's action was the main issue, the answer would be B (No).\n"
