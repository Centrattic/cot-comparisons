It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. Then he orders it, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while and comes back not eating. When he asks why, she says she took toppings and cheese off every piece, not just one or two. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she meant taking toppings off one or two pieces when she said she wanted some. But she took from all pieces. He might feel that she didn't respect his order or his craving. She, on the other hand, might feel he didn't consider her preferences or that he's overreacting.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza for himself, but he mentioned she could have some. Maybe he should have clarified her preferences upfront, like how she likes her pizza. She might have different tastes, but taking from all pieces could be seen as not respecting his order. However, he did get the pizza he wanted, and she modified it without asking. \n\nBut is it fair to call her selfish and start a fight over that? The author might be reacting to feeling disrespected, but maybe his reaction was too harsh. She did say she didn't take all the cheese, just some. So maybe the argument escalated because of miscommunication. Both sides might have some responsibilities here. The author could have been more specific about how he wanted the pizza prepared, and she could have communicated her needs better instead of altering it without asking. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he ordered the pizza as per his craving and expected her to partake as he did, but she modified it without consent, he might not be in the wrong. But arguing over it might have been unnecessary. Still, the initial action (him ordering) wasn't wrong. The argument came from misunderstanding. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but both could have handled it better.\n"
