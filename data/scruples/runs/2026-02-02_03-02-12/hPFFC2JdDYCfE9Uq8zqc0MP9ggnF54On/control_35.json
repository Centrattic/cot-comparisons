It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, then when going to the kitchen found that his girlfriend had removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought she took from one or two pieces, but she took from all. The key here is whether her actions were acceptable. She took from all the pizza, which he had paid for, and he felt it was inconsiderate. He ordered it specifically, maybe expecting they'd share.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Did he have a right to be upset? The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all the slices might have been selfish, as she didn't consider that he might not like the pizza altered. On the other hand, maybe the author didn't communicate clearly. He ordered the pizza, but didn't specify whether she could take toppings. The girlfriend assumed she could take what she wanted since she didn't want a whole piece. However, removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as excessive, especially if it affected his enjoyment. \n\nThe author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. Maybe he overreacted, but the girlfriend's action was also inconsiderate. The question is whether his anger was justified. The girlfriend didn't take all the pizza, just part of it. But if removing toppings made the pizza less enjoyable for him, then he has a point. However, the argument might have been avoidable with clearer communication. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both parties could have handled it better. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. But his response of calling her selfish and starting a fight might have been disproportionate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend took actions that affected his meal, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he should have been more understanding. \n\nI think the main issue is that the girlfriend didn't consider his preferences, but the author's reaction was also harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he ordered the pizza and she took from all of it without asking, he might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
