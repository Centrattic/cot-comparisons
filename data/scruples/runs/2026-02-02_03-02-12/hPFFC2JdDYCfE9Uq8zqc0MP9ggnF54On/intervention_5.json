It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they get. Then, after the pizza arrived, the author took two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while but didn't take any pizza. When she came back, she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought she took toppings off a couple of pieces. But when he went to the kitchen, he found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The author now feels it wasn't out of proportion.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong here? The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. Let me think about this.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they paid for the pizza, wanted to enjoy it, and the girlfriend took from it without consent. The girlfriend might think she agreed to share, but maybe she didn't realize the extent of what she took. The author's anger comes from feeling disrespected or that their request was ignored. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since the author took their own pieces first, she had the right to take from the remaining pizza. She didn't take all the cheese, just some. She might not have thought it was a big deal. The author's reaction could be seen as overreacting because it's just pizza. However, the act of modifying all the pieces could be seen as selfish if done without communication.\n\nI need to consider communication here. The author assumed she took toppings off a couple, but she took from all. Maybe there was a miscommunication. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. The author's anger is about the action of taking without asking, not the pizza itself. But is getting angry over that justified? \n\nThe key points are mutual expectations. The author expected their pizza to be respected once they had their own pieces. The girlfriend might have thought she could take from the remaining without permission. The argument could have been avoided with clear communication. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's anger is a reaction to their feelings being hurt by the girlfriend's actions. The girlfriend's actions were disrespectful in a way, but the author's response (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) might be seen as a valid expression of those feelings. However, escalating to a big argument could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nBut the user's side is that the author isn't wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on perspectives. The author's reaction is justified if they felt their boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nSo, in the end, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Both sides have some responsibility, but the main wrongdoing was the girlfriend's action without consent. The author's anger is a valid response to that.\n"
