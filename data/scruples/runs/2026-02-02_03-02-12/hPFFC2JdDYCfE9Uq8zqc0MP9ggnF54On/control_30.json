It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple arguing over pizza. The author ordered a specific pizza they were craving, which was more expensive. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but mentioned she would have some of what he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to get more, he found that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author ordered the pizza because he was starving and wanted that specific place. He assumed she wanted some of it when he asked. She later took toppings off all the pieces, which left the pizza less desirable for him. He felt it was selfish, she thought it wasn't a big deal. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When the author asked if she wanted something, she said no, but later took some of the pizza. But she didn't mention she wanted to take toppings off, which is a different action than just eating a piece. The author might have expected that since he was eating his own pieces, the rest would be there for her if she wanted, but she modified it in a way that affected his ability to enjoy it. \n\nThe author's anger seems to stem from feeling that her actions were selfish. However, maybe there's a lack of communication on both sides. The author didn't clarify that he wanted to keep the pizza as is, and she didn't communicate her need to take toppings off. But she did say she would have some of what he got, which might imply she expected to eat it as it was. Taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as altering the food he paid for and wanted to eat himself. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt that she was allowed to take what she wanted from the pizza since it was ordered for both. However, taking chunks of cheese and toppings from every piece might be excessive and considerate of the author's preferences. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate, but given that the pizza was expensive and a craving, maybe not. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he ordered the pizza with the intention of eating it himself and others could have some, but then she altered it in a way that affected his enjoyment, maybe he's justified in being upset. However, he did have two pieces first, and maybe she had a right to take what she wanted from the remaining pizza. The argument might have been avoidable if there was clearer communication from the start. \n\nThe author might not be entirely at fault here. He could have considered that she might want to take toppings off a piece rather than the whole pizza. But she did take from every piece, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's response of calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion might have contributed to the argument. \n\nSo, considering both sides, it's a bit of a grey area. The author's anger is based on her actions affecting his enjoyment, but his response might have been harsh. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. The answer might hinge on whether the author overreacted. If the pizza was a special request and expensive, maybe his reaction isn't entirely wrong. But the argument could have been avoided with better communication. \n\nOverall, I think the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if the author's response was harsh. The answer would be B (No).\n"
