It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering expensive pizza, their girlfriend not eating it initially but later taking toppings off every piece, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author specifically asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever pizza he got. Then he ordered it, took two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, which he didn't think much of. When he checked, she had removed toppings from every piece. He felt she was being selfish and called her out, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the author's side is that he paid for the pizza, maybe shared it, and she altered it in a way he didn't expect. The girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't take all the cheese, just some, and thought it was okay. She also seemed confused by his anger and accused him of overreacting.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's reaction was disproportionate. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author ordered the pizza and assumed it was for both of them. When he took two pieces, maybe he expected her to take some as well. However, he didn't specify that she couldn't take toppings off if she wanted. The girlfriend might have felt she was within her rights to adjust the pizza to her liking, especially if she didn't want a whole piece.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that she was being inconsiderate by altering the pizza he had paid for, especially since it was a specific place he was craving. The fact that she removed toppings from every piece could be seen as taking more than just a few bits, which might make him feel his choice was disregarded.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he could have communicated better. Maybe he should have discussed how he wanted the pizza prepared or confirmed if she wanted it modified. By not setting clear boundaries, he might have left room for misunderstanding. His reaction of calling her selfish and starting an argument could be seen as overreacting if she didn't have ill intent. However, if he felt his preferences were respected and she went against that, he has a point.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be inconsiderate, but her reaction to his anger as being childish could also contribute to the conflict. The issue here is mutual communication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps he could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight was due to a misunderstanding and his reaction was proportionate, maybe not. But if he escalated it unnecessarily, then yes. Given the details, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong since the girlfriend altered the pizza without considering his preferences, but his approach could have been better. But the main question is if he's in the wrong for starting the fight. Since the problem was her action, maybe he's justified, but the way he reacted might be part of the issue. Hmm.\n"
