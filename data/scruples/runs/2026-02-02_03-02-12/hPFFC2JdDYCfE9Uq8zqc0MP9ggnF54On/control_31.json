It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting angry about their partner taking toppings off all the pizza pieces.\n\nFirst, the context: The author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, offered it to their girlfriend, who later took toppings off every piece. The girlfriend didn't eat anything initially and was surprised by the author's anger, calling them childish.\n\nNow, considering communication. The author assumed the girlfriend would take toppings from a couple of pieces if she wanted some, but she took from all. The girlfriend didn't clarify her request when she said she wanted toppings. Maybe the author should have checked in more, but the girlfriend's action was unexpected. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be part of the problem too. She didn't explain her actions, leading to confusion. The author's anger stems from feeling disrespected, as the pizza was a personal craving and the action seemed selfish. \n\nIs getting angry over this reasonable? It's a matter of perspective. The pizza was expensive and the author was looking forward to it. The girlfriend's action could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author could have managed expectations better. Maybe they should have communicated that they wanted to enjoy the pizza as it was. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was unexpected and maybe she thought it was fine to adjust the pizza. But taking toppings off all pieces does seem excessive if they were sharing. So, the author's reaction might be justified because of the lack of communication and the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. \n\nOverall, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The situation was a communication breakdown, but the girlfriend's action was the main issue. The author's anger is a reaction to that, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
