It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza between them and their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza they were craving. They offered the girlfriend a share, and she said she'd take some of whatever they got. The author took two pieces, went to watch TV, while the girlfriend was in the kitchen. When the author checked, the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author felt angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are communication and expectations. The author thought the girlfriend would just take toppings off a few pieces, but she took from all. The author felt it was inconsiderate, but the girlfriend didn't see the issue.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they paid for the pizza with their craving in mind, and the girlfriend altered it in a way that affected all portions. The girlfriend didn't communicate her need to adjust the toppings, leading to frustration. However, the author did not clarify their expectations when the girlfriend initially said she'd take some. Maybe they should have discussed how they wanted their pizza prepared if they were sharing. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay since the author had already taken their pieces. The author's anger might be overreacting to a minor issue, especially since it's just pizza. But the girlfriend's action of modifying all pieces could be seen as not considering the author's preferences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't clarify their expectations, leading to misunderstanding. The girlfriend didn't discuss her actions, but the author's reaction was intense. It's a bit of a grey area. However, the author might share some responsibility for not setting clear boundaries. But the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate regardless. Maybe the answer isn't black and white, but the main fault lies with the girlfriend, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
