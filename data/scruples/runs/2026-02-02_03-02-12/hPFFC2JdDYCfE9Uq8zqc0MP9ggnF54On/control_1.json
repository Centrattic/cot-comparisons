It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, she declined but said she'd have some. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back. He noticed she hadn't eaten, she said she just wanted some toppings. He assumed she took toppings off a couple of pieces, but when he checked, she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. He's now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's consider both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He explicitly asked if she wanted anything, she said no, but then took toppings from every piece. He felt she was being selfish and inconsiderate. The pizza was expensive and he was craving it. He thought she would take a couple of toppings, but instead she took from all pieces, making the pizza less enjoyable for him. His anger is based on her altering the pizza in a way he didn't expect, which made the food less satisfying for him. He might feel she overstepped by taking toppings from all pieces, not just a couple, and that her actions were inconsiderate because he had already taken his two slices. He might also feel that her response of being confused and calling him a child was dismissive and disrespectful, leading to the argument.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She initially said she didn't want anything, but later took toppings from the pizza. She might have thought it was okay since the author had already taken his share. She might not have realized that removing toppings from every piece would affect his enjoyment. She could be defensive because she didn't take all the cheese, and she might feel that the author overreacted. Her confusion and calling him a child could stem from not understanding why he was so upset over something minor. She might also feel that he wasn't considering her needs, as she wanted some toppings but didn't want a whole slice.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. The author asked if she wanted anything, she said no, but then changed her mind. That's not uncommon. However, she altered the food he had ordered, which he might see as a violation of his personal space and preference. On the flip side, she might feel he should have been more accommodating or that he was too rigid about the situation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza because he was starving and it was a place he really wanted. He had a right to expect that his food would be as he ordered. By taking toppings from all pieces, she made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. His reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be justified if he felt her actions directly impacted his enjoyment. However, the argument escalated when he called her a child and they brought up other issues. That part of the argument might be his fault for not staying focused on the issue.\n\nConversely, the girlfriend could have asked for toppings if she wanted them instead of taking them without discussing. She might have assumed it was okay since he had already taken his share, but altering the food in a way that affects the main dish could be seen as inconsiderate. However, her confusion and defensive response might indicate she didn't realize the impact of her actions.\n\nIn terms of fault, both parties could be seen as sharing responsibility. The author might have handled the situation better by discussing the issue calmly instead of escalating it into a fight. The girlfriend could have communicated her needs better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's anger was disproportionate. He explicitly ordered the pizza he wanted, expected it to be as ordered, and when she altered it in a way that made it less enjoyable, he got angry. That seems reasonable. However, the way the argument escalated (calling her selfish, inconsiderate, and a child) might be where he went overboard. The initial anger over the pizza alteration might not be unreasonable, but the manner in which he confronted her could have been the main issue leading to the fight.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author's anger wasn't entirely unwarranted given the situation, but his handling of the confrontation could be criticized. However, depending on cultural norms and relationship dynamics, some might side with the girlfriend. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the main issue was the alteration of the pizza, which affected his enjoyment, he's not entirely wrong. However, his reaction might have been the problem. But the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, not just the argument's escalation. The initial act of getting angry over her taking the toppings could be seen as not entirely his fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
