It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and when he went to the kitchen, his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author ordered pizza, told his girlfriend, and she said she'd have some. He ate two slices, then later found that she had messed with all the remaining pizza. He's upset because he expected her to take maybe some toppings off a couple of slices, not all the pieces. She didn't think it was a big deal and thought he was overreacting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points: The author ordered pizza, which is a shared expense since they're a couple. He ate two slices, but the rest were altered. The girlfriend took toppings and cheese off every piece, leaving them inedible for him. The author felt this was selfish and inconsiderate. She thought it was okay because he had his own slices. \n\nNow, considering the social norms here. In a relationship, sharing meals is common. The author assumed that the pizza was for both of them, so altering it completely would prevent him from enjoying it as intended. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't take any slices but modified the remaining pizza, which the author saw as taking without asking. \n\nIs getting angry over this disproportionate? Well, if the pizza was ordered as a shared meal, then the girlfriend using the remaining pizza in a way that makes it inedible for the author is problematic. The author's right to expect that the pizza would be available for him to eat as ordered could be valid. However, maybe the girlfriend had a different expectation, thinking that since he had his own slices, she could use the leftovers as she pleased. \n\nBut the main issue is that she modified all the remaining slices, making it impossible for the author to eat them if he wanted. That's a significant action. The author's frustration is about the selfishness of altering shared food without considering others' preferences. The girlfriend's response of being confused and calling him childish suggests a lack of consideration for his feelings. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might be in the right for feeling disrespected. However, the way he called her selfish and inconsiderate could be seen as an overreaction, depending on the context. But if she genuinely didn't consider his feelings and altered the food, then his reaction is understandable. The question is whether his anger is justified. Since it's a shared expense and meal, she shouldn't have done that without discussing. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
