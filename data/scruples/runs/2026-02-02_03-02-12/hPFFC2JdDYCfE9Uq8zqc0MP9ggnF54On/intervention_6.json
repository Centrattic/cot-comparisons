It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement over pizza between the author and their girlfriend. The author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of what he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went back, and found that she had taken toppings off every piece in the kitchen.\n\nThe author got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and they ended up in an argument. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. \n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author ordered the pizza intending to share, but the girlfriend ended up taking toppings from all the pieces. The author felt it was selfish because he assumed she wanted to share, but she took what she wanted without considering his portion. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning was that she only took some toppings, not all, and she didn't take the author's pieces. She even said she didn't take all the cheese off. She might have thought that since he had his own pieces, she could take from the remaining ones without issue.\n\nBut the author was upset because she took from all the pieces, not just one or two. That could mean he felt his pizza was compromised, and maybe he felt disrespected that she took more than just the toppings he thought she would. The author also called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the argument. \n\nNow, considering typical relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author might have expected her to take only a small amount or not take from the pizza at all. However, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken his pieces, she could take from the rest as needed. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author ordered pizza from a place he considers worth it, even though it's more expensive. If the girlfriend took toppings from all the remaining pieces, that might have made the pizza less enjoyable for the author, especially if he was craving it. The author's anger could be justified if he felt she wasn't respecting his choice or his money. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt that she was within her rights to take what she wanted from the pizza they ordered together. She didn't take the entire pizza or all the toppings, just some. Maybe she didn't realize that taking toppings off every piece would affect his enjoyment. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's labeling her as selfish and inconsiderate might have been a harsh response. However, the author did feel that his investment in the pizza was being undermined. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some fault. The author could have clarified his expectations before ordering. Maybe he should have specified that he wanted to keep some pieces untouched. On the other hand, the girlfriend could have asked before taking toppings off, especially if she noticed he was being particular. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author got angry and called her names, which led to an argument. However, his anger was a reaction to an action he found selfish. If the girlfriend's action was indeed selfish, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The problem is that they didn't communicate their expectations beforehand. \n\nIn many relationships, partners might have different ways of handling shared food. If the author had mentioned that he wanted to savor the pizza as it was, the girlfriend might have been more careful. But given the situation as described, the author's frustration seems valid because the girlfriend altered the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment. \n\nHowever, the author's response of calling her selfish and escalating the argument might be where he went wrong. While his feelings are justified, the way he expressed them could have been more constructive. But the initial act of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The girlfriend's action contributed to the problem, but the author's reaction also played a role in escalating the conflict. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the core issue is the girlfriend's action, the author's anger is a reaction to that. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
