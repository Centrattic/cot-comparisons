It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said no but would have some of what he gets. He orders it, eats two slices, then goes to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, he notices she's not eating. She says she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The author gets angry, calls her selfish, and the argument escalates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author felt that the girlfriend was being inconsiderate by taking the toppings off all the pizza pieces, which he wanted. He might think that since he ordered it, it's his, and she shouldn't mess with it. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since she was going to have some of the pizza, she could customize it as she liked. She probably didn't expect the author to be upset because she thought he had already taken his share. \n\nCommunication seems like a key issue here. The author assumed that the girlfriend would only take toppings from a couple of pieces, but she did it to all. Maybe the author should have clarified how he wanted the pizza prepared. Also, when he ordered it, maybe he should have specified if he wanted the whole pizza to stay intact. On the flip side, the girlfriend might have known that the pizza was ordered specifically for him, so taking toppings off all of it without discussing could be seen as selfish. However, she might not have considered how important the pizza was to him, so maybe she didn't realize the impact of her actions.\n\nThe argument started when the author got angry, but the girlfriend was confused why he was so upset. The author called her names and accused her of being selfish, which could have been the trigger for the argument. In a relationship, how you handle disagreements matters. Maybe the author could have expressed his feelings without attacking her, leading to a better resolution. However, the girlfriend's actions did show a lack of consideration for his preferences. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the expectations. If the author didn't communicate his need for the pizza to stay whole, he might share some responsibility. But if the girlfriend took it upon herself to alter all the pizza without checking back, she's also at fault. The author's reaction was intense, leading to the argument. Maybe both could have handled it better. But since the question is about the author's fault, the answer might lean towards A if his reaction was unreasonable. However, if his anger was justified due to her inconsiderate action, then B. I'm a bit torn, but since the author called her selfish and raised their voices, maybe A. But maybe B because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. Hmm.\n"
