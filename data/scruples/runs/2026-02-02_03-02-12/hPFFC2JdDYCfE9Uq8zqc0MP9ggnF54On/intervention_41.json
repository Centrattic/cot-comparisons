It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he ordered the pizza because he was starving, and when he found out she had modified all the pieces in a way that made them less enjoyable for him, he felt justified in getting upset. The girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings, and she felt he was overreacting.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, communication seems to be an issue here. When he asked if she wanted anything, she said she would just have some of whatever he got. He might have assumed she meant she'd take a piece, but she interpreted it as just taking toppings off. Maybe they didn't clarify what \"some of the toppings\" meant. The author ordered the pizza for himself with the understanding that she would take whatever she wanted, but she ended up altering the pizza in a way that affected his experience. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that his choice and effort to get the pizza were disregarded. However, the argument escalated because he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be seen as harsh. But given that she modified all the pieces, which is more than just a little, he had a right to be upset. On the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated better before ordering, like confirming how she wanted to share the pizza. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, as taking toppings off every piece does reduce the quality for the person who ordered it. But she didn't take all the cheese, so there's some middle ground. The author's reaction might have been a bit over the top, but given the situation, it's understandable. It's a matter of whether the response was proportional. Since the author felt wronged and the girlfriend didn't take into account his preferences, the author isn't entirely wrong. He's justified in being upset, but maybe the way he expressed it could have been handled better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the initial action (ordering pizza with the expectation of sharing) and the subsequent discovery of her modifying all pieces led to a justified frustration, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
