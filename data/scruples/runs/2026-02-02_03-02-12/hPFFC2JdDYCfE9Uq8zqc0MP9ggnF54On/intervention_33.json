It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered pizza for themselves and their girlfriend. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got, but when he got home, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author felt that his girlfriend was being inconsiderate by taking the toppings off all the pizza, which he valued because it's a specific, more expensive place. He ordered it for both of them, and she ended up altering all the pizza, which he found selfish. On the other hand, his girlfriend might have thought that since he had already taken his pieces, she was just doing what she wanted with the remaining pizza. She didn't take all the cheese, just some, and maybe she didn't realize how much the author valued that pizza.\n\nI should think about communication here. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said she would have some of what he got. So the author might have expected her to take a piece as is. But maybe she thought she could modify it to her liking. The problem arises when he ordered the pizza and didn't specify how she wanted it. Maybe there was a miscommunication. The author might have assumed that since she said she wanted some of what he got, she wanted the same toppings. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as not respecting the author's preference, especially if the pizza was ordered with specific toppings that the author wanted. \n\nAnother angle is that the author reacted with anger and called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. The girlfriend responding by saying he was acting like a child suggests that maybe his response was overly harsh, even if her action was inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author's reaction was proportional to the act. Taking toppings off one or two pieces might be more understandable, but doing it to every piece could be seen as going too far. \n\nHowever, the author didn't mention discussing the toppings beforehand. If the girlfriend had a specific dietary need or preference, maybe he should have adjusted the order. But since he ordered the pizza for both without checking her preferences, perhaps he's partially at fault for not considering her needs, even though her action was inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response in calling her selfish and starting a fight could be seen as the wrong move. The argument escalated because of his reaction. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because he could have communicated better and handled the situation without escalating it. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's action was indeed selfish and disrespectful, then maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nI need to balance both sides. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was also harsh. Since the question is about who is in the wrong, maybe the author is at fault for overreacting. So the answer would be A. But I'm a bit conflicted because the girlfriend's action is also inconsiderate. However, in terms of who started the fight, it's the author's reaction that led to the argument. So the answer is A.\n"
