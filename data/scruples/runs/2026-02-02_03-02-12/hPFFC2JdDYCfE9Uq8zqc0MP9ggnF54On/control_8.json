It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation. Let me try to break this down.\n\nSo the story goes that the person ordered an expensive pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, she said no but later took toppings off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and wanted it from a specific place. They might have expected their girlfriend to respect that, especially since it was a treat they were looking forward to. However, when the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, that could make the pizza less enjoyable for the author, who was already anticipating eating it.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything but later changed her mind. She might have thought it was okay to take some toppings since she didn't want a whole piece. But the fact that she took from every piece seems like overdoing it. The author probably felt that was inconsiderate, leading to the argument.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched, perhaps assuming the girlfriend would take maybe one or two pieces. The girlfriend might not have realized how much it mattered to the author. But when she altered all the pizza, it crossed a line for the author, making them feel disrespected.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Maybe not. Getting angry over something that's a personal preference can be seen as overreacting. But if the author had communicated their wishes clearly, the situation might have been avoided. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza without considering the author's feelings does seem inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author's reaction might be disproportionate, but given the context of the expense and the effort to get that specific pizza, their frustration is understandable. The girlfriend's behavior was perhaps selfish, and the author had the right to express that. The problem might lie in how the argument escalated, but the initial anger isn't entirely unfounded. \n\nIn terms of who's more at fault, maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), that's because the girlfriend's actions were the main issue. But if the author didn't set clear expectations, then maybe they share some blame. However, given the girlfriend's response and the fact that she took from every piece, the author's anger is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
