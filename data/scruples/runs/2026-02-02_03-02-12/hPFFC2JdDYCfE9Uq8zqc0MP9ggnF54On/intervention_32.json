It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza fight between the author and their girlfriend. The author ordered expensive pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted anything, which she declined, saying she'd have some of whatever they got.\n\nThen the author ordered the pizza, ate two pieces, and went back to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she didn't eat anything. The author found out later that she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece, not just one or two. The author got angry, called her selfish, and there was a big argument. The author feels that getting angry over this isn't out of proportion.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought that by offering the pizza and asking if she wanted anything, they had made it clear that the pizza was for both of them. However, the girlfriend took what she wanted but in a way that ruined the pizza for the author. The author felt that taking the toppings off every piece was selfish and inconsiderate because they wanted to eat the pizza as it was. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was just taking what she wanted without considering how it affected the author.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had a specific craving and paid for the pizza, expecting to share it with their partner. The girlfriend's actions left the author with a less enjoyable meal. The author's reaction might seem over the top to some, but from their point of view, it's about respect and consideration in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already eaten two pieces and she was taking the toppings off the remaining pieces, it wasn't a big deal. She might not have realized that the author wanted to eat the pizza as it was. Maybe there was a miscommunication. The author didn't explicitly say, \"Don't take the toppings off,\" so maybe the girlfriend didn't think it was an issue.\n\nBut wait, the author did order the pizza expecting to share it. If the girlfriend wanted to modify the pizza, she should have communicated that. Instead, she took it upon herself to alter the food the author had paid for and craved. That does seem inconsiderate. The author has the right to feel upset, especially if they were looking forward to eating the pizza as it was. The girlfriend's actions might not have been malicious, but they were inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction was to call the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The girlfriend felt the author was overreacting. The question is whether the author was wrong for getting angry. It depends on the context of their relationship and past interactions. If this is a recurring issue, maybe the author's reaction is justified. But if it's an isolated incident, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nBut given the information, the author's anger seems reasonable because their partner altered the food they had paid for and craved, without considering their feelings. The girlfriend's actions were selfish in that she didn't think about how her changes affected the author. The author isn't wrong in feeling upset. They have a right to expect that when they share food, it's respected in a way that allows both parties to enjoy it. So, the answer is B.\n"
