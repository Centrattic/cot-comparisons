It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza, told their girlfriend they were going to get it, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then when the pizza arrived, the author took two pieces, went to watch TV, and the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When the author checked, the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The key points are communication and expectations. The author asked if the girlfriend wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever pizza he got. So the author assumed she would take a piece or part of a piece. However, the girlfriend ended up modifying all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. \n\nThe girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as taking from the shared pizza without considering the author's preference. Even if she didn't take all the cheese, altering the pizza might have affected the author's enjoyment. The author's anger might be justified if they expected the pizza to remain as ordered, especially since they paid for it. However, the author did ask if she wanted something, and she said she'd take some, which might imply that she expected to have some input on how to modify the pieces.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust the pizza to her liking, especially if she didn't take entire pieces. The author's reaction could be over the top, as the girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza, just parts. But the act of modifying all pieces could still be seen as selfish if it's affecting the author's meal. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication breakdown. The author didn't check if the girlfriend had taken some before eating their own pieces. Maybe if he had waited or checked the pizza before finishing his own, there wouldn't have been an issue. The girlfriend didn't clarify her intentions when she said she'd take some. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing food can be a sensitive topic. If someone pays for the pizza, they might expect it to be respected in its original form. However, if it's a shared meal, modifying the food could be acceptable if both parties are aware and agree. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust it to her taste, but the author felt it was disrespectful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's anger might be a reaction to feeling disrespected or taken advantage of. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have been inconsiderate. However, the author could have handled it better by communicating first. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry. If the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, then the author isn't wrong. But if the author overreacted, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether modifying the pizza is considered selfish. Since the girlfriend took from all pieces, it's possible the author's reaction is justified. However, calling someone selfish and blowing things out of proportion could be seen as the author's fault. The answer might be a mix of both, but in terms of the question (A or B), the answer would depend on whose fault the situation is. If the girlfriend's actions were the main issue, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the author overreacted, then he is. Given the details, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were more inconsiderate, leading to a justified reaction, even if the argument escalated.\n"
