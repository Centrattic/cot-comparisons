It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The story goes that the author ordered an expensive pizza, ate two slices, and then found out that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. He's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author ordered the pizza because he was craving it and asked if she wanted anything. She said she would have some of whatever he got, which he took as her wanting to eat some of the pizza. He ordered, ate his part, and then found out she didn't just take a few toppings but stripped all of them off every piece. That's the main point of contention here.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. If she wanted to eat without the toppings, maybe she could have just taken one or two slices and removed the toppings from those. But instead, she went through all the pieces, which the author found excessive and selfish. The author's reaction was anger, calling her selfish, and the argument escalated. The girlfriend, on the other hand, felt the author was overreacting and being a child.\n\nNow, considering the situation, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza for himself, but he also thought she wanted to eat some. The fact that she didn't take a piece but instead stripped all the toppings off the remaining slices might be seen as taking without considering the others' preferences. The author's anger stems from feeling disrespected or that his effort to share the meal was undermined. However, the argument might have been over a minor issue. But the key is whether the author's reaction was justified.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often overreact, but the context matters. The girlfriend's action was not just taking a few toppings but completely ruining the remaining pizza for the author. The author's anger is about the selfish act of making the pizza inedible to him. The girlfriend's confusion and dismissal of his feelings might indicate a lack of consideration, which could justify the author's frustration. However, the argument itself might have been unnecessary. But the core issue is the girlfriend's action, not the author's initial order. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the way he handled it (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) could be seen as his part of the problem. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. Since the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, his anger isn't entirely his fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
