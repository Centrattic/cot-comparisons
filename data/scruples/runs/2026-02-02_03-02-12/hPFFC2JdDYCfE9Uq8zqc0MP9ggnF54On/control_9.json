My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza with the girlfriend. The user ordered pizza from a specific place because he was craving it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she didn't eat. He asked why, and she said she took some toppings off the pizza. He thought she meant maybe one or two pieces, but when he went to the kitchen, she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off every single piece.\n\nHe got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate. She thought he was overreacting, said he was acting like a child. They had a big argument. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for starting the fight over this.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, he ordered pizza he wanted, which was a bit expensive but he thought it was worth it. He offered her to get something, she declined, but said she'd have some of whatever he got. So maybe he thought she was okay with him getting the pizza he wanted, and she would just have a piece or two. Then he eats two pieces, and comes back. She's in the kitchen, and when he checks, she's taken toppings off every piece. He's upset because he thought she would just take some toppings off one or two pieces, but instead she did all of them. \n\nThe problem here is communication. He assumed she meant taking toppings off a few pieces, but she actually took from all. But did he communicate that properly? When he asked her if she wanted anything, she said no, but then ended up taking toppings from the pizza. So maybe she didn't clarify that she wanted to modify the pizza in a way that would affect all pieces. However, he didn't check in again after she came back to the living room and didn't eat. Maybe he could have asked again if she wanted something before eating. \n\nOn the other hand, she took toppings off every piece, which might make the pizza less enjoyable for him, especially if he was craving it. If she wanted to modify the pizza, maybe she should have asked if that was okay. But he didn't specify that he wanted the toppings to stay. So maybe both sides have some responsibility here. \n\nHe called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a harsh reaction, but if he values the pizza and she altered it without considering his preferences, maybe he has a point. However, the argument escalated, and he might have overreacted by calling her names. She also didn't seem to understand why he was upset, which could indicate a miscommunication. \n\nSo is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He had his own preferences, she had hers. But he could have checked in again to see if she wanted to modify the pizza. However, her taking all the toppings without asking could also be seen as inconsiderate. The key is whether his anger was justified. He might not be in the wrong, but perhaps both sides missed communication opportunities. The question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. If he was the one who initiated the argument by being angry, then maybe he's partially at fault. But if her actions were indeed selfish and he had a right to be upset, then maybe not. \n\nSo, given that she didn't communicate her intent to take toppings from all pieces and he didn't check in, but he did get angry and called her names, maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because her actions were inconsiderate, but he could have handled it better. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he started the fight by being angry and called her names, but the root cause was her actions, it's a bit tricky. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, usually the person is considered the asshole if their reaction is disproportionate. Here, the user's reaction was anger and calling her names, but the action was in response to her modifying the pizza without considering him. If she had a right to the pizza since it was his, maybe not. But since he ordered it, it's his property, so she modifying it without his consent could be an issue. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because his girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but he should have handled it with more communication and less anger. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the fight started because of his reaction, but the root cause was her actions, it's a bit of a toss-up. But in AITA contexts, the person who initiates the conflict is often considered the asshole if their reaction is too strong. However, in this case, the author's anger was a response to her inconsiderate act. So maybe he's not the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, author is not in the wrong) because the root issue was her taking toppings without considering him, but he could have handled it better. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight was his fault for getting angry, then maybe A. But if her actions were the main issue, then B. Given that she took all the toppings and he was entitled to the pizza as he ordered it, maybe he's not in the wrong. So B.\n"
