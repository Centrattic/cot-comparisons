It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza they were craving. They told their girlfriend they were going to order it and asked if she wanted anything. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to the kitchen, found that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nSo, the key points here: The girlfriend agreed to have some of whatever he ordered. He assumed she took a few pieces and maybe took toppings off. But instead, she took toppings off all the pieces. He felt this was selfish and inconsiderate because he was craving that pizza. She thought it was fine since he already had his two pieces and didn't take all the cheese off. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they were excited about the pizza, ordered it as a treat for themselves, and expected their girlfriend to have a reasonable amount of consideration. When they found out all the toppings and cheese were removed from all the slices, it's understandable to be upset because their expectation was that she would take maybe one or two pieces, not alter all the pizza. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he had already eaten his share, she had the right to adjust the remaining pizza as she saw fit. She might not have considered that he wanted to enjoy the pizza as it was. However, the fact that she took toppings off every single piece, not just one or two, could be seen as overstepping. It's possible she didn't communicate her intention to modify the pizza before he ate his pieces, which could have been a point of clarity. \n\nThe argument escalated when the author called her selfish and childish. While the action of removing toppings might seem minor to some, in the context of someone's craving and the specific type of pizza, it's a valid point of frustration. The key here is whether the action was unreasonable. Taking the whole topping off every piece without discussion could be seen as disrespectful to the author's preference. However, the author's reaction might have been over the top, especially if the argument led to bringing up other issues. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't check if the pizza was okay before eating their pieces, and maybe should have communicated more clearly about their own preferences regarding the pizza. However, the girlfriend's action of altering all the pizza without discussion could also be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They got angry and called the girlfriend names, which might have been the immediate cause of the fight. But the root issue is mutual misunderstanding. The author's anger could be justified given the situation, but their reaction might have been harsh. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering both sides, it's a nuanced situation. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction could have been handled better. But given the options (A or B), and the user's own thought that the author isn't in the wrong, the answer might be B.\n"
