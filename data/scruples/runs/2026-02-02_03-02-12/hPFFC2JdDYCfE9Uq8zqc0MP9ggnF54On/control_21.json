It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a specific, expensive pizza they were craving, offering the girlfriend some, and then finding out she removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author ordered the pizza for themselves, but offered it to their girlfriend. She said she wanted some toppings but not a whole piece. The author assumed she took toppings off one or two pieces, but instead she did every piece. The author was upset because they felt their girlfriend was being selfish, while she thought it was fine since she didn't take all the cheese. The argument escalated, and the author called her inconsiderate, leading to a bigger fight.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author act unreasonably? The pizza was ordered for the author's craving, and they might have expected it to be their own, but since they offered it, the girlfriend may have felt it was available for her to use. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from all pieces might be seen as taking without consideration for the owner's preference. The author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which the girlfriend dismissed. \n\nBut is the author at fault? Maybe they didn't communicate clearly. If the author wanted to keep the pizza as their own, they should have specified that. Conversely, the girlfriend might have misunderstood the offer. However, the girlfriend's action of altering all the pieces could be seen as overstepping, even if she thought it was okay to take some. The author's frustration is understandable because their personal craving was compromised. \n\nOn the other hand, the argument over pizza might be an overreaction. The author called their partner selfish and a child, which is harsh. Maybe the author should have discussed it calmly instead of getting angry. The girlfriend might have been trying to be polite by taking some toppings, not realizing it upset the author.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was in the wrong. The author ordered the pizza for themselves but offered it, so there's a shared expectation. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response was confrontational. Both might have contributed to the conflict. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If the author was upset because their personal choice was altered, that's valid. But the way they reacted could be seen as the problem. However, the girlfriend's actions were the trigger. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had a right to be upset, but their reaction might be excessive. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong\" generally. Given that the girlfriend did take from all pieces without considering the author's preferences, the author's anger isn't entirely out of line. But maybe the author should have communicated better. Hmm. The answer is tricky. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but their reaction might have been too harsh. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author acted on a reasonable frustration and the girlfriend's actions were the main issue, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author's reaction was disproportionate, then A. But the story says the author felt justified in being angry over selfishness. So the answer might be B.\n"
