It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves a girlfriend who took toppings off every pizza slice, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out the girlfriend had removed toppings from all the remaining slices. The author got angry, called her selfish, and the argument escalated. The question is whether the author was wrong for getting upset.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that the girlfriend didn't respect the order or was being inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author had already eaten, she could do what she wanted with the leftovers. \n\nBut is getting angry over this justified? The author mentions it's a specific, expensive pizza they both wanted. The girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza but then took toppings off all slices, which might have been unexpected. The author's frustration could stem from feeling disrespected or that their craving wasn't considered. However, the argument might have been overreacted to, especially since it's just pizza. \n\nThe key points are communication and expectations. The girlfriend didn't clarify her intent when she said she wanted some toppings, leading to a misunderstanding. The author's reaction was harsh, using words like \"selfish\" and \"child,\" which escalated the situation. While the author's feelings are valid, the way they expressed them might be where they're at fault. \n\nBut the initial act of the girlfriend taking toppings off all slices without discussing it could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have been within their rights to be upset, but the response was disproportionate. The answer might hinge on whether the anger was justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn relationships, minor issues can lead to big arguments if communication is lacking. The author's anger might be a result of pent-up frustrations, not just the pizza. However, the specific incident\u2014taking toppings off all slices\u2014could be seen as selfish, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the way the argument unfolded might have been their fault. \n\nOverall, it's a bit of both. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish, and the author's anger was a reaction to that, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the argument's escalation and the choice of words might place some blame on the author. But the initial issue of the girlfriend's actions could justify the anger. So perhaps the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
