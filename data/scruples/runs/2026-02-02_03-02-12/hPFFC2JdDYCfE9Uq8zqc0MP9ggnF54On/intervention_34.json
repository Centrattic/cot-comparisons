It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend, who said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two slices, but when he went to the kitchen later, his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that since he ordered the pizza for himself and she wanted some, it's understandable that he's upset when she took parts of all the slices. But she might think that since he had already taken his two slices, the rest was fair game. She might not have realized the value he placed on that specific pizza, given it's more expensive and he was craving it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the pizza intact or that he was eating it all. The girlfriend might have assumed that since he had his slices, the remaining pizza was up for grabs. However, the fact that the author ordered such pizza (more expensive) could imply he had a higher value on it, so maybe he should have set clearer boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend taking toppings from every piece might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the author wanted to enjoy the pizza as it was. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, arguments over food can be trivial, but if the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful towards his preferences, maybe it's justified. However, the author didn't communicate his expectations. He might have assumed she would only take from the remaining slices, but she took from all, which could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend's confusion might stem from not understanding the significance of the pizza to him. \n\nBut then again, the author's reaction led to a big argument. Maybe he overreacted, especially if the pizza wasn't his entire day's meals. The question is whether his anger was proportionate. If the girlfriend had taken a few pieces or even some toppings from extra slices, it might be different. Taking from every piece could be seen as wasteful or inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have shared better or clarified that he wanted to keep the pizza as ordered. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of his craving or the value he placed on the pizza. So, maybe both sides have some responsibility here. \n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's actions versus the author's reaction. The author's anger over her taking toppings and cheese from all pieces might be justified if he wanted to enjoy the pizza as it was. However, the argument might have been avoided with better communication. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong since the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but perhaps he could have handled it without a big argument. However, given the situation, his reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
