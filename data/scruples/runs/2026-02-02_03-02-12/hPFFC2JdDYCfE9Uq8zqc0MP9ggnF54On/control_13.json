It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were going to order it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, but said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then the author ate two pieces, went back to the living room, and when they checked, the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The author assumed that when the girlfriend said she'd have some of the pizza, it meant she'd take a piece or two, maybe even take toppings off a couple of pieces if she wanted specific toppings. But instead, she took toppings off all the pieces, which the author found selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend was confused about the anger and even accused the author of overreacting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the author ordered the pizza because they wanted it. The girlfriend agreed to have some of what the author got, which they might have interpreted as sharing the same pizza. The author might have expected that she'd take a piece or two, not deconstruct all the pizza. The girlfriend's action of removing toppings and cheese from every piece seems excessive and possibly disrespectful to the author's craving for that specific pizza. \n\nHowever, the author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza prepared a certain way. They might have assumed that the girlfriend would take a reasonable amount. But the girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she could take what she wanted without considering that the author might be upset. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the pizza was expensive and the author was really craving it. The girlfriend's actions made the pizza less enjoyable for the author. The author felt that the girlfriend was being selfish. But maybe they should have communicated their expectations more clearly. If the author wanted the pizza to stay intact, they might have said something like, \"I ordered this specific pizza because I want it as it is. If you want some toppings, maybe take a couple of pieces?\" But they didn't, so maybe the author is partly at fault for not setting clearer boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of deconstructing all the pizza without considering the author's preferences could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if she thought it was okay, removing all the toppings and cheese would significantly alter the pizza's quality, which the author might have found frustrating. The argument escalated because of a lack of communication on both sides. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? They might be partially at fault for not being clear about their expectations. However, the girlfriend's actions were also selfish. The main issue is whether the author's anger was justified given the lack of prior communication. But since the author was the one who ordered the pizza and didn't specify the terms, maybe they should have considered that. Alternatively, the girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate regardless. \n\nI think the answer might be that the author is not entirely wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author could have communicated better. However, in the context of the question, which is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (No) because the girlfriend's actions were more inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while perhaps intense, was a response to selfishness.\n"
