It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, told their girlfriend they were going to get it, and she agreed she didn't want anything. Then, after the author took two pieces, the girlfriend took toppings and cheese off all the pieces in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author ordered pizza because they were craving it, and the girlfriend said she didn't want anything. The author assumed that if she wanted some, she'd take the toppings off a couple of pieces. But instead, she took toppings off all of them, which the author found inconsiderate. The girlfriend was confused and thought it was fine. The argument escalated.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me think about the dynamics here.\n\nThe girlfriend agreed not to order anything else, so she probably expected to share what the author ordered. However, when she took toppings off all the pizza, she might have done so without considering that the author wanted to eat the pizza as is. The author's frustration comes from feeling that their meal was compromised. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay since she wasn't taking whole pieces. But taking toppings off all pieces could significantly alter the author's intended meal, especially if they paid extra for those toppings.\n\nThe key issue is about shared expectations and communication. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her actions. However, taking toppings off all pieces might be seen as excessive, especially when the author had already taken their share. The author's anger might be justified if they felt their meal was being ruined. However, blowing up over it could be seen as overreacting, but given the context, maybe not entirely unreasonable.\n\nIn relationships, these minor issues can lead to bigger arguments if communication isn't clear. The author's reaction could be considered a bit harsh, but the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. The line between being inconsiderate and having a justified reaction is thin here. Since the author had explicitly mentioned craving the pizza and it being worth the price, the girlfriend's actions might have been disrespectful to that desire. Therefore, the author's anger isn't entirely out of proportion. So I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
