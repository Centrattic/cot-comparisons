It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author ordered a specific pizza they were craving. They told their girlfriend they were going to order and asked if she wanted anything. She declined but said she'd have some of whatever he ordered. Then he took two pieces, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, came back, and the author noticed she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that when she said she would have some of the toppings, she meant taking off a small amount from maybe one or two pieces. However, she ended up removing toppings and cheese from every piece, which the author found inconsiderate.\n\nBut was the author wrong to get angry? Well, the girlfriend didn't ask for permission or inform him about her actions. She did what she wanted with the shared food without considering his feelings. The author might feel that since he paid for the pizza, he had an expectation of how it would be consumed. However, the girlfriend was part of the initial agreement to share the pizza. Removing all toppings could make the pizza less enjoyable for the author, who was specifically craving it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't check if she wanted to modify the pizza before eating it. He just assumed. Also, the argument escalated quickly, and the author used harsh language (\"selfish,\" \"child\"). But the girlfriend could have communicated better. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both might have miscommunicated. The author's anger might be justified because he felt disrespected, but his reaction could be seen as over the top for just pizza. However, if the girlfriend modified the food without discussion, that's inconsiderate too. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. But the way he reacted might have been harsh. Still, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the main issue was her modifying the pizza without talking, the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. So the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
