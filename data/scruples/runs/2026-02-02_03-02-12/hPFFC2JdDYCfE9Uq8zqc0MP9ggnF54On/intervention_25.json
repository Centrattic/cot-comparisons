It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The story is that the author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they'd been craving. They offered their girlfriend some, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, then later found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about expectations. The author thought the pizza was for both of them to share, but his girlfriend ended up taking parts off all the pieces, which made them less enjoyable for him. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the girlfriend intended. She said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author assumed she took from one or two pieces, but she took from all. Maybe she didn't realize the impact on him. Did she overstep by modifying the pizza so much? Or was he being too controlling by not splitting the pizza into portions first?\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might not be malicious. Maybe she didn't think about how it would affect him, especially since he had been craving it. However, the author's reaction is intense. Calling her selfish and bringing up past arguments could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. But if he had communicated his expectations earlier, like setting aside his two pieces or preparing for her to take some toppings, maybe this wouldn't have happened.\n\nIs getting angry over someone taking parts of the pizza he ordered, even if he was willing to share, reasonable? It's a matter of personal boundaries. If he paid for it and wanted to enjoy it as is, her altering all the pieces without his consent could be seen as inconsiderate. But was he wrong to be upset? Or is the fight about miscommunication and differing expectations rather than one side being clearly wrong?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response\u2014being confused and defensive\u2014might indicate she didn't consider his feelings. But the author could have handled it more calmly. Maybe they both have some responsibility here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action was starting the fight, maybe he overreacted. But if her actions were indeed selfish, then his reaction is justified.\n\nI think the key is that the author might have a valid point about the selfishness, but his response was harsh. However, since the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, maybe he's not entirely wrong. The answer might depend on whether the main issue is about the pizza being altered or the escalation of the argument.\n"
