It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza for themselves, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no but later took toppings off all the pieces. The fight happened because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend initially said she'd have some of whatever pizza he got. He ordered it, took two pieces, and went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back and didn't eat. He asked why, and she said she took toppings off. When he went to the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she meant taking toppings off one or two pieces, but she did it to all. The girlfriend didn't clarify her actions, leading to misunderstanding. He got upset because he felt she was being selfish and inconsiderate. She thought he was overreacting.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he ordered the pizza, and she agreed to have some of it. If she didn't want the pizza as ordered, she should have communicated that. However, he didn't check on her request before ordering. Maybe he could have asked if she had a specific type in mind, since it's an expensive place. But he did offer her to have some of what he ordered. She said no, so he proceeded. \n\nHer taking toppings off all the pieces without discussing might be inconsiderate. However, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating to a fight might be over the top. The question is whether his anger was justified. Since she modified the pizza without discussing it, he felt his request was disrespected. But maybe he could have handled it with more understanding instead of immediate anger.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to see if that's valid. The author's frustration is about her altering the pizza without consent. The girlfriend's confusion adds to the misunderstanding. However, the author could have been more communicative before ordering. Did he specify that he wanted the pizza as ordered? If she had a different preference, maybe he should have ordered her a separate pizza. \n\nIn some relationships, sharing food is common, but if she changes it without discussion, that's an issue. The author's anger might stem from feeling his choice was disregarded. But the fight over it might be disproportionate. However, the girlfriend's response of dismissing his feelings as childish could be part of the problem too. \n\nOverall, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend modified the food without discussion. But his reaction might have been harsh. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he had a legitimate grievance about her altering the pizza he paid for, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
