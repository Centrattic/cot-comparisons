It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the narrator ordered a specific pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of what he gets. Then, after he ate two slices, he went to the kitchen and found she had taken the toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. She was confused and said he was overreacting.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend might have assumed that splitting the pizza wasn't a big deal, especially since she agreed to have some of his order. However, when she took toppings off every piece, that could be seen as being inconsiderate, especially since he was the one who ordered it and was looking forward to it. \n\nBut wait, did he communicate clearly that he expected to share the pizza? He asked her if she wanted anything, but maybe she thought he was just being polite and didn't expect her to partake. Alternatively, maybe she took it as her own share by taking toppings off, thinking it was okay because he already had two slices. \n\nOn the flip side, he ordered the pizza specifically, which might mean he expected to have it his way. Her altering the pizza without asking could be seen as selfish. But maybe she didn't realize how much he was looking forward to it. \n\nThe argument escalated because of different expectations. The narrator's reaction was anger, which might be seen as over the top, but if he communicated his expectations clearly, maybe not. However, she might have felt that since he had already eaten two slices, she was entitled to take some toppings. \n\nI think the main issue here is communication. The narrator could have specified that he wanted the pizza as is, or maybe she should have asked before altering it. But given that he was the one who ordered it and was craving it, his anger might be justified. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish and a child) might have been harsh. \n\nSo, is the narrator in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his expectations clearly, maybe he shares some responsibility. But if she took the pizza without considering his preferences, she might be at fault. The question is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Since he was the one who ordered the pizza and was looking forward to it, his anger isn't entirely unwarranted. However, arguing over it and escalating to name-calling could be his fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the narrator's anger isn't entirely out of line. The problem is more on her side for altering the pizza without considering his preferences.\n"
