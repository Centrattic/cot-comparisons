It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, then when he went to get more in the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author thought the girlfriend would just take a piece or some toppings from one or two slices. But she took from all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought since he had already taken two pieces, the rest was fair game for her to use as she pleased. She didn't take everything off, just some toppings and cheese, so she considered it fine. The author's frustration might be because he felt the pizza was a special treat he wanted, and she altered it for all the pieces, which could affect his experience. The girlfriend might feel entitled to the food in the kitchen, especially since she said she didn't want a whole piece.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I have to consider if the author's reaction was justified. Anger over someone taking toppings from all the pizza slices when you ordered it for yourself\u2014maybe that's overreacting. But if the author was really craving that specific pizza and the alteration made it less enjoyable, his reaction could be seen as reasonable. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't see the issue, but that doesn't mean she was right. Communication seems to be a problem here. The author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the toppings intact, so maybe he should have set clearer expectations. However, the girlfriend's actions might still be seen as inconsiderate if she knew how much he wanted the pizza and still took from all the pieces, even if he had two slices left. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are communication, shared resources, and the level of consideration each person had for the other's preferences. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better without escalating. The girlfriend's actions were probably inconsiderate, but her misunderstanding the author's intent could also play a role. So, based on the options, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
