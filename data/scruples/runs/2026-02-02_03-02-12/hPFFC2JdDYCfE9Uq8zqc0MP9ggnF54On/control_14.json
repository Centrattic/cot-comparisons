It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it, despite it being a bit more expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever the author got. The author took two slices, went to watch TV, and when they went to the kitchen, found that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nSo the main conflict is about the girlfriend's actions of removing toppings from all the pizza pieces. The author got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and the argument escalated. The girlfriend was confused and accused the author of overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author clearly wanted the pizza from a specific place, which they considered worth the money. They ordered it and assumed their girlfriend would take toppings from one or two slices, which is a common practice when sharing a pizza. However, the girlfriend took from every piece, which the author found inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since she didn't want a whole piece, she could take toppings from multiple slices to get what she wanted without eating an entire slice. The author's assumption was that she would take from one or two, but she took from all. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified.\n\nThe author's frustration comes from perceiving the girlfriend's action as selfish. They paid for the pizza, and the girlfriend altered the food in a way they didn't expect. The girlfriend, however, didn't take all the toppings off each piece and was confused about the anger. She might not have realized that the author expected her to limit herself to a certain number of slices. \n\nConsidering communication, the author could have clarified their expectations when ordering. But the girlfriend's action was unexpected and potentially disrespectful of the author's preferences. However, the author's response of calling her selfish and inconsiderate, and escalating to a big argument, might have been an overreaction. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. If the author had specified that they wanted to eat two slices and the rest to be left as is, the girlfriend might have acted differently. But since the author didn't, the girlfriend's interpretation was different. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying every piece could be seen as taking more than what's reasonable, even if she didn't take a whole slice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author didn't set clear boundaries, and the girlfriend didn't consider the impact of her actions. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the argument was started by the author's anger over the modified pizza, and if the girlfriend's actions were indeed taking from all the pieces, the author might feel justified. However, reacting with anger and calling the girlfriend names could be seen as the author's fault for not handling the situation calmly. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's anger was disproportionate. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response might have been too harsh. The author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's a balance here. Maybe the author's initial reaction started the fight, but there's context where the girlfriend was inconsiderate. However, according to the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) framework, the key is whether the author acted unreasonably. If the author overreacted, then they might be the one at fault. But if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish and the author is justified in their anger, then maybe not. \n\nI think the main issue is the author's assumption about what the girlfriend meant by \"some of the toppings.\" Without clear communication, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take as she pleased. The author's anger over the modified pizza isn't entirely out of line, but the way they reacted\u2014calling her names and escalating the argument\u2014could be the problem. So the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if they felt upset. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were genuinely taking from every piece, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn many AITA cases, the person who starts the argument with harsh words is often considered the asshole. The author went into the kitchen expecting the pizza to be as they left it, and when they found it altered, they reacted strongly. The girlfriend might have been inconsiderate, but the author's response of anger and name-calling is the immediate cause of the fight. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for initiating the confrontation in a harsh manner, even if the situation was frustrating. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the issue with their reaction rather than addressing it calmly first.\n"
