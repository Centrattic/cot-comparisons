It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the situation is about a couple arguing over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it, even though it's a bit pricey. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would have some of whatever he ordered. Then when the pizza arrived, he took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, and when she came back he asked why she wasn't eating. She said she took some toppings off, but he found out she had taken toppings and cheese from all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The girlfriend said she would have some of what he ordered, which might imply she expected to share it. But he ordered for himself, assuming she might take a piece. But when she modified the pizza instead of taking a piece, he was upset. She thought it was fine because he had his own pieces, and she didn't take all the cheese. He felt she was being selfish by altering the pizza instead of taking a piece.\n\nFirst, maybe the author should have considered that if she wasn't going to eat a full piece, maybe she didn't want to take one, but taking toppings off all the pieces is a bit extreme. However, she did say she would have some of what he ordered. If she wanted to eat it, she could have taken a piece and then modified it, but taking from all the pieces might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a strong reaction. Maybe the author overreacted, but maybe not. It depends on their usual interactions. If she often does things that are inconsiderate, this might be a pattern. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author's main issue is that she altered the pizza he paid for without considering his feelings. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response was to call her selfish and escalate into a big argument. However, the author was within his rights to be upset if he felt the pizza was for sharing. The problem is that the girlfriend didn't communicate her needs and modified the pizza without discussing. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he did ask if she wanted anything and she said she would have some of his order. He might have expected her to take a piece rather than modify all of them. But maybe he should have checked if she wanted to take a piece before ordering. However, she said she would have some, so he ordered. Then she altered all the pizza, which is a problem. The author's anger is about the selfish act, but calling her selfish and getting into a big argument might be overreacting. But given that it's about something as simple as pizza, maybe the author is overreacting, but the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. \n\nHmm, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he was expecting her to share the pizza, and she modified it without considering his feelings. But maybe he could have handled it more calmly. The girlfriend's actions were selfish, but the author's response might have been harsh. So perhaps the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but maybe there's room for both to be at least a little in the wrong. However, based on the question, which asks if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B.\n"
