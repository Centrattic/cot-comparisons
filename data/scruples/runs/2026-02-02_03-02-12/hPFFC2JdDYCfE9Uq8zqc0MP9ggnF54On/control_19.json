It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place they wanted, told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her some. She said she'd have some of what he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. They argued, he called her selfish, she said he was overreacting.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. The author ordered the pizza, maybe expecting it to be shared. When he ordered, he asked her if she wanted anything, so she said she'd have some of what he got. But when he went to get more, she had modified all the pizza. He was upset because he thought she meant taking toppings off a couple pieces, not all of them. She didn't think it was a big deal, said he already had his pieces.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe he should have considered that there might be a misunderstanding. When she said she didn't want a whole piece, maybe he could have clarified if she wanted to take some toppings from one or two slices. Instead, she took from all pieces, which he found inconsiderate. He then called her selfish and they fought. But he was the one who ordered the pizza, so maybe he should have expected that she might take some? Or is it unreasonable for her to take all the toppings off, leaving it inedible for him?\n\nWait, the author says she didn't take all the cheese off, but the pizza is still fine to eat. That's her side. He found it inconsiderate. But maybe she thought it was her pizza now since he offered it to her? Or maybe he should have ordered separate pizzas if he wanted his specific way. But he didn't, he ordered his favorite place and expected her to take some. She might have thought she could do with hers as she pleased. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was communication. He thought she meant taking a little from a couple slices, but she took from all. He was upset because he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. So he's upset about the modification. But is that a valid reason to start a fight? The question is about whether he was in the wrong for getting angry. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the author should have clarified her intention to take toppings off. But she didn't ask, she just did. He might feel it's his choice how his ordered pizza is prepared. However, if he ordered it for both of them, expecting her to take some, but she altered all of it, maybe that's selfish. But then again, maybe she thought it was a way to get what she wanted without him having to order separately. \n\nSo, the author is upset because she didn't consider his preferences after he had already ordered. He might feel ownership over the pizza he paid for. However, he did offer her some, so perhaps she had the right to modify her own portion. The fight might have been avoidable if he had communicated better, but she did something that changed the food he wanted to eat. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author could have been more clear about his expectations, but she went ahead and altered all the pizza without checking with him. However, the fact that he called her selfish and they escalated into a big argument might be his fault. Maybe the initial anger is justified, but the way he handled it could be seen as overreacting. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he could have managed the situation better, or B (not in the wrong) because she was inconsiderate. \n\nLooking at the story again, the author ordered the pizza for himself and offered her some. She agreed. Then she took toppings off all pieces. He was upset because he thought she meant a couple pieces. She didn't think it was a big deal. He called her selfish. The question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). Because she took all the toppings and cheese off, which he found selfish. He had a right to be upset if he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. But maybe he should have ordered two different pizzas. Alternatively, she should have discussed her changes with him. But in the argument, he was the one who called her selfish and got angry, which might be justified if she did something inconsiderate. However, the fight might have been his fault for blowing it out of proportion. \n\nWait, the user says the author called her selfish and she accused him of acting like a child. The answer options are whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger was reasonable, then he's not in the wrong. If it was overreacting, then he is. The key is whether taking the toppings off all the pizza was inconsiderate. If yes, then he's not in the wrong. If no, then he is. \n\nIn this case, she took the toppings off every piece, which he finds inconsiderate. She didn't communicate that she wanted to do that. So he's justified in being upset. Therefore, answer B (No, he's not in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground where both are at fault. However, the options are A or B. So based on the story, the answer is B.\n"
