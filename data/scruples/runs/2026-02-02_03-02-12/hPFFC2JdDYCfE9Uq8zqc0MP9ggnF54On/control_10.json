It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a couple having a fight over pizza. The author ordered an expensive pizza from their favorite place because they were craving it. They offered the pizza to their girlfriend, who initially said she would just have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, then went to the living room. Later, he found out that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece, not just a few as he thought. He got angry, called her selfish, and they ended up arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he paid for the pizza, ordered it because he wanted it, and expected to share it. When he found out she had altered all the pieces, he felt it was selfish, especially since he had already eaten two. The girlfriend's perspective, according to the author, was that she didn't take all the cheese and didn't see the problem since the author had already had his share. She got defensive and accused him of overreacting.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations and communication. The author didn't specify when he ordered the pizza whether he wanted to share it or not. He assumed she wanted some, but maybe didn't clarify that the pizza was for both. The girlfriend might have thought she could take what she wanted since he had already had his first pieces. Also, she did take some toppings off, but maybe not all, so from her side, it's just rearranging to her taste. However, altering the pizza that someone else ordered might not be considerate, especially if the author values the specific toppings and presentation.\n\nBut was the author wrong? He did order the pizza with the idea that they would share it, but perhaps didn't make that clear. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions in modifying the entire pizza could be seen as inconsiderate. The fight started when the author felt his order was being altered without his input. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness might stem from not realizing how important the pizza was to him. Alternatively, maybe she was trying to save money by not getting her own order but ended up messing up his.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both sides have some. The author could have clarified that he wanted to keep the pizza as ordered, and the girlfriend could have communicated her need for different toppings. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he was angry over the modifications and called her selfish, that might be justified if he expected to share the pizza as is. However, if she thought she had the right to alter it since he already had his first pieces, then his reaction might be seen as over the top. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer likely depends on cultural norms around sharing and personal boundaries. In some contexts, altering someone else's order is rude, but in others, it's acceptable if they're sharing. Given that the pizza was expensive and specifically ordered, the author's reaction might be more understandable. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the author could have handled it more calmly without name-calling. But the core issue is whether he was wrong, and since he ordered it for sharing and she altered it without asking, he's justified in feeling angry. So the answer is B.\n"
