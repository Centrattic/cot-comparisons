It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza incident. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author really wanted pizza from a specific place, which is a bit expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, took two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, then came back without eating. The author asked, and she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. He thought she took toppings off one or two pieces. But when he went to the kitchen, he found all the toppings and cheese chunks removed from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's actions: He ordered the pizza he craved, took two pieces, and didn't consider the possibility that his girlfriend would take toppings off all the remaining pieces. The girlfriend's actions were unexpected. She didn't communicate that she wanted to have toppings off all the pizza, which might not be a typical way to share. \n\nThe girlfriend said she would have some of whatever he got, which the author took to mean she would take a piece or two. But she ended up modifying all the remaining pizza, which the author found inconsiderate. The author's anger stems from feeling that she was selfish, not sharing, and altering the pizza he paid for. \n\nBut was the author wrong to react that way? Well, maybe the author didn't consider that the girlfriend might have different preferences. However, when someone orders food, especially a specific type they crave, altering it without communication could be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend might have thought she was saving money by not having to order her own pizza, but that's not considering the author's preferences. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed the girlfriend would take a piece or two, but she did something entirely different. The girlfriend didn't clarify her needs, leading to a misunderstanding. The author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which might be a bit strong, but the situation was frustrating. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a close call. The author could have asked for clarification if they noticed the girlfriend wasn't eating, but they were watching TV and didn't think much of it. The girlfriend's actions were unexpected and inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have escalated the situation. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
