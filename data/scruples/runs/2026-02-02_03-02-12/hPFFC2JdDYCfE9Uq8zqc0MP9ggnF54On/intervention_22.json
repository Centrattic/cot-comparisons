It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, let me summarize the situation. The person ordered a pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend and asked if she wanted anything, and she said no but would have some of whatever he gets. He orders the pizza, eats two slices, then goes to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time and when she comes back, he asks why she's not eating. She says she took toppings off some pieces. He thought she took toppings off one or two, but instead she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument with past issues coming up.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to decide if the author is right or wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The girlfriend said she would have some of whatever he gets. But when he returned, she had taken toppings off all the pieces. The author was upset because he thought she was being selfish. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Did she actually take the pizza without asking? She said she didn't want a whole piece, just toppings. Maybe she thought it was okay to take from the pizza without a slice. But the author might have expected her to either take a slice or not touch it. The fact that she took toppings from every piece could be seen as taking without consideration for his preference. However, maybe the author didn't communicate clearly. When he ordered the pizza, he might have assumed it was for both of them, but she might have thought he was eating it himself. The argument escalates because he calls her selfish, which might be an overreaction. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, but the author's response leading to a big argument might be the main issue. The key is whether the author's anger was justified. Since it's a minor thing (pizza), escalating to a big fight might be disproportionate. But the girlfriend's actions could also be seen as selfish. So, the question is, who is more at fault? The author for overreacting, or the girlfriend for being inconsiderate. In AITA scenarios, usually, the person who's more in the wrong is the one whose actions directly caused the problem. The girlfriend took the pizza without considering that the author might prefer whole slices. The author's anger might be justified, but escalating to a fight is his choice. So maybe the author is partially at fault for blowing it out of proportion. But the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I'm a bit torn here. The girlfriend's actions were probably inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might be the main issue. So perhaps the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the fight was over a minor issue and he chose to escalate it. Or B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were selfish. In AITA stories, often the person who is more in the wrong is the one who did the action. But here, the author didn't do anything wrong except getting angry. Wait, the girlfriend took the pizza without asking again. Maybe the author should have been more clear about his expectations. For example, if he ordered pizza for both, but didn't specify that he wanted the slices to stay whole. So maybe the author didn't communicate well, leading to misunderstanding. Therefore, he might be at fault for not setting boundaries. But the girlfriend took it without asking, which is also inconsiderate. It's a bit of a grey area. I think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and his anger is a response to her behavior. However, escalating to a big fight might be his fault. But in the story, the author says he was angry because of her selfishness, and she got defensive. The question is whether his anger was justified. Since pizza isn't a big deal, maybe the fight was his fault for overreacting. Alternatively, if she was being selfish, then he's right to be upset. I'm going to lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend took from the pizza without considering his preferences, and his reaction was to the selfish act, not the pizza itself. So answer B.\n"
