It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. The author ordered pizza because they were craving it and asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said she'd just have some of whatever they got. Then when the pizza arrived, the author took two pieces, left the rest. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she had taken toppings off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The author thought the girlfriend would take toppings off one or two pieces, but she did it to every piece. The girlfriend was confused and thought it was okay since the author had already taken their share. The author felt wronged because they wanted to eat the pizza as is, and the girlfriend's action ruined it for them. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, the author ordered the pizza, but the girlfriend was invited to take something. However, the problem is that the girlfriend didn't take just a little, but modified all the pieces. That's a lot, and maybe the author felt like their order was being altered without consent. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken their share, she had the right to adjust the remaining pizza. But the author might have expected the pizza to stay intact unless she wanted some of her own, which she didn't initially. \n\nThe girlfriend's action of removing toppings and cheese from every piece could be seen as overstepping. Even if she didn't take the whole pizza, changing the remaining pieces that the author wanted to eat could be inconsiderate. The author's anger might be a reaction to not being consulted about altering the food they paid for. However, the girlfriend might feel that since they were sharing, she had the right to adjust it. \n\nAlso, the author called her selfish and said she acted inconsiderate, which might have escalated the argument. The girlfriend's response of calling the author childish suggests that both sides felt the other was wrong. But the main issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. \n\nI think the author's anger is understandable because their order was changed without their knowledge. However, maybe they could have communicated better beforehand. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but maybe the author didn't consider that she might want a different version of the pizza. Still, altering the food that the author wanted to eat without consent is a problem. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the girlfriend is more in the wrong for changing the pizza without asking, but the author's reaction might have been a bit harsh. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if their anger was justified. The answer might be B (No) because the author's reaction, while intense, was in response to an inconsiderate act. Or maybe A (Yes) if the author should have communicated better or considered that their girlfriend might want to adjust the pizza without taking the whole share. \n\nBut given that the girlfriend removed toppings from every piece, which the author had paid for and wanted to eat as is, the author's frustration is valid. The girlfriend's action was selfish in a way, not just taking a piece but modifying all of them. So the author isn't entirely wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
