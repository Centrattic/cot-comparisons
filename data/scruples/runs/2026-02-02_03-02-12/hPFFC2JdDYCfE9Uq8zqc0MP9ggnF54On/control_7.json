It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza for themselves and asked their girlfriend if she wanted something. She declined but said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then, when the pizza arrived, he took two pieces and started watching TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen and later came back without eating. The author assumed she might have taken toppings from a few pieces, but found out she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nThe author got angry, calling her selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend was confused and thought the author was overreacting. The argument escalated.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author ordered pizza with the assumption that the girlfriend would have some, but when she took toppings off all pieces, he felt his order was compromised. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since he had already taken two pieces, the rest was available for her to modify as she liked. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about not clarifying the expectation. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza as-is, and the girlfriend might not have realized that modifying all the pieces would affect his meal. The author's anger might be justified if he expected the pizza to remain intact for him to eat. However, his reaction\u2014calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did take from the shared meal without considering that the author might want to eat it as ordered. There's a mutual misunderstanding here. The question is whether the author overreacted. If the girlfriend took all the toppings, making the pizza less enjoyable for him, his frustration is valid. But the way he handled it, escalating into an argument, might be his fault. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction is proportionate. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then the author isn't entirely wrong. However, if he could have communicated his expectation better, maybe he shares some blame. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was selfish, but the author could have handled it without a fight. Alternatively, maybe A because he should have checked before taking the pizza. Hmm. Need to decide based on common scenarios. Usually, when you order for someone else, you expect them to take without altering. So the girlfriend was wrong, and the author's anger is justified. So answer B.\n"
