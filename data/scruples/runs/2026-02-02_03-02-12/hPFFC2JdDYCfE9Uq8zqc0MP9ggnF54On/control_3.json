It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it, even though it's a bit expensive. They told their girlfriend they were ordering and offered her some. She said she'd take some of whatever he got. Then he ate two pieces, went back to the living room, and when he checked later, she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought she meant she would take a few pieces or maybe take some toppings off one or two. But she actually took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. She thought he was overreacting.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, maybe he assumed she would take a certain way, but she didn't communicate her actions. On the other hand, she did take his pizza, which he paid for, and modified it in a way he didn't expect. He might feel disrespected or that she didn't consider his feelings. But arguing over this and calling her names might escalate things unnecessarily. Maybe they both have some responsibility here. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nHe did order the pizza and offered her a share, but maybe he should have checked if she wanted to eat it before finishing his own pieces. Also, when he found out what she did, reacting with anger and calling her selfish might be a problem. She might not have realized the impact of her actions. Alternatively, her taking the toppings off all the pieces without asking could be selfish. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The author could have asked her if she wanted to eat before finishing his own slices. Instead, he assumed she would take a piece or two. Then, when he saw the modified pizza, his reaction was harsh. So maybe he's partially at fault for not clarifying and for overreacting. But she's also at fault for taking his food without permission. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did take two pieces first, maybe he should have considered that she might want some too. But the bigger issue is his reaction. He called her names and escalated the argument. That's probably where he went wrong. So the answer might be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
