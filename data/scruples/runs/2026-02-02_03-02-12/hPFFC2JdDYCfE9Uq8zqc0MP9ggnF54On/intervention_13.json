It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to get more, found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was looking forward to this specific pizza all day, which is more expensive but worth it to him. He ordered it intending to share, as she said she wanted some. Then, the girlfriend didn't eat anything initially, but when he went to the kitchen, she had taken off toppings and cheese from all the pieces. The author felt she was being selfish by taking the toppings, even though she had already eaten some. The girlfriend thought he was overreacting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza with the understanding that she would have some. She ended up taking the toppings from all the pieces, which left him with less to eat, maybe even affecting the taste and value of the pizza he paid for. The author's frustration is about the selfish act of taking from the pizza after he already had some. However, he did eat first, and maybe he should have considered that she might take some. But she took from every piece, which might not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. Maybe he could have communicated better instead of immediately getting angry. But the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all the pieces without leaving any intact for him seems inconsiderate. The author might feel that his craving and the expense were not respected. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend might have thought she could take some toppings, but not realizing how much it would bother him. The author's reaction might be based on feeling that his sacrifice to get that pizza was not respected. However, maybe he could have been more understanding if she had taken just a small amount from a couple of pieces instead of all. But she took from every piece, which seems excessive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have checked on the pizza earlier to ensure there was enough left for him, but he might not have expected her to take all the toppings. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was to call her selfish and argue, which might have been a harsh reaction. However, the act of taking the toppings was the initial issue. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He had a right to be upset about the pizza being ruined for him. But his response might have been a bit harsh. However, the main issue was her action, so I lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
