It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza because they were craving it. They offered the pizza to their girlfriend, who said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and she was in the kitchen for a while. When he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nNow, who's at fault here? The author's perspective is that his girlfriend didn't eat the pizza he ordered for her and instead messed with what he bought, making him angry. She thought it was fine because she didn't take all the cheese and he had his own pieces. The author feels justified in getting angry over her actions, seeing it as selfish. She, on the other hand, didn't see it as a big deal.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that ordering the pizza meant she would eat it as is, or maybe take a few toppings off one or two slices, but she went further by removing toppings from every piece. The author might feel that his craving and the expense were not respected. However, she might have thought that since he ordered it for her, she could eat it how she wanted, even if it was his choice of pizza. \n\nThe author's anger might be in part because of not discussing the situation beforehand. He ordered it without confirming if she wanted to eat it that way. He also took two pieces first, which could imply he expected the rest to be left for himself. But she might have thought since he ordered it for her, she could adjust it to her taste without affecting him since he had already taken some. \n\nHowever, her action of altering all the pizza's pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the author was looking forward to eating it the original way. But maybe the author should have considered that she might not like it as much, or that he should have ordered what they both wanted. Also, the fight escalated quickly, and the author used harsh words (\"selfish\") which might have been unnecessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's confusion and not seeing the issue might indicate she didn't think she was being inconsiderate. Maybe the author overreacted, but the initial action of altering the pizza without discussion could be a problem. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his anger was justified. If the girlfriend altered the pizza in a way that the author felt was disrespecting his choice or effort, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he didn't communicate his expectations and she had the right to adjust it, maybe he overreacted. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes things like this escalate because of poor communication. The author could have asked if she wanted a specific type of pizza instead of assuming. The girlfriend might not have realized that adjusting all the pizza would bother him. However, her actions of modifying all the pizza could be seen as inconsiderate, given the expense and the author's craving. \n\nSo, both might have some responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is wrong for overreacting. If B, then the author isn't wrong because the girlfriend was selfish. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were selfish, but maybe the author could have handled it better. However, the key is that she did something that altered what he ordered, possibly without considering his feelings. The author's anger is about his own investment in the pizza, which might be valid. So, maybe B is correct.\n"
