It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece. They got angry, called her selfish, and an argument ensued.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. So he ordered the pizza. Then, after he took two slices, the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces. The author got upset because he thought she meant she'd take some toppings from one or two, not every piece. The girlfriend was confused and defensive, saying he got his slices and she didn't take all the cheese off.\n\nNow, determining fault. The main issue is whether the author overreacted. The girlfriend did take toppings off all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. But maybe there's a miscommunication here. The author assumed she'd only take some from a couple of slices, but she did all. However, the girlfriend might have thought that since he ordered it, she could adjust it as she liked. The author might be inconsiderate by not checking if she wanted to modify the pizza before eating two slices. But on the other hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions, which led to the conflict. \n\nWas it selfish? The girlfriend took from the remaining pizza, which the author had already ordered. Maybe she didn't think about the fact that he paid for it and wanted to enjoy it as is. However, if he had checked after ordering or they had discussed how they wanted the pizza, maybe the issue could have been avoided. The author's anger might be overreacting because the girlfriend didn't take all the pizza, just modified it. But the act of taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a harsh reaction. The girlfriend might have had the right to adjust the pizza to her taste, but maybe she should have communicated better. The author's responsibility is to ensure that both parties are comfortable with the shared food. However, the key point is that the author didn't confirm how she wanted the pizza after ordering, leading to the misunderstanding. \n\nConsidering all that, the fault might be on both sides. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he reacted angrily and escalated the situation, perhaps he's at fault for not being more understanding. The girlfriend might have been inconsiderate, but the author's response was also inappropriate. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he overreacted and maybe didn't consider her preferences upfront. Alternatively, maybe B because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user wants a choice between A and B. The main factors are communication. The author didn't check if she wanted toppings removed before eating, and she didn't communicate her actions. But since she modified the food without discussing, maybe she's at fault. However, the author's response was to call her selfish and escalate the argument. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for overreacting. But the initial act of taking the toppings could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up. In many cases, these scenarios are seen as a 50-50, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is. If B, then not. Given the options, maybe the answer is A because the author's reaction was disproportionate, even if the girlfriend did something inconsiderate. So the author is in the wrong for starting the fight over it.\n"
