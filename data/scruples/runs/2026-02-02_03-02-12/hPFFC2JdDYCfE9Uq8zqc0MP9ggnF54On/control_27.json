It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific pizza they were craving because it's a bit expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever he gets. Then he orders it, eats two pieces, goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, then comes back not eating. He asks why, and she says she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. He thought she took toppings off a couple of pieces, but when he went to the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece.\n\nHe gets angry, calls her selfish and inconsiderate. She gets defensive, says he's acting like a child. They argue, bringing up other issues. The author feels justified because he thinks her action was selfish, but she didn't take all the cheese. The question is, was he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, let's look at his actions. He ordered the pizza he wanted, which he had craved all day. He offered her to have some, which she accepted. He ate two pieces, which is reasonable, especially since he was starving. Then she comes back and messes with the remaining pizza. But did she ask first? He might have expected her to just take a piece or not take any, but instead she altered the pizza in a way that messed up his order. He was expecting to have the pizza as it was, but she changed it, maybe affecting his enjoyment since he paid for it and it's his preference. However, he didn't check on her before eating his own slices. She was in the kitchen for a while, and he didn't notice until later. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions: she said she didn't want a whole piece, so she took toppings off every single piece. Maybe she thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole pizza, but ended up altering it in a way that made it less enjoyable for him. But did she have the right to do that without consulting him? If she wanted to modify the pizza, maybe she should have asked first. However, he might have assumed she would just take a piece or not take any, so her action was unexpected. \n\nHis reaction: he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a bit harsh. She did take some of the cheese, but not all. The argument escalates, bringing up other issues. Maybe he overreacted in terms of the intensity, but the action itself\u2014getting angry over someone messing with his order\u2014could be seen as reasonable. However, since he asked her if she wanted anything and she said no, maybe he shouldn't have expected her to modify the pizza. On the other hand, she might have thought she was being helpful by not taking a whole piece. \n\nIs he in the wrong? If he ordered the pizza he wanted, paid for it, and she altered it without asking, then he's not wrong for being upset. However, maybe he could have communicated better. If he had set boundaries\u2014like \"I want this pizza as is, please don't modify it\"\u2014then she might have known not to do it. But he didn't specify that. Alternatively, if he had offered her to take a piece or not, but she decided to modify all of them, maybe he's justified in feeling that she was inconsiderate. However, calling her selfish and inconsiderate and escalating to a big argument might be overreacting. \n\nSo, the author's anger is about the selfishness of her action, but maybe he didn't consider that she was trying to share the pizza in her own way. However, modifying every piece is extreme. He might not be in the wrong for being angry, but perhaps his reaction was too harsh. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. If he's not wrong for being upset, but his reaction was over the top, then maybe he's partially at fault. However, in many such situations, both parties can have some responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that she didn't ask and modified the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment, he's not entirely in the wrong. However, the way he handled it\u2014calling her selfish and inconsiderate\u2014might have been aggressive. So there's a balance. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had a right to be upset, but maybe the argument was mutual. However, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. Since the act of starting the fight by getting angry is in question. If the action was something that was his property (the pizza he paid for), then he's not wrong. But if his reaction was disproportionate, then maybe he is. \n\nIn the end, considering the context, the author's anger is about his own property being altered without consent, which is a valid concern. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
