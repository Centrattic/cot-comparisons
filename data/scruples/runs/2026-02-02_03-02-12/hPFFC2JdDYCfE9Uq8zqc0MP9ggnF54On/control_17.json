It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a specific pizza, ate two slices, and then found out that their girlfriend took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. The girlfriend thought it wasn't a big deal because she only took some toppings, not all. The argument escalated with the author calling her selfish and the girlfriend saying the author was being a child.\n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is communication. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, and later found out she took toppings off every piece. But he didn't check if she had taken some before he ate his own. So maybe he assumed she would take a piece or two, but she took toppings off all. That could be a problem. The girlfriend's actions were definitely inconsiderate, taking toppings off every piece left would make the remaining pizza less enjoyable for the author. But the author didn't check if she had taken something before he ate his own. So maybe he didn't communicate his expectations clearly. Also, when he found out, he called her selfish and got angry. The girlfriend was confused and thought it wasn't a big deal. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? He did order the pizza, and the girlfriend said she'd eat some of it. But taking toppings off all pieces is pretty selfish. However, the author could have been more clear that he expected her to take a whole piece or at least leave some pizza as is. Maybe he should have checked if she wanted to take some when the pizza arrived instead of just grabbing two pieces. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of what was happening. But the action of taking toppings off every piece is definitely inconsiderate. So maybe the author is not entirely wrong, but his reaction could have been better. The key point is that the girlfriend's action was selfish, but the author could have handled it with more communication. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish and inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been a bit over the top. However, the main issue was her taking toppings off all the pieces, which the author had a right to be upset about. So the answer is B.\n"
