It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out their girlfriend took toppings and cheese from all the remaining pizza pieces in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and the argument escalated. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author ordered pizza, told their girlfriend they were going to get it, and she said she'd have some of whatever. Then she ended up taking toppings and cheese off every piece. The author found that offensive and got angry. The girlfriend didn't seem to understand the issue and even said she didn't take all the cheese. The author feels justified in being upset about selfishness, but others might see it as overreacting.\n\nNow, to analyze both sides. The author's perspective is that the girlfriend took without asking and altered the pizza in a way that made it less enjoyable. They might feel their effort to share was disregarded. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see it as her being thrifty or using what's available, especially if there were leftovers. She didn't take all the cheese, just some, so maybe she thought it was still edible. The argument might have been about differing values\u2014author wanted to share as ordered, girlfriend saw it as practical.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, getting angry over something perceived as inconsiderate is understandable. However, starting a fight might have been unnecessary. The key is whether the reaction was proportionate. The author called the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which could be seen as harsh. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't realize the impact of her actions. The argument escalated into bringing up other issues, which complicates things. \n\nSo, maybe both sides have some responsibility. The author could have communicated better instead of immediately accusing her. The girlfriend could have asked before taking or discussed her preference. The author might not be entirely wrong for feeling upset, but the way the conflict was handled could be improved. In terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area, but since the question is a yes or no, the answer would depend on whether the author's anger was justified. Since the user's question is about being in the wrong, if the author took the first step to confront and escalate, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, the author isn't wrong. Hmm. I think the answer is B (No), because the author's reaction, while perhaps heated, stems from a reasonable expectation of sharing and consideration. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
