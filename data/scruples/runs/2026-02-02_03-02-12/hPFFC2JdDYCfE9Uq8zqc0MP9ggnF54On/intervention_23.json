It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a fight over pizza is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author ordered pizza from a specific, expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he gets. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and later found out she had taken toppings off every piece in the kitchen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that since he went through the trouble and expense of getting pizza he really wanted, it's unfair that his girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, possibly ruining his experience. She might feel that since he already had his pieces, taking some toppings from the remaining pizza isn't a big deal. She even mentions she didn't take all the cheese off, implying it's still edible. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to stay intact for his enjoyment. He assumed she would take only a little from one or two pieces. She, on the other hand, might not have realized the extent of his preference. The argument escalated when he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which could be seen as an overreaction if she didn't intend to be selfish. However, her action did affect his enjoyment of the pizza he paid for, which he was looking forward to. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if he didn't communicate his expectations clearly, maybe part of the fault lies with him. He didn't explicitly say he wanted the pizza to stay whole. But on the other hand, taking toppings off every piece is a significant action that would impact his experience. The girlfriend might not realize the importance he placed on the pizza's condition. \n\nIn terms of the argument's escalation, calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have been a harsh reaction, especially since she was confused and thought it wasn't a big deal. However, his frustration is understandable given the expense and his personal desire for the pizza. \n\nI think the main issue is a lack of communication on both sides. The author didn't set clear boundaries, and the girlfriend didn't consider how her actions would affect his enjoyment. But in terms of who is more at fault, the author's reaction might be seen as over the top because it's just pizza, but his frustration has a basis in his personal preferences. However, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate in that she altered the pizza without considering his preferences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at the actions, both contributed to the conflict. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his expectations and reacted harshly, he shares some fault. But the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, which might align more with the idea that the girlfriend's action was the main issue. However, considering the argument's escalation, the author's response could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. His anger stems from unmet expectations and personal preferences, and while his reaction might be intense, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. However, there's a balance here. Alternatively, if the answer is A, it's because he didn't communicate clearly and overreacted. But since the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, maybe B is correct.\n"
