It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered the pizza they wanted, and their girlfriend ended up taking toppings off every single piece. The author got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was looking forward to the pizza, maybe even excited because it's a specific place they like. They ordered it, ate two pieces, then went back and found the remaining pizza altered. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece, so she took toppings off all the pieces. But why would she do that? Maybe she wanted to avoid eating cheese or something, but why all the pieces?\n\nThe author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish. The girlfriend was confused and thought it was fine since she didn't take all the cheese. She also said he already had his pieces. But the author felt it was inconsiderate. Is that a valid feeling?\n\nWell, sharing food is a common thing. If someone orders pizza and expects it to be there as ordered, modifying it without asking might be an issue. The girlfriend didn't communicate her need to adjust the pizza, which could be seen as selfish. However, maybe she thought since he had already eaten some, it was okay. But taking toppings off all the pieces affects the remaining pizza the author was going to eat. That's probably where the author's frustration comes from.\n\nThe girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness might have escalated the situation. The author's anger, while perhaps over the top for just pizza, is understandable if they felt their meal was being compromised. But is the author entirely without fault? Maybe they could have communicated their feelings better, instead of calling her selfish and inconsiderate, which might have been harsh. However, the act of altering the pizza without discussion is on her side. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while maybe intense, is not entirely unwarranted. The author might have handled it differently, but the core issue is her modifying the pizza without talking to him. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
