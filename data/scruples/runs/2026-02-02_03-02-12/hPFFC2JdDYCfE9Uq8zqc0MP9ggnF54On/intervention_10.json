It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place, told their girlfriend they were going to order it, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, and when he checked the kitchen later, he found that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they ended up arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt that since he paid for the pizza and ordered it specifically, his girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. She, on the other hand, might have thought that since he had already taken two pieces, it was okay for her to take what she wanted from the remaining pizza. She might not have realized the extent of what she did or maybe thought it was a minor issue. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he didn't want her to take anything from the remaining pizza. He assumed she would take one or two pieces, not modify all of them. She might have thought that since he had his own portions, she could adjust the others as she pleased. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did start the argument by calling her selfish and escalating the situation. His reaction might have been overly harsh, especially since she didn't take all the cheese off, just some. However, his frustration is understandable if he had a specific craving and the pizza was expensive. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the author could have handled it calmly instead of calling her names. The argument escalated because he reacted emotionally. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate, the author's reaction might have been a bigger issue. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight, I think it's a mix. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong. Considering that the author didn't explicitly state his expectations and reacted strongly, maybe he shares some responsibility. But maybe not all of it. I need to decide between A or B. Since the question is about being in the wrong for starting the fight, and the fight was initiated by his reaction, perhaps he's not entirely wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the answer is B, no.\n"
