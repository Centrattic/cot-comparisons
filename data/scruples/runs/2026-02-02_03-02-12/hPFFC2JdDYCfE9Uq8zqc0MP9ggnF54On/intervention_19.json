It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author ordered a specific pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever they got. Then the author ordered, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while but didn't take any pizza. When the author asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off some pieces. But when the author went to the kitchen, they found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author assumed that \"just some of the toppings\" meant taking a little from a few pieces, but she actually took from all. The author might feel that her action was inconsiderate because she didn't leave any proper pizza for them. But was the author wrong to get angry?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had ordered the pizza specifically, maybe expecting to share it. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as not considering the author's need for a proper meal. However, the author did order the pizza intending to eat it themselves, and the girlfriend did eat some of the toppings. Maybe she just preferred it that way. The author's reaction might be over the top, but it's understandable if they felt like their meal was ruined. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Did they overreact? The girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by taking some toppings, expecting the author to have their own pieces. The author's anger might stem from a lack of communication. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza whole, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her actions. So maybe both sides have some fault here.\n\nWait, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), then the reasoning would be that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's anger is justified given the situation. However, if the author didn't consider that the pizza was for both of them to share, maybe they should have ordered two different pizzas. But the girlfriend did agree to have some of whatever he got. So maybe she expected to modify it to her taste without ruining the rest for him. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger might not be entirely wrong, but their reaction could have been more measured. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces might be seen as selfish. The key is whether it's reasonable to get angry over something that's not the end of the world. The user's point is that it's not the end of the world, but they feel justified. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is B (No), because the author's anger is a response to a perceived inconsiderate act, even if the situation could have been handled better. The girlfriend might not have communicated her needs, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling wronged.\n"
