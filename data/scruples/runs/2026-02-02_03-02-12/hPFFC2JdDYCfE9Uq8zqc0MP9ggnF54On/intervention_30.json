It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, then when they went to the kitchen, the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, she said he was being a child, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I should break down the points. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything when he ordered, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two slices. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she didn't eat. He asked why, and she said she took toppings off. He thought maybe she took from one or two pieces, but she took from every piece. He was angry, she was confused, called him a child. The author thinks she was selfish, but maybe he's overreacting?\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author assumed that since she said she'd have some of his pizza, she meant taking a piece or two. But she took toppings off all the pieces, which significantly altered the pizza. The author felt that was inconsiderate because he wanted to eat the pizza as it was, and she took away his ability to enjoy it properly. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't consider that she might have a different way of eating pizza, like just wanting the toppings. However, by taking chunks of cheese and toppings off all pieces, it's possible she left the pizza inedible or not to his liking. Communication might have been the issue here. He didn't check if she wanted a piece, just assumed she'd take from what he ordered. She didn't clarify her request properly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized how much she was affecting the author's meal by taking toppings off all pieces. If she had taken a couple of pieces, maybe it wouldn't have been a problem, but removing toppings from every piece is a lot more. \n\nThe author's reaction of calling her selfish and being angry might be disproportionate if he didn't communicate his expectations. But given that she altered all the pizza, maybe he wasn't wrong to be upset. However, maybe he could have handled it without yelling. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend might be at fault for not considering the author's preference to eat the pizza as ordered, but the author might also be at fault for not clearly communicating that he wanted to eat the pizza himself and that she shouldn't take from it. \n\nAlternatively, since she initially said she would eat some of his pizza, maybe she thought she could take from the existing pizza. But taking all the toppings off every piece changes the pizza entirely. So maybe the author is justified in being upset. \n\nI think the main issue is that there was a misunderstanding. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched for himself, and she didn't communicate how she wanted to eat it. Both might share some responsibility. However, the act of altering all the pizza could be seen as inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted. But his reaction might be over the top. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author ordered the pizza, ate two slices, and then the girlfriend altered the rest, which she had a right to do if it was communal. However, removing toppings from all pieces might be excessive. But perhaps the author could have ordered two separate pizzas if he wanted to eat without her altering it. \n\nAlternatively, since she said she'd eat some of his pizza, maybe she thought she could take from the existing one. The author might not have considered that she didn't want a whole piece but still needed to take some toppings. However, taking chunks off every piece is a lot. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions altered the pizza in a way that the author didn't expect and couldn't enjoy his meal. The author had a right to be upset since the pizza was ordered for both, and she modified it without considering his preferences. But maybe there's a middle ground where communication was lacking. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, so given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
