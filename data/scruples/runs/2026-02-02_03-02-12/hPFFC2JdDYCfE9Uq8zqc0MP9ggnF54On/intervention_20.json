It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nSo, the scenario: The person ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place. They told their girlfriend they were getting pizza and offered her some. She said she didn't want anything but would have some of what he gets. Then he ate two pieces, went to watch TV. His girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he went to get more, he found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: They were excited about getting a specific, expensive pizza, ordered it, shared with their girlfriend. When they found the pizza messed with, they were upset. The girlfriend said she just wanted some toppings, but ended up taking from all pieces. The author felt disrespected or inconsiderate because she took from the pizza, maybe without asking or communicating.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She said she wanted some toppings, which the author assumed meant taking a few pieces. She might have thought it was okay since she didn't take the whole piece, and the author had already had two pieces. She might not have realized the author would be so upset or that the pizza was so important. She thought it was still edible and didn't see the problem.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Was their reaction proportionate? The author felt the girlfriend was selfish. But maybe the girlfriend didn't intend to be inconsiderate. She might not have realized the significance of the pizza or that the author would be so upset. On the other hand, the author didn't check if the girlfriend wanted to share the pizza after ordering. The author assumed she would take a piece or two, but the girlfriend took from all pieces, which could be seen as taking without considering the author's preference.\n\nBut the author's anger led to a fight. The question is whether the anger was justified. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but maybe the author overreacted. However, the author's perspective is that they were inconsiderate and selfish. The girlfriend was confused and thought the author was overreacting.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author might have not clarified if they wanted to keep the pizza for themselves or how they wanted to share. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take toppings since the author had already had two pieces. The author's anger could be seen as a reaction to a miscommunication rather than the girlfriend's intent to be selfish.\n\nSo, if the author didn't communicate clearly about their expectations for sharing the pizza, maybe they have some responsibility. But the girlfriend did take from all pieces, which could be seen as taking without considering the author's enjoyment. However, the author's anger and calling her selfish might have escalated things unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a valid upset about their pizza being messed with. But they might have overreacted. The girlfriend also didn't consider the author's feelings by taking all the toppings. So, both have some fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering their actions and reaction, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was perhaps a bit over the top. However, the initial action of the girlfriend was the main issue. Alternatively, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for not communicating better.\n\nHmm. But the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Given the information, I think the answer is B. The author isn't entirely wrong because the girlfriend took from the pizza without considering the author's preferences. However, the author could have handled it differently. But in terms of who started the fight, the author did start it by getting angry, but the reason for the anger is the girlfriend's action. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
