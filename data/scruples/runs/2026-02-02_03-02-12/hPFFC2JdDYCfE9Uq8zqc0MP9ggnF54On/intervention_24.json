It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she didn't eat. The author asked why, and she said she took toppings off some pieces. But when he went to get more, he found that she had removed toppings and chunks of cheese from every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued, bringing up other issues. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective: he ordered pizza because he was starving, shared it with his girlfriend, and when he found out she had taken toppings off all the pieces, he felt it was inconsiderate and selfish. The girlfriend's perspective: she didn't take all the toppings, just some, and thought it was fine to eat. She was confused why he was angry and even got annoyed when he called her selfish, saying he was blowing things out of proportion.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that when the girlfriend said she wanted some of the toppings, she meant taking a bit off one or two pieces. However, she ended up removing toppings from every piece, which clearly went beyond what he intended. The girlfriend might not have realized how much she took, or maybe she didn't consider that the author would mind. But the author felt it was a selfish act, which led to the argument.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza for himself, but he offered to share. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces might have been inconsiderate, especially if the author didn't communicate clearly about how much he wanted her to take. However, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and start a big argument, which might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of her actions or how much the author valued the pizza.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author was the one who ordered the pizza and shared it. If he was okay with her taking some, but she took too much, maybe he should have communicated his boundaries earlier. However, the girlfriend didn't ask if she could take toppings; she just did it, which could be seen as not considering his feelings. The author's anger might be justified because the pizza was a specific, expensive place he was craving, and having it ruined could be frustrating.\n\nOn the other hand, the argument escalated because the author didn't handle it calmly. He called her names and brought up other issues, which is where things might go wrong. The girlfriend's confusion is valid because she didn't take all the toppings, just some. But the author's perspective is that she took too much, making the pizza not as good for him.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions in the argument were in the wrong because he reacted disproportionately and escalated the situation. However, the initial situation where the girlfriend took too much without considering the author's feelings is also at fault. But the question is about the author being in the wrong for starting the fight. Since he was the one who called her selfish and started the argument, maybe that's where he's at fault. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then the author's anger is justified, but his reaction was excessive.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the answer hinges on whether the argument was justified. If the author's anger was reasonable given the situation, then he's not in the wrong. But if his reaction was over the top, then he is. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger might be justified. However, how he handled it\u2014calling her names and escalating to a big argument\u2014might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), but there's nuance. The user's point is that getting angry over selfishness isn't out of proportion, but the way the argument was handled might be. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. The fight started when he called her selfish. So if the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then his reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
