It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over pizza.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from their girlfriend's suggested place because they were starving. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would take some of what he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, and when he went to get more, he found the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend asked for toppings from the pizza but didn't specify how much or that she wanted to take parts off existing pieces. The author assumed she would take a whole piece or part of one. However, the girlfriend took chunks off all pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's perspective is that she took what he had left, even though he had already eaten two pieces. The girlfriend thought she was being helpful but didn't realize the impact. The author's anger is about the perceived selfishness and lack of consideration. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe. He ordered the pizza, but the girlfriend's request wasn't clear. She said she would take some of the toppings, which the author interpreted as taking a portion. However, she took parts off all the pieces, which the author found unacceptable. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and escalate the argument, which might have been disproportionate. The girlfriend was confused and didn't see the issue. Maybe the author should have communicated better before getting angry. However, the action of removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, even if done without malice. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger might be justified if he felt the action was selfish, but his response was to call her names and argue, which could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's misunderstanding might have been a genuine miscommunication. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends. If he overreacted by calling her selfish without considering her intentions, maybe. But if he felt disrespected by the action, maybe not. The key is whether the response was proportional. Since the author got angry and called her names, maybe he's in the wrong for the escalation. Alternatively, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. \n\nHmm. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend took from what was left without considering the author's preferences. However, the author's reaction might be too harsh. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. If the author's anger was disproportionate, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the action was selfish, then not. It's tricky. Maybe the answer is B because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's anger is justified. But maybe the author's response was too harsh. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response could be seen as over the top. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger was justified, then he's not in the wrong. If his reaction was too harsh, then he is. The answer might be A or B. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author's anger is understandable given the action, even if the response could have been better. The main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
