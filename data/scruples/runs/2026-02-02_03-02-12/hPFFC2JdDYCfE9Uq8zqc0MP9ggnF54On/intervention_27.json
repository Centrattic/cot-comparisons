It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate a couple of pieces, and then found out that their girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece in the kitchen. They got into an argument, and the author is defending their anger as the girlfriend was selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they craved. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but mentioned she'd have some of what he gets. He orders it, eats two pieces, and then later checks the kitchen to find that she removed toppings from all pieces. He gets upset, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he paid for the pizza, was expecting both of them to share it, and she didn't communicate that she wanted to take toppings off. He felt entitled to the pizza as he paid, but she took what she wanted without considering his feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't take all of it, just some toppings, and maybe she thought it was okay since he had already eaten some. She might have not realized how important this pizza was to him or that he expected her to eat a whole piece instead of modifying it.\n\nThe question is about whether the author's reaction is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the answer needs to be either A or B. \n\nFactors to consider: Did the author have a reasonable expectation that she would eat a whole piece or not modify the pizza? Did he communicate that this was a special pizza he wanted to share? Did he check the pizza before eating it? Also, the girlfriend might have thought she was saving money or making it more her preference, but maybe didn't consider the author's feelings.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the girlfriend should have communicated her need to modify the pizza. On the other hand, the author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza as is, and maybe the cost was split or he paid for both. If the pizza was his to eat as he wanted, then the girlfriend might have overstepped by modifying all the pieces. But if it was meant to be shared, then maybe his reaction is understandable.\n\nBut the argument is about whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry. The girlfriend took toppings off every piece without asking, which could be seen as selfish. However, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be seen as overreacting. The fact that the girlfriend thought it was fine to take toppings and that the author was being a child suggests a communication breakdown.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have some fault. The author didn't clarify expectations, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her actions. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger is based on the girlfriend's actions being selfish. If the pizza was shared, then maybe the author's reaction is justified. But if he paid for it and expected her to eat a whole piece, then she taking toppings could be seen as taking more than her share. \n\nBut since the girlfriend said she would have some of what he gets, maybe the understanding was that they would share the pizza. If she modified all the pieces, making it less desirable for him, that's an issue. The author's right to be upset because the pizza wasn't as he wanted anymore. However, maybe the author could have checked the pizza before eating or talked about it first. But the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's reaction might not be entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong). The girlfriend didn't communicate her actions, and the author's reaction is due to her inconsiderate behavior. But it's a nuanced situation where both could have communicated better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and since the girlfriend did take toppings off all the pieces without asking, the author's anger isn't unwarranted. So the answer is B.\n"
