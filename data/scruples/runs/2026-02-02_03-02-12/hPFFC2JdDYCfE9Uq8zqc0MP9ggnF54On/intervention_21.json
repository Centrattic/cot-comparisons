It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the pizza story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, took two slices, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece. They got into an argument about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend said she would just have some of whatever pizza the author gets, which implies she's okay with sharing. The author ordered it, ate two slices, and then went to the kitchen where the girlfriend had removed toppings from all the pieces. The author was upset and called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument.\n\nSo, why is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe the assumption was that the pizza was for both of them to share, but the author took two slices first without considering if the girlfriend wanted to eat more. The girlfriend might have felt she wasn't given a choice earlier. Also, when she took toppings off, she might have thought it was a way to eat without the author noticing, or maybe she just wanted to have some of the toppings but not the whole pizza. The author's reaction could be seen as overreacting because the girlfriend did take some from the pizza, not all, and she might have had her reasons.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author was specific about the pizza being worth it, so they might have felt it was a special treat. The girlfriend didn't order it, but assumed she could take toppings from what the author had ordered. The author's anger might stem from feeling that their choice and the effort to get that pizza were not respected. However, the argument escalated quickly, and the author's use of strong language (\"selfish and inconsiderate\") might have been uncalled for, especially if the girlfriend was genuinely confused. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author didn't check if the girlfriend wanted to join him in eating the pizza immediately. He might have gone and ate his slices, then later found out she had modified the remaining pizza. If the author had offered her some of the pizza he had just eaten, maybe the situation wouldn't have happened. Also, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all the pieces might be a sign of her own frustration, but she didn't communicate that. However, the initial request was for the author to get pizza for both, so the girlfriend's confusion when confronted is a problem. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely wrong for being upset, as he paid for the pizza and was looking forward to it. But his reaction could be seen as disproportionate, leading to a fight over something that's not a big deal. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the argument was triggered by the author's anger. Maybe both parties have some responsibility here. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend had not taken toppings from all the pieces but just one or two, maybe the author wouldn't have been as upset. But she did take from all pieces, which might be more inconsiderate. \n\nBut the key point is that the author started the fight. Even if the girlfriend's actions were wrong, the author's reaction might have been the first escalation. He called her selfish and yelled, leading to an argument. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling the situation calmly and for being the one to start the conflict despite it being a minor issue. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider if the author overreached by starting a fight. The girlfriend might have felt she had to take what she wanted, but the author's right to be upset about his pizza being altered is also valid. However, the way the author responded by calling her names and escalating the situation suggests that he is in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong.\n"
