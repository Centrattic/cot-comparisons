It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her something. She said she'd just have some of whatever they got. \n\nHe ordered, ate two slices, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while but didn't mention anything. When he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off, but he thought she took from a couple pieces. However, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The author feels justified in being upset because he thinks it was selfish, but she called him childish.\n\nNow, to assess who's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that by offering her the pizza, she would either take a piece or maybe take toppings from one or two pieces. But she did something different\u2014removing toppings from all the pieces. This might have been a breach of shared resource expectations. \n\nHowever, the author didn't check the pizza before she took the toppings. He went to eat, then noticed later. Also, he might have overreacted by calling her selfish and escalating into a fight. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was to accuse and argue instead of discussing it calmly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take toppings from the pizza without his consent, especially since he had already eaten some. However, removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as taking more than fair share or not considering his enjoyment of the pizza. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified if they had an agreement that the pizza was for both, but his reaction of calling her selfish and starting a fight might have been excessive. The problem here is mutual: the girlfriend didn't communicate her actions, and the author didn't check on the pizza before eating more. \n\nBut considering that the author didn't confirm what she did until he went to the kitchen, maybe he should have checked first. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces without consent is problematic. The argument is about selfishness, so the author's anger stems from feeling his pizza was taken from him. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the middle ground is that both have some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's reaction was a justified response to the girlfriend's inconsiderate act, then he's not in the wrong. However, if his reaction was overly aggressive without clear communication, then maybe he is. \n\nI think the main issue is that the girlfriend took without considering the shared nature of the pizza, which is selfish. The author's anger is a valid response, but maybe he could have handled it better without escalating. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whose actions were more at fault. The girlfriend's action was selfish, but the author's response was also harsh. \n\nBut in AITA posts, often the person who starts the argument is seen as in the wrong if their reaction is disproportionate. Here, the author's anger over the pizza being altered without consent is understandable, but calling someone selfish and starting a fight might be over the top. However, the girlfriend's action was clearly inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was selfish, and the author is justified in being upset, even if the argument could have been handled more calmly. The core issue is her taking without consent, which is a bigger issue than his reaction.\n"
