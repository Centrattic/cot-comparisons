It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted any, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. So he ordered it, ate two pieces, and then noticed when he went to get more that she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got upset, called her selfish, and they argued. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, let's think about communication. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece but just some toppings. The author assumed she meant taking toppings off a couple of pieces, but she actually did it to all. There's a miscommunication here. Maybe the author could have clarified what she meant before ordering. But the girlfriend might have been inconsiderate by not asking for permission or considering his feelings about the pizza he paid for.\n\nWait, the author ordered it himself. Did they agree beforehand that she could modify the pizza? The girlfriend might have thought it was okay since he ordered it for both. But he might feel that since he paid for it, she shouldn't alter it without asking. However, she did eat some of it, so maybe she didn't realize he'd be upset.\n\nAlso, the argument escalated quickly. The author called her names, and she accused him of being a child. Both sides might have overreacted. But the initial issue was the modification of the pizza without consent. Was it selfish? Maybe, but maybe the author should have been more explicit about his expectations. But considering the cost and his craving, he had a reason to be upset.\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. The girlfriend didn't clarify her request properly, and the author didn't confirm her intent after ordering. Both might share some blame, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he reacted strongly and called her selfish, maybe he's overreacting. However, the act of altering the food without consent can be seen as inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the modification was done without his consent, but his reaction might have been harsh. However, the answer options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). Given that both sides have some accountability, but the main issue was her altering the pizza without asking, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
