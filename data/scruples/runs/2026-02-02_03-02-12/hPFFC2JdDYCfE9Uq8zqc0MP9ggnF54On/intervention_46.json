It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific pizza, ate two slices, and then when they went to the kitchen, found that their girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and the argument escalated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear they were starving and wanted pizza from a specific place, which was expensive. They offered the girlfriend some, and she said she would take some of whatever. The author assumed she might take toppings off one or two slices, but instead, she did it to all of them. That's a problem because the author was left with slices that were altered in a way they didn't like.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend didn't take all the toppings\u2014just some. The author feels it's inconsiderate because they wanted the pizza as is. But maybe the girlfriend didn't realize how much the author valued the specific pizza. The author's reaction might be over the top, but they felt their needs were ignored. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was just adjusting the pizza to her taste. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author make it clear they wanted the pizza in its original form? The author ordered it for themselves, but when sharing, it's possible they should have discussed how the pizza would be divided. However, the girlfriend didn't ask to modify the pizza; she just did it, which could be seen as not considering the author's preferences. \n\nThe author's anger seems justified because their order was specific and important to them. The girlfriend's actions altered the meal they were looking forward to, which could be seen as selfish. But maybe the author should have communicated their feelings about not wanting the pizza changed. The argument might have been avoided with better communication from both sides. \n\nIn the end, the author's reaction might be intense, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of how much weight to give to each person's perspective. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response could have been more measured. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend did take toppings off all the slices without asking, the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here.\n"
