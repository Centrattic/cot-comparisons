It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The user ordered pizza from a specific place because it's worth it even though it's expensive. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off the pieces. He thought she took a few pieces' toppings, but she actually took toppings off every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for getting angry. The user thinks he's not wrong. Let me break it down. First, the girlfriend's actions: she took off toppings from all the pizza pieces. That's not just a little, but all of them. The author might feel that since he paid for the pizza and ordered it for both of them, she should have asked or respected his choice. She didn't take a whole piece, but removing toppings from every piece might make the pizza less enjoyable for him. However, was it selfish? Maybe she thought it was okay because he ordered it for her as well, but she didn't like the toppings.\n\nBut did the author overreact? Well, he ordered the pizza and she was part of the household, so maybe she felt entitled to adjust it. The problem is that he didn't check if she wanted anything specific before ordering. He assumed she'd eat the pizza as is. Maybe he should have asked if there were any toppings she wanted or didn't want. On the other hand, he did offer, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. So she didn't specify. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but is getting angry over that proportionate? The author is upset because she altered the pizza without consent, which he paid for. The girlfriend might feel that since he ordered it for her, she has the right to adjust it. However, removing all toppings is a big change. The argument escalated, and he called her selfish, which she felt was unfair. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because his reaction was based on his investment (money and craving) and the unexpected alteration of the food. But maybe he could have handled it better without calling her names. However, the initial action of removing toppings without discussion was perhaps inconsiderate from the girlfriend. So, the author's anger might be justified, but maybe the way he expressed it wasn't. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he ordered the pizza for both, and she modified it without consent, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
