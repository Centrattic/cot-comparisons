It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific expensive pizza they were craving. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would have some of whatever he got. He took two slices, then later went to the kitchen and found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to see if the author's reaction is justified. The key points here are communication and expectations. When the girlfriend said she wanted some of whatever he got, maybe he assumed she would take a slice or two, but she ended up modifying all the pieces. But did he actually say that she could take toppings from the pizza he ordered? He ordered it for himself, but maybe there was an unspoken agreement that they would share. However, she might not have realized that removing toppings from all the pieces would be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have failed to clarify that he wanted to keep the pizza as is. If he was eating two slices, maybe he expected her to take a slice or leave the rest intact. But she took a different approach, which he found inconsiderate. However, she didn't take the whole pizza; she just took parts off each slice. Is that really selfish, or is it a matter of differing expectations?\n\nAlso, the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. Maybe he overreacted because the situation wasn't communicated clearly. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to use the toppings she wanted without taking entire slices. But the author felt his order was being altered without his consent, which could be frustrating. \n\nIt's possible that both parties have valid points. The author might have been a bit controlling over the pizza he ordered, while the girlfriend assumed she could take what she wanted. However, since he explicitly asked if she wanted anything and she said no, but later took action that altered his order, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But getting angry over this and escalating it to a fight could be his fault as well. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The author didn't set clear boundaries about the pizza, and the girlfriend misinterpreted the situation. However, the author's reaction was pretty strong. Maybe he's in the wrong for blowing it out of proportion, but maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was also harsh. Depending on the perspective, either could be right. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A or B, I need to pick one. Since the situation is ambiguous, but the author did get angry over something that wasn't entirely his to control (the pizza was bought for him, but shared), maybe he's not entirely wrong. So I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but I'm not sure.\n"
