It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza with their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted. They offered the girlfriend some, and she said she'd have some of whatever they ordered. The author took two slices, went to watch TV, and when they went to the kitchen later, found the girlfriend had removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces. She seemed confused and accused the author of overreacting.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they ordered the pizza intending to share, but the girlfriend took a significant portion of the toppings, which the author found selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's side: She didn't take all the toppings, just some, and she might have thought that since the author had already taken their share, it was okay to adjust the remaining pizza to her taste. She might not have realized the value the author placed on the pizza or the importance of sharing as they thought it was implied.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ordering the pizza without checking if she wanted to order her own might be a factor. If she wanted a different kind of pizza, she could have said so. However, she did agree to have some of whatever he got. Her actions of taking toppings off all pieces might have been a way to personalize her meal, but it seems inconsiderate to modify what was ordered without asking. \n\nThe author's anger is about feeling disrespected in their choice and the value of the meal. The girlfriend's confusion and accusation that he's overreacting might be valid if she didn't realize the extent of his feelings. However, modifying someone else's meal without consent is generally not respectful, regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, the author's anger is justified because their personal choice and the effort to share were disregarded. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if unintended. They both have some responsibility here, but the main issue is her altering the meal without communication. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for being upset about that.\n"
