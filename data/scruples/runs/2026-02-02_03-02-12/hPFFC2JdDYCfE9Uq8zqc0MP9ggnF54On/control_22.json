My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered expensive pizza he was craving, offered to get their girlfriend something, and she ended up taking toppings off every piece, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author felt that his girlfriend was being selfish by taking the toppings, which he saw as a display of inconsideration. He ordered the pizza specifically because he was starving and had asked her if she wanted anything. She said she'd have some of whatever he got, but later took toppings off all the pieces without his knowledge. The author's frustration seems to stem from the fact that he had already taken two pieces, and she altered the remaining ones in a way he found disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have seen it as her right to eat the pizza as she wanted once it was ordered. She didn't take all the cheese, and she didn't think it was a big deal. She might also feel that since the author had already eaten his share, she was within her rights to adjust the remaining pizza to her taste. Her confusion and the argument escalating could be because she didn't see the action as problematic, hence her response that he was overreacting.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did he have a right to expect the pizza to stay untouched? The girlfriend did say she would have some of whatever he got, but maybe didn't clarify she wanted the same toppings. The author ordered based on his craving, but perhaps should have considered the possibility of needing to adjust the order to meet her preferences. However, once the pizza was there, she had the right to eat it as she pleased, even if she removed toppings from the remaining slices. The author's anger might be valid if the act of removing toppings from every piece was seen as taking for granted that the pizza was his and hers to share. But once he had his share, maybe the rest was hers to handle. The argument could be that the author overreacted by calling her selfish and escalating the situation, leading to the fight.\n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece might be seen as inconsiderate if it made the rest of the pizza inedible for the author. However, she said it's still fine to eat, which complicates that. The author's reaction might be understandable if he felt disrespected, but the way he expressed it (calling her selfish and acting like a child) could have started the fight. So, while both might share some blame, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is his overreaction and the way he initiated the conflict, then he could be at fault. If the girlfriend's actions were the root cause, then maybe not. However, since the question is about the author starting the fight, his initial anger and the way he expressed it might make him at fault. But it's a nuanced situation. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and expectations around shared meals and communication. In many cases, people might side with the author feeling slighted, but his response (calling her selfish and the argument escalating) might be where he went wrong. So, maybe answer A (the author is in the wrong) because he started the fight by overreacting, even if the situation was frustrating. However, others might see the girlfriend's actions as more inconsiderate. It's a toss-up. But the key is whether the author started the fight. If he called her selfish first, then he started it. So perhaps the answer is A.\n"
