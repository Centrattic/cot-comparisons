It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a pizza order. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it, and it's more expensive. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but would have some of what he gets. \n\nHe orders it, eats two pieces, then goes to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, then comes back without eating. When the author asks, she says she took toppings off some pieces. He didn't think she took all the toppings, but when he checks the kitchen, she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece.\n\nHe gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. Let me break it down. First, the author ordered the pizza for himself, but invited his girlfriend to share. She said yes but in a way that might not have been clear. He might have assumed she meant she wanted a whole piece or something, but she actually wanted just the toppings. Then she took from all the pieces, leaving less for him.\n\nBut maybe the problem is communication. He didn't specify that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was, and she didn't clarify her request. She took the toppings off all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. But was he wrong to get angry? He paid for the pizza, but she did say she would have some of what he gets. If she wanted just the toppings, maybe she should have asked for that specifically. But maybe he should have checked if she wanted a piece or just toppings. \n\nAlso, the fact that he ordered without considering that she might want only part of the pizza could be an issue. Maybe he assumed she wanted a full piece, so when she took toppings from all, he felt it was unfair. But she might have thought since he ordered, it's okay to take what she wants. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't specify her needs properly. But maybe he should have communicated better too. However, the girlfriend taking from all the pieces without considering that he wanted to eat them as they were could be seen as selfish. So maybe the author's anger is justified, and he's not in the wrong.\n"
