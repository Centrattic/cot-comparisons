It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza between them and their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza because they were starving. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever they got. The author orders the pizza, eats two pieces, then the girlfriend comes back and the author notices she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The argument ensues because the author feels she was selfish, while the girlfriend thinks the author is overreacting.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nThe author asked the girlfriend if she wanted something and she declined. So the author might have assumed they were okay with the author eating the pizza. However, when the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, the author felt it was inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend didn't take the entire pizza; she just took some toppings. The author might have been expecting her to take a whole piece or just some toppings from one or two pieces, but she took from all. The author is upset because they were looking forward to the pizza, which was expensive and a craving. \n\nIs the author's anger justified? Maybe, depending on the context. They were hungry and ordered the pizza for themselves, thinking the girlfriend was okay with sharing. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces might have been inconsiderate, especially if the author was anticipating eating the rest. However, the girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza, so maybe the author overreacted. \n\nBut the girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions. She said she wanted some toppings, but didn't clarify she would take from all pieces. The author's frustration is about the unexpected modification of the pizza, which they paid for and wanted to eat. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have considered that if the girlfriend wanted some toppings, maybe they could have ordered another pizza or shared. However, the girlfriend didn't do that, and the author didn't check after ordering. \n\nThe question is whether the author's anger was disproportionate. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. The author might not be entirely wrong, but perhaps their reaction was a bit strong. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't unfounded. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while heated, is somewhat justified given the situation. However, the argument could be made that the author could have handled it better without a fight. But the main question is about being in the wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't ask and modified the pizza without consent, the author isn't wrong for being upset.\n"
