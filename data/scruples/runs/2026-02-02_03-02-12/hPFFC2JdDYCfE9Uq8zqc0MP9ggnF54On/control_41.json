It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her something. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he went to the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because he was starving and wanted that specific place. He might have expected her to take a piece or maybe not even eat it since she said she didn't want anything. But she ended up modifying all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. He felt it was selfish because she took the toppings off all the pizza, making it less enjoyable for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he ordered it for himself, she could do what she wanted with her portion. Maybe she didn't realize he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. She might have thought taking a bit of toppings was okay, especially if she didn't take all the cheese off. She also mentioned he already had his pieces, implying that the remaining pizza was fair game for her to modify. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author clearly communicate that he wanted the pizza prepared a certain way? He ordered it for himself, but maybe he should have specified that he wanted the pizza untouched. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have overstepped by altering all the pieces, even if she thought she was only taking a little. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified if he felt his preferences were disregarded. However, getting angry over someone else modifying the remaining pizza, especially if she didn't take all of it, could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend might have thought that since he already had his pieces, it was okay to adjust hers. \n\nAnother angle: the author ordered expensive pizza, which he found worth it. If the modifications ruined his experience, that's a valid concern. But maybe he should have ordered two different pizzas if he wanted hers to be prepared differently. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed she knew not to touch his pizza, while she thought it was just for him and she could adjust hers. The argument could have been avoided if they discussed their expectations beforehand. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate that he didn't want her to alter the pizza, then maybe he shares some responsibility. However, the girlfriend altering all the pieces might have been inconsiderate. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the girlfriend was confused and thought it was okay, maybe the author overreacted. On the other hand, if the modifications affected his enjoyment, he's not entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend didn't take the entire pizza, just some toppings. The author's anger leading to calling her selfish and the argument might have been unnecessary. So maybe the author is partially at fault for overreacting, but the girlfriend did act inconsiderately. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because he escalated the situation, or B (No) because her actions were selfish. \n\nGiven that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering that both sides have valid points, but the author's reaction might have been too harsh, the answer might be A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the answer is B. It's a tough call. I'll go with A because the author might have overreacted, but I'm not certain. Wait, the user's question is from the author's perspective, asking if they are in the wrong. The community might say the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend did something inconsiderate. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
