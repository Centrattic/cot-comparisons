It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering pizza, eating two slices, and then noticing that their girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces. The argument ensued, with the author feeling that the girlfriend was selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was hungry, ordered pizza, and expected to share. The girlfriend said she would take some of whatever pizza he got. The author assumed she would take toppings off one or two slices, but she took from all of them. The author felt wronged because he wanted to eat the pizza as it was, and the girlfriend's actions made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken his slices, the rest was fair game. She might not have considered that the author would want to eat the remaining slices as they were. Her confusion and the author's outburst could have escalated the situation. \n\nBut the key points here are about shared resources and communication. The author didn't check if the girlfriend had taken from the pizza before he ate his slices, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her intention to take toppings off all the pieces. The argument stems from a lack of clear communication. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified if he felt the pizza was for both of them to share as it was. However, getting angry to the point of a big fight over this might be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't realize her actions were problematic. The author's use of harsh language and calling her selfish could be seen as the initial provocation. \n\nIn relationships, how conflicts are handled matters. Even if the author felt wronged, the way the argument unfolded could be considered the author's fault for reacting strongly and perhaps not considering the girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't intend to be inconsiderate, so the author's reaction might have been disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be at fault for overreacting and not handling the situation calmly. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate. But given the context of how the argument escalated, the author's reaction could be seen as the wrong part.\n"
