It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces, which the author found inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific place they were craving. The girlfriend initially said she wanted some of whatever he ordered. He got the pizza, ate two pieces, and assumed she might take toppings from a couple of slices. Instead, she took toppings and cheese off every single piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. But when he ordered, he didn't specify that he wanted the pizza left intact. She thought she could modify the pizza as she liked, which she did by removing toppings from all slices. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about the effort and expense of the pizza, and the selfish act of ruining the pizza for him. But from her side, she might have thought she was being considerate by leaving some toppings for herself. The problem is that they didn't communicate properly. The author didn't clarify his expectations, and she didn't consider that modifying all the pizza would affect his experience.\n\nHowever, calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion might be the author's fault. The author didn't set boundaries beforehand. It's possible that she didn't realize the impact of her actions. Since the pizza was important to him, he should have made that clear when ordering. On the other hand, her action of taking all the toppings could be seen as inconsiderate, especially after he had already eaten some.\n\nBut the main issue here is the lack of communication. Both parties might have misunderstandings. The author's anger over the pizza could be justified if he expected her to leave some intact, but he didn't specify. However, her response was to take toppings off all pieces, which might be seen as selfish. However, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate without understanding her perspective could be hasty. \n\nIn conclusion, while both might have contributed to the conflict, the author's lack of clear communication about his expectations and his strong reaction might place some responsibility on him. However, her actions could also be seen as inconsiderate. But since he didn't set boundaries, it's a bit of a mutual misunderstanding. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he didn't clarify his needs and reacted strongly, maybe he's partially at fault. So the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong). But some might argue B. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B, because she took all the toppings which is inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up, but in terms of who initiated the conflict, the author's anger might be a response to her action. However, he didn't communicate his needs first. I think the answer is A.\n"
