It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was really craving pizza and ordered it from an expensive place. The girlfriend said she would have some of whatever he got. He assumed she would take toppings from one or two pieces, but she actually took toppings and chunks of cheese off every piece. Then he got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and they had a big argument.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the misunderstanding. The author thought she would take a bit, but she removed a lot from all the pizza. The girlfriend says she didn't take all the cheese, and it's still eatable. But the author feels wronged because he didn't get the pizza he wanted.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might have been inconsiderate by not checking if the girlfriend wanted to order her own pizza, maybe expecting her to want a different type. But he did ask if she wanted anything, and she said \"no, just have some of whatever I get.\" So he thought it was okay to order it. \n\nThen, the girlfriend took toppings from all pieces, which the author might see as spoiling his pizza. But she thought it was okay since he had two pieces already. Was it reasonable for him to get angry? Maybe he overreacted. The girlfriend might not have realized how important the pizza was to him, especially since it was a specific place and expensive. But she also thought she was being helpful by taking a little. \n\nThe argument escalated because he called her names and she felt he was acting childish. The key here is communication. The author could have specified that he wanted the pizza as is, maybe even ordered separate ones if needed. The girlfriend might not have considered that he would mind the way she modified the pizza. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did start the argument by getting angry and making accusations. His reaction might have been disproportionate, even if his feelings were hurt. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but maybe not selfish. The author didn't set clear boundaries, leading to the misunderstanding. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not communicating his needs better. But the girlfriend also didn't think about his preferences when she took toppings off all the pieces. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often a mix of both parties. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he was the one who started the fight with anger and called her names, maybe he's at fault for the escalation. But if the act of her modifying the pizza was the real issue, then maybe not. \n\nI think the main problem is the lack of communication. The author didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza untouched, and the girlfriend didn't realize how much he wanted it as it was. The anger might be justified if he really wanted to enjoy the pizza as ordered, but the way he reacted (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) might be the wrong part. So the answer could be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, since she did take from all pieces without considering his preference, maybe it's B. \n\nWait, the user's options are A for yes (author in wrong), B for no. So if the author's anger was reasonable, then B. If he overreacted, then A. The girlfriend's action was definitely inconsiderate, but maybe the author is in the wrong for blowing it out of proportion. The question is whether his anger was in proportion. Since it's just pizza, maybe he did overreact. But if the specific pizza was a big deal to him, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer here is A because the author's reaction was harsh and he started the conflict, even if the girlfriend was being inconsiderate. The question is about being in the wrong, and the way he responded (using strong language, escalating the argument) might make him the one to blame. So I'll go with A.\n"
