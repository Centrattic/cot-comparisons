It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a fight over pizza. The writer ordered pizza from a specific place, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no but wanted some of whatever he got. He took two slices, then later went to the kitchen and found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer ordered the pizza because he was craving it and thought it was worth the price. He offered her to have some, which she initially said no to but then ended up taking toppings from all the pieces. The problem is that she didn't just take a few toppings from one or two slices but every piece. The writer felt that was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to the argument.\n\nNow, to determine if the writer is in the wrong. Let's consider both perspectives. From the writer's point of view, he ordered the pizza for himself, expecting her to take maybe some toppings from a couple of slices. But when she took from every single piece, he felt it was excessive and not fair. He might think that she didn't communicate her needs better\u2014like if she wanted some toppings, she should have asked or ordered her own. But he also didn't specify that she couldn't take from the pizza after he ordered. \n\nOn her side, she said she would have some of whatever he got, so maybe she thought taking toppings off multiple pieces was acceptable. However, taking from every piece might have crossed a line. She might not have realized the extent of her actions affecting his enjoyment. But he also didn't check on the pizza until later, so maybe he could have addressed it sooner.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, which I can see. The argument escalated because of the writer's reaction. But maybe the writer could have handled it differently. However, the main issue is whether he was in the wrong for getting angry. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about expectations and communication. The writer might have expected her to take only a little, not to deconstruct all the pizza. She might have thought it was okay. But the problem is her actions not aligning with his expectations. So, is he wrong for being upset? Possibly not. But was he wrong to call her selfish and escalate the argument? Maybe. But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. \n\nI think the key here is that both sides have some responsibility. The writer didn't specify that she couldn't take from the pizza, and she might have misjudged how much she took. However, the writer's reaction of calling her selfish and bringing up other issues might have been over the top. But the initial action of her taking all the toppings could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if both sides have some faults, it's a shared responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, and the options are A for yes (author wrong) or B for no (not wrong). \n\nConsidering that the author's main issue was the girlfriend's actions and his reaction, but he also didn't set clear boundaries beforehand. However, the girlfriend did take from all the slices without considering his preference. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the main fault lies with her. So answer B.\n"
