It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a place they wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but would have some of whatever they get. He orders it, eats two pieces, then when he goes to the kitchen, he finds she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear they were starving and wanted that pizza. They asked her if she wanted to have some of what they ordered, which she said no. So maybe he thought she wasn't going to take any. But she ended up taking toppings off every piece, which he found inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, maybe she thought it was okay to take the toppings because he had already eaten some. The girlfriend might not have realized that taking the toppings from all pieces would make the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. However, she did say she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. He thought that meant taking a bit off one or two pieces, not all of them. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author ordered the pizza, assuming she didn't want any because she said no when asked. Then she took toppings off all pieces without his knowledge. But maybe she thought it was okay since he had already eaten, or perhaps she didn't consider that he might be upset. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? He was angry over something that's just pizza, but the girlfriend's actions might have been selfish. However, maybe the author overreacted because it's not a huge issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't follow through with the initial agreement and acted inconsiderately. \n\nBut the author called her a child and it led to a big argument. The girlfriend might have been confused because she thought she was saving money by taking toppings instead of ordering her own pizza. However, the way she took everything from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he had the right to expect that the pizza he ordered wouldn't be ruined. But maybe they both have some fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend didn't communicate her actions and took the toppings in a way that affected the pizza the author had already paid for and wanted to eat. The author's anger, while maybe intense, was in response to a violation of their agreement. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
