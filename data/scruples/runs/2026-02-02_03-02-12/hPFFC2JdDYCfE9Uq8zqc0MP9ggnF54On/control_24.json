It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the argument over the pizza is in the wrong. The situation involves the author ordering a specific, more expensive pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever they got. The author orders it, eats two pieces, then goes to the kitchen where the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that the girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions properly. They ordered the pizza intending to share, but the girlfriend took the toppings off all pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought the author had already taken their share and that the remaining pizza was fair game for her to modify as she liked. She might not have realized that the author valued the pizza highly and wanted to enjoy it as it was.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that sharing the pizza meant both would eat it as is, while the girlfriend took it as the author having already claimed their portion, leaving the rest for her to handle. The author's anger stems from feeling that the girlfriend was selfish, while the girlfriend thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole piece.\n\nIt's possible that the author overreacted by calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying every single piece might also be seen as inconsiderate if she knew the author was particular about the pizza. The root of the problem might be a lack of clear communication. The author didn't specify their preferences, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her intentions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger might be disproportionate if the pizza was just a minor issue, but the girlfriend's actions could also be seen as not respecting the shared nature of the meal. However, since the author was the one who escalated the situation by calling the girlfriend names and leading to an argument, they might be more at fault for not managing their expectations and reacting aggressively. Alternatively, the girlfriend might be at fault for not considering the author's preferences. But given the information, the author's reaction seems more intense, so maybe they are in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: if the author had asked the girlfriend first before modifying the pizza, maybe the argument wouldn't have happened. The girlfriend didn't ask for permission, so maybe she's partially at fault. But the author didn't communicate their preferences. It's a two-way issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions were unexpected, but the author's response was to call her selfish and escalate, perhaps the author is in the wrong for overreacting. So answer A for yes.\n"
