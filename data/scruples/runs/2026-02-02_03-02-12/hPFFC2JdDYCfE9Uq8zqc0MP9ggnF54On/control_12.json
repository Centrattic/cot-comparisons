It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered their favorite pizza, which was expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two slices, and went to watch TV. When he noticed she hadn't eaten, he went to check and found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author was excited about the pizza, maybe even a bit starved. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but later took from his order. The key point is that she didn't take just a little from a couple slices but from all of them. The author might feel that she didn't honor her initial refusal and instead took what she wanted without considering his feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend might think that since it's his pizza, she's allowed to take some if he's eating it too. She might not see the issue because she didn't take all the cheese, just some, and thought it was fair since he ordered it for both of them.\n\nThe author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish. The girlfriend thought he was overreacting. The question is whether the author was wrong. It's a judgment call. The girlfriend didn't ask for the pizza, but once it was there, maybe she assumed it was shared. However, the author paid for it and might have expected it to be his own. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but is the author's anger justified?\n\nFactors to consider: Did the author communicate clearly? He asked her if she wanted something, and she said no. Then he ordered. Maybe he should have specified that it was his own order, not for both. But he did offer, and she declined. The girlfriend's taking the toppings without his knowledge could be seen as sneaky. However, if the pizza was in the kitchen and he was eating in the living room, maybe she thought it was okay to take from it. The argument escalated because of misunderstandings. The author's anger might be a bit over the top, but the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe both could have been more considerate. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend took from his food without permission and was defensive. The author's anger might have been excessive, but the initial act of taking without asking was inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, the author did order the pizza, and if it was clear it was for him, then the girlfriend shouldn't have taken from it. If it was intended to be a shared meal, then the girlfriend's actions were okay. The initial offer to her might have implied that it's his to eat, and she's free to take if she wants. But she said no, so maybe she didn't expect to take it later. The author's reaction was intense, but the girlfriend's actions were sneaky. \n\nIn the end, maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he started the fight by getting angry over the girlfriend's actions, which she didn't think were wrong, he might be partly at fault for overreacting. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. But given that the girlfriend didn't ask and took without considering his feelings, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, his reaction was harsh, so perhaps he's partially at fault. But the options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Given the details, the answer might be B because the author's anger was a reaction to the girlfriend's inconsiderate act, but the argument was his fault for escalating it. Alternatively, he's not in the wrong because the girlfriend was inconsiderate. It's tricky. I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were the root cause, but he did escalate it. But maybe the answer is A because he started the fight over something minor. Hmm.\n"
