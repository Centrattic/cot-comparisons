It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, then found out his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the remaining pieces in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The author ordered the pizza, but he did offer his girlfriend something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two slices and left the rest. Then she took toppings off all the remaining slices. The key points are about sharing and expectations. \n\nThe author's perspective: He might feel that since he paid for the pizza, she shouldn't have altered the remaining slices without asking. He's upset because she didn't leave the pizza as it was, even though she didn't take all of it. He might feel she was being selfish by taking the toppings, making the pizza less enjoyable for him when he wanted to eat more.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might think that since he already had his two slices, the rest was his to do with as he wanted. She took some toppings off for her own preference, not realizing it would bother him. She might not see it as selfish because she didn't take the whole pizza, just modified it to her taste.\n\nNow, considering shared expenses: If they split the cost, maybe she had a right to use the remaining pizza. But the author ordered it, so maybe he expected to control the pizza he bought. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of sharing, but personal preferences can vary. She might have a right to adjust the food she's eating for her taste. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't check if she wanted to eat when he ordered, just assumed she'd get her own. Then, when she modified the pizza, he didn't check first. Maybe the author overreacted because he expected her to leave the pizza as is, but she had her own way of eating it. Alternatively, she should have asked if she wanted to take toppings off.\n\nIn terms of selfishness, she took what she wanted but didn't consider his preferences. However, he might have been selfish by eating two slices first without considering she might want more. The argument escalated because of lack of communication and different expectations. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the pizza was a shared order, then she modifying the remaining pieces could be seen as reasonable. But if it was his order, maybe he should have specified. The author's anger might be disproportionate, but her actions could also be seen as inconsiderate. The problem is more about communication than who is technically right. \n\nSince the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the act of taking toppings off all the pizza without considering his future use could be seen as selfish, even if she didn't take the whole pizza. The author's reaction is about the selfishness and inconsideration, which others might see as valid. So, B is the answer.\n"
