It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about pizza. The author ordered pizza they really wanted, and their girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and then later found out she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author probably felt that since they asked her if she wanted anything, and she said no, he assumed she was okay with the pizza as it was. He ordered it himself, maybe expecting her to just have a piece or two. But when he found out she took toppings off every piece, that might have felt like she ruined his meal without considering his preferences or effort to get the pizza.\n\nThe girlfriend's side is that she didn't want a whole piece, just some of the toppings. Maybe she thought it was more efficient to take what she wanted from the existing pizza rather than making a separate order. She might have seen it as saving money or avoiding extra effort. But the problem here is that she did this without asking, and the author found it inconsiderate.\n\nNow, to judge if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess if his reaction was disproportionate. The key points are communication and expectations. Did the author clearly state that he wanted the pizza as is, or was it implied? He did ask if she wanted anything, she said no, so maybe he thought she wouldn't alter it. She, on the other hand, might have thought that since he ordered it for her, she could adjust it to her taste. But taking toppings off every piece is a big change. It's not just taking a few pieces; it's modifying all of them, which might affect his ability to enjoy the pizza as he wanted.\n\nThe author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. However, the core issue was her modifying the food without his consent. If she had asked first, maybe that wouldn't have been a problem. But she didn't, leading to his frustration. The argument might have been avoidable with better communication, but the act of altering the pizza without asking is where the issue lies.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's anger stems from her actions affecting his meal without discussion. While the argument escalated, the initial reaction might be justified as a matter of personal boundaries and respect for preferences. However, the way he called her names and blamed her could have been handled better. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just the handling of the argument.\n\nIn conclusion, the main fault might lie with the girlfriend for not respecting his order without communication. But the author's response also contributed to the conflict. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that he was defending his own preferences, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. The key factor is the lack of communication from both sides, but the action of altering the pizza without consent is on her part.\n"
