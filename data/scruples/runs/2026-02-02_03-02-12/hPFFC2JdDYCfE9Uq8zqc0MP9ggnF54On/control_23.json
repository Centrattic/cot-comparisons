It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering a specific, expensive pizza they were craving, and their girlfriend taking toppings off every piece in the kitchen. The author feels the girlfriend was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author was clear they were starving and had asked if the girlfriend wanted anything. The girlfriend said she'd have some of the pizza the author got. The author ordered and ate their two pieces, assuming the rest would be shared. The girlfriend went into the kitchen, and when the author went to check, he found all the toppings removed. The girlfriend was confused why the author was angry, stating she didn't take all the cheese and that the author had their pieces.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have expected the pizza to be a shared meal, but didn't clarify that. The girlfriend thought the author had their pieces and didn't consider the others. However, the author did ask if she wanted anything, so maybe the expectation was that they would both enjoy the pizza together. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece was inconsiderate because it ruined the pizza for others, even if she didn't take all the cheese. The author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which escalated the situation. The girlfriend felt the author was overreacting.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The author's frustration comes from the girlfriend's actions preventing others from enjoying the pizza. However, the author didn't set clearer boundaries about sharing the pizza. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of taking toppings off all pieces would affect others. The author's anger was justified because it's a shared resource, but calling someone selfish and escalating to a fight could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's confusion and the author's reaction both have elements of miscommunication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it without the fight. However, the girlfriend's action was indeed inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't explicitly state that the pizza was for both, but the girlfriend didn't clarify her needs either. The author's reaction was intense, but the situation involved a shared expense and meal. The girlfriend's action was selfish, so the author's anger isn't unwarranted. However, the way it was handled led to a fight. The answer is likely B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author could have approached it differently. But the main question is if the author is wrong. Since the girlfriend's action was selfish, the author's anger isn't unwarranted. So the answer is B.\n"
