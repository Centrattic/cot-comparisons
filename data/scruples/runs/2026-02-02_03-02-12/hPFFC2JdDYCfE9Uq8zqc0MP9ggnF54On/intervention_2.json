It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after a fight over pizza.\n\nThe situation is that the author ordered their favorite pizza, which is a bit expensive. They grabbed two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time, and when the author checked, she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective: he ordered the pizza because he was craving it, and he assumed she would take toppings from one or two pieces if she wanted some. But when he found out she took from every piece, he felt it was inconsiderate. The girlfriend's perspective: she didn't take a whole piece, just some toppings, and thought it was fine because he already had his own pieces. She might have felt that since he ordered it, he could have the whole thing, so she didn't need to eat the full slices. \n\nNow, considering communication. The author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the pizza intact for himself, maybe assuming she would take only a small part. The girlfriend might not have realized that removing toppings from all pieces would ruin the experience for him. But did he have a right to be angry? It's about unspoken expectations versus actual behavior. The fight started because of a misunderstanding. The author might be inconsiderate by not discussing the order and assuming she would take only a little. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but maybe not on purpose if she didn't know it would bother him. \n\nIs the author wrong for getting angry? Possibly, because he didn't communicate his needs clearly. However, the girlfriend's action could be seen as selfish if she knew he wanted the pizza as is. But she said she was confused, so maybe she didn't. The argument escalated without understanding each other's points. \n\nSo, both could have handled it better. The author didn't clarify his expectations, and the girlfriend didn't consider that removing toppings might affect his enjoyment. But the question is whether the author is wrong. Maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his reaction could be seen as over the top. However, since the girlfriend's action was indeed inconsiderate, even if unintentional, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
