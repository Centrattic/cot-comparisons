It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry over their girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces. The situation is about a disagreement over pizza, which might seem trivial, but the user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a specific pizza they wanted, asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no. Then the author took two slices. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, came back, and after being asked why she didn't eat, she explained she took toppings off one or two pieces. But when the author went to the kitchen, they found all the pieces had toppings and cheese removed. The girlfriend was confused by the author's anger, called the author childish, and they argued more.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that \"having some of whatever pizza\" meant she would take a piece or two, maybe even share. The girlfriend interpreted it as taking toppings off a few pieces. The author might have expected that ordering pizza for both would mean sharing, but the girlfriend didn't see it that way. The author ordered an expensive pizza, so maybe they were more attached to the food being intact. The girlfriend took all the toppings, which could be seen as taking more than agreed, but she didn't eat any, just modified the remaining slices. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling that the girlfriend was selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend's response was defensive, leading to an argument. The question is whether the author overreacted. \n\nFrom a perspective of ownership, if the author paid for the pizza as a shared expense, then modifying it without consent could be an issue. However, if the girlfriend thought she could do that because she didn't want a whole piece, maybe she miscommunicated. The author might be in the right for being upset about the modification, but the reaction (calling her selfish and the argument escalating) might be disproportionate. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful, but the author's anger might also be over a minor issue. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't clarify if the girlfriend wanted any specific modifications when they ordered, and the girlfriend didn't ask for permission to alter the pizza. Both parties might have contributed to the misunderstanding. However, the author's frustration over something that seems trivial could be seen as overreacting, hence possibly being in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate without prior discussion, the author might have a point. \n\nConsidering that the pizza was a shared purchase, the girlfriend altering it without consent might be inconsiderate. But the way the author reacted by calling her selfish and escalating to an argument might be the real issue. The answer could hinge on whether the action (modifying the pizza) was inconsiderate versus the reaction being too harsh. If the argument was about the modification itself, the author might have a point, but if it's about the reaction being too intense, then maybe the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the key is that the author ordered the pizza as a shared expense, expecting it to be shared. The girlfriend altered the pizza without asking, which could be inconsiderate. However, the author's reaction might be too harsh for the situation. The girlfriend's response was also dismissive, but the initial act of modifying the shared meal without communication is a problem. The author could have addressed it calmly instead of escalating. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but their reaction might be part of the issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend didn't eat the pizza and just wanted toppings, maybe she could have asked to have a different type next time instead of modifying the existing one. The author might be in the right to be upset, but the argument's escalation is where they might be in the wrong. So perhaps the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong for being upset but in the wrong for the argument's escalation. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. \n\nIn the context of the question, the author's main action is starting a fight. So if the fight was overreacting, then the author is in the wrong. If the fight was a reasonable response to the inconsiderate act, then not. The answer is likely B (No), because the author's anger stems from a reasonable expectation of shared pizza without modification, but their reaction might be too harsh. However, the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut given the options, the answer is likely B (No) because the author's frustration is understandable given the situation, but maybe there's a nuance. Alternatively, the answer could be A if the author is seen as overreacting. However, considering the girlfriend took toppings off all the pizza, which the author paid for, the author might have a valid reason to be upset. So the answer is B (No).\n"
