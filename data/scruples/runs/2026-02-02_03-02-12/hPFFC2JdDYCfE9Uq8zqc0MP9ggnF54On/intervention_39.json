It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author ordered an expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time. When he went to get more, he found she had removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The author feels justified, but the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the situation. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author ordered the pizza for himself but asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then, he ate two pieces, and when she didn't eat, she later took toppings off all the pieces. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from her altering the pizza in a way he didn't expect. But maybe he didn't consider that she might want to avoid leftovers or eat it later. However, removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as affecting his meal. On the other hand, the author didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza untouched for himself. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been over the top. He escalated the situation by calling her names. Maybe they should have communicated better. The argument isn't about the pizza itself but about expectations and how they handled the situation.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, both have some responsibility. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the action did affect his meal, but his reaction could be seen as disproportionate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on perspective. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it differently. \n\nBut based on the details, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. However, his response (calling her selfish, leading to an argument) might have been the wrong approach. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but perhaps both share some blame. The options are A or B, so the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the initial frustration is justified, even if the reaction could be better. But according to the user's view, they think he's not wrong.\n"
