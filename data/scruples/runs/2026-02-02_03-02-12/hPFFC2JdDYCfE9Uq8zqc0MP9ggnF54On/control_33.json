It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, came back, and when he asked why she didn't eat, she said she took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she said he was acting like a child. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the girlfriend agreed to have some of whatever he ordered. But when he ordered, she didn't take a whole piece but modified the remaining pizza. The key point is whether her action was acceptable. Did she take his food without permission? He paid for the pizza, right? So maybe he thought it was his, but she might have thought they were sharing.\n\nBut wait, he asked if she wanted anything and she said no, just some of his pizza. So maybe she had the impression that leftovers were hers to take. However, taking toppings off every single piece seems excessive. But she didn't take the whole pizza, just parts. He might have felt disrespected, but is getting angry over that justified?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have assumed that since he had already taken two pieces, she could adjust the remaining pizza as she liked. She didn't take all the cheese, just some. But taking toppings off every piece could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he was eating the same pizza. Maybe she didn't consider that he would want to eat the remaining pieces as they were.\n\nThe argument escalated when he called her selfish, and she acted defensively. The question is whether he overreacted. If he paid for the pizza and they were sharing, maybe she should have discussed taking parts of it. But if they're in a relationship, maybe they assume shared resources. However, modifying the food someone else ordered without discussing could be a problem.\n\nI think the main issue is communication. He might have expected that she would take a piece or just leave it as is. Her taking toppings off every piece without discussing it could be inconsiderate. But he also didn't consider that maybe she thought he didn't mind. Both might have miscommunication here. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion might be seen as his fault. But maybe he's right in feeling that her action was selfish. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nBut looking at the details: he ordered the pizza for himself, but she was part of the household. Maybe she thought it was shared food. Still, modifying it without discussion could be an issue. His anger might be justified if he felt disrespected. However, the way he reacted (calling her names) might have been wrong. Alternatively, she didn't take the whole pizza, just parts. It's tricky. I think the answer could go either way, but the key points are about expectations and communication. If he paid for it and she took from it without permission, maybe she's in the wrong. But if they share expenses, maybe she's justified. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's anger might be reasonable, but the way he reacted could be excessive. However, based on the story, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her action was inconsiderate, and his reaction, while heated, was a response to that.\n"
