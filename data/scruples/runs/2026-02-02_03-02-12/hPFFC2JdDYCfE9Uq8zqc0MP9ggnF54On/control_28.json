It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So, the situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out their girlfriend had removed toppings and cheese from all the remaining pieces. They got into an argument about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author thought their girlfriend was being selfish by taking toppings off every piece, even though they had already eaten two. The girlfriend, on the other hand, said she just wanted some of the toppings and didn't take all the cheese, so the pizza was still edible. She also mentioned the author had already had their share.\n\nThe author called their girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which led to a big argument. The girlfriend responded by calling the author childish. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI should consider intentions. The author ordered pizza, paid for it, and ate two pieces. They might have expected that the rest would remain untouched for them. However, the girlfriend did take some toppings off, but not all. Maybe she didn't realize how much it would bother the author. The author's reaction seems a bit over the top, but perhaps not entirely unwarranted. The girlfriend's action might be seen as inconsiderate if she didn't ask or discuss it first. However, the author's response of calling her selfish and escalating to a fight could be the issue here.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't check in again after the initial offer to share. The girlfriend didn't ask if it was okay to remove toppings. Both might have made assumptions. But the author's anger and using harsh language might be the problem. The girlfriend removing toppings isn't necessarily a major issue, but the author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate. The key is whether the author's anger was justified. Since the pizza was expensive and they had a craving, maybe the author was justified in feeling upset. However, the argument escalated because of the way they reacted. So maybe the author is not entirely at fault, but perhaps both have some responsibility. However, the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate but not malicious, and the author overreacted, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's actions were truly selfish, then not. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend did take from the pizza without consideration, but the author's reaction might have been harsh. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is on the initial action. The author ordered pizza for themselves and offered sharing, but the girlfriend's action of removing toppings without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's anger might be justified, but their response (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) could be seen as the problem. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the action was not so bad, then the author is the asshole. It's tricky. I think the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend did take from the pizza without permission, even if it was just toppings. The author has a right to be upset if they paid for it and expected it to remain as ordered. However, the way they reacted is questionable. But in AITA, the question is if they're the asshole. The answer might be B because the author isn't entirely at fault. Alternatively, maybe A if the reaction was too harsh. Hmm. I need to decide based on the scenario. I think the answer is B because the author's anger is understandable given the circumstances, even if their response was harsh. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, leading to the argument. So the author isn't the asshole.\n"
