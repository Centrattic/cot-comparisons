It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The guy ordered pizza from a specific place because he really wanted it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. Then he took two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he checked the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the expectations here. The man ordered the pizza for himself, thinking she would take a piece or maybe some toppings. But she ended up modifying all the pieces, which made him angry. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. \n\nThe girl said she didn't want to take a whole piece, just some toppings. The guy thought she might take from one or two pieces, but she took from all of them. Maybe he felt that by taking from all pieces, she made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. But she didn't eat any of it, just took toppings off. The question is whether that action was selfish enough to warrant a big argument.\n\nOn one hand, the girl might have thought it was okay to take some toppings without asking, especially since she didn't take the whole pizza. She might have considered that since he ordered it for both of them, he wouldn't mind her using some of the toppings. On the other hand, the man might feel that she didn't respect his choice of pizza, especially since it was a specific place he wanted. He might have expected her to ask or to take a piece instead of altering all the toppings.\n\nCommunication seems to be a big factor here. The girl didn't clarify her action when she said she wanted toppings, and the man didn't check what she meant exactly. So when he found out, he was upset because his expectation of sharing a pizza was not met. However, the girl might not have intended to be inconsiderate. \n\nBut then, is getting angry over someone taking toppings from pizza they were sharing selfish? The man called her selfish, but maybe he should have considered that she had a different approach to sharing. Alternatively, maybe he should have ordered enough pizza for both without assuming she'd take a piece. \n\nAnother angle: if the pizza was his choice and he paid for it, maybe she shouldn't have altered it without asking. But if they were sharing, she might feel entitled to take some toppings. The problem is that the modification affected his enjoyment of the pizza. \n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his expectations clearly, maybe he's partly at fault. But if she took toppings without permission, that's inconsiderate. The argument escalated because of the miscommunication. The girl might not have realized the impact of her actions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girl's action was perhaps inconsiderate, but the man's reaction might have been over the top. However, the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. If he had a valid reason to be upset because she altered the pizza without permission, then he's not wrong. But if he overreacted, then maybe he is. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the key is whether the girl acted selfishly. The man felt she did, but she thought it was fine. Since she didn't ask and modified all the pizza, maybe she was inconsiderate. So the man isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. Since the fight was over her actions, maybe he's not entirely wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she was inconsiderate, even if the argument could have been handled better.\n"
