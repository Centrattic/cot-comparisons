She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is a bit more expensive but worth it to them. They told their girlfriend they were going to order it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever the author gets. So the author orders the pizza, eats two pieces, and then the girlfriend comes back after being in the kitchen a while. The author notices she hasn't eaten and asks why, and she explains she took toppings and cheese off all the pieces, not just one or two. The author gets upset, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nHmm. The main issue here seems to be about differing expectations and communication. The author assumed the girlfriend would take toppings off a couple of pieces, but she ended up doing it to all of them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author already had two pieces, she could take what she wanted from the remaining pizza. She might not have realized how much the author valued having the pizza as it was, especially since they ordered it specifically. \n\nThe author's frustration could stem from seeing their ordered food altered in a way that made it less enjoyable. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have been inconsiderate without communication. But was the author's reaction justified? Yelling and calling someone selfish and inconsiderate can be seen as harsh, especially if the girlfriend didn't realize the full extent of what she did. However, the author might feel that the girlfriend didn't respect their preference for the pizza they paid for. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already eaten their share, she could do with the leftovers as she pleased. The argument could have been avoided if the author had clarified their preference beforehand. But since the situation escalated, perhaps the author overreacted by calling her names and making it personal. The girlfriend's confusion suggests that she didn't intend harm, so the author's anger might have been disproportionate to the actual issue. \n\nBut then again, if the author specifically ordered that pizza for the toppings, having them all removed could be frustrating. It's a matter of perspective. The key here is whether the author's anger was justified. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response of labeling her as selfish and starting an argument might have been more intense than needed. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not communicating clearly and overreacting, while the girlfriend is at fault for not considering how her actions affected the author. But the question is solely about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that both have some responsibility. However, the question asks if the author is in the wrong. If the author called their partner names and escalated the situation without trying to calmly discuss it, that could be their fault. But if the girlfriend's actions were genuinely inconsiderate without communication, then maybe the author's anger is somewhat justified. \n\nI think the answer might hinge on whether the author had the right to expect the pizza to remain untouched after ordering it for both. Since the girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza, the author might have assumed that sharing meant the pizza would be eaten as is. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as altering the meal that the author paid for, which is inconsiderate. But the author's reaction might be the bigger issue here. Instead of getting angry, they could have discussed it calmly. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just about handling it better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend is wrong for removing toppings without discussion, and the author is not in the wrong for being upset. But the argument was initiated by the author, so perhaps they are at fault for starting the fight. However, the girlfriend's actions were the catalyst. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. I think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's frustration is understandable. However, the way the author reacted might be more intense than necessary. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their reaction was the best. Since the girlfriend did something that the author found inconsiderate, the author isn't entirely at fault. So I think the answer is B.\n"
