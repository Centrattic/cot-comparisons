It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her some. She said she wanted some but not a whole piece. The author then ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and when they checked the kitchen, found that the girlfriend had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author had a specific craving and paid for a more expensive pizza. They offered the GF some, and she said she wanted some but not a whole piece. The author might have expected that she would take a small portion or maybe a piece with toppings removed a bit. However, the GF removed toppings and cheese from every single piece, leaving the pizza inedible for the author's preference. The author feels this is selfish because the pizza was their choice and they were expecting to eat it as is.\n\nOn the other hand, the GF might have thought that since the author had already taken two pieces, it was okay for her to use the remaining pizza as she wanted. She might not have realized that the author valued the toppings and cheese so much that removing them would make the pizza unappealing. She could have considered that the author might not like the pizza without those elements, but maybe she didn't think about it that way.\n\nNow, considering communication. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza the way it was, with all toppings and cheese. They just ordered it and assumed she would take a piece or part of it. The GF might have thought that since the author had already eaten, she could adjust the remaining pizza as she pleased. The misunderstanding here is significant. The author didn't set clear expectations about how the pizza should be handled, and the GF didn't ask for clarification.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did order the pizza for themselves and offered it, but they didn't make their preferences explicit. However, when the GF altered the pizza in a way that rendered it unpalatable to the author, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion\u2014might be the issue here. The GF removed toppings from every piece, which is a lot, but if she had just taken a small part, it might not have been a problem. The author's anger stems from the pizza not being as they wanted, but maybe they should have communicated their needs better.\n\nOn the other hand, the GF's actions could be seen as respectful if she thought the author had already taken their share, but removing all toppings from every piece is extreme. The author's frustration is understandable if they were craving that specific pizza with all toppings. The GF's confusion and not considering the author's preferences might contribute to the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties may have some. The author didn't clearly state their preferences about the pizza's toppings, and the GF didn't consider that the author might prefer the pizza untouched. However, the GF's action of altering every piece could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the pizza was the author's choice. The author's anger is a reaction to having their preferences disregarded, but the way they expressed it (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) might be where they're in the wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the GF's actions were indeed selfish, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the GF thought she was within her rights to use the remaining pizza as she saw fit, then the author's reaction is the problem. The key is whether the GF's actions were inconsiderate. Removing all toppings from every piece is a significant alteration, which the author valued. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but their reaction might have been too harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The GF's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the way the argument escalated might be a point, but the core issue is the GF's handling of the pizza. The author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted given the situation.\n"
