It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they craved. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she would have some of whatever they get. Then, after the author took two pieces, the girlfriend took toppings off all the pizza pieces in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective: they were craving pizza, paid for it, and expected to eat it as is. The girlfriend's actions of taking toppings off all the pieces might have been unexpected and felt like a violation of their expectations. The author might feel that the girlfriend didn't ask before modifying the pizza, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, maybe she thought sharing the pizza was okay since the author had already taken two pieces. She might not have realized how important this pizza was to the author. She could have felt that since there was leftover pizza, she could adjust it to her taste without considering the author's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza left as is, and the girlfriend didn't ask for permission before altering it. However, the girlfriend might have acted out of self-interest without considering the author's feelings. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting to a minor issue, but if the pizza was a big deal to them, their frustration is understandable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They ordered the pizza and expected to have it as it was. The girlfriend took it upon herself to modify it without consent. That seems inconsiderate. However, the author could have asked the girlfriend if she wanted a specific type or if she preferred the pizza untouched. The initial request was vague, so maybe the author shares some responsibility for not being clearer. \n\nBut given that the pizza was a specific, expensive choice the author was craving, the girlfriend altering it without asking might be the bigger issue. The author's anger, while perhaps intense, might stem from feeling disrespected. The girlfriend's lack of consideration in modifying the pizza without discussing it with the author could justify the author's reaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were more inconsiderate. So the answer is B.\n"
