It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering a specific, expensive pizza they craved. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he gets. He orders it, eats two pieces, and then later finds out she took toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is that he was expecting her to just take a couple of pieces or maybe some toppings off a few, but she took from all the pieces. He felt it was selfish because he paid for the pizza and didn't expect her to ruin what he ordered. The girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't take all the cheese, just some, and she thought it was okay since he already ate his own pieces. She found his reaction childish.\n\nSo, the key factors here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she would take a small amount, maybe a couple of pieces or some toppings off a few slices, but she took from all. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of what she did would bother him. Also, the fact that she said she'd have some of what he got could imply she expected to take part of the pizza he ordered. However, modifying every piece might be seen as excessive, even if some people might just take a few.\n\nAnother angle is that the author ordered the pizza for himself but also considered offering to her. If she was going to take from the pizza, maybe she should have asked or been more considerate of his preference. However, the author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to be eaten as is, so perhaps her actions were based on her own needs without full knowledge of his expectations.\n\nThe argument escalated because of the unexpected action and the lack of communication. The author's reaction might be seen as over the top because it's just food, but the girlfriend's action could be seen as disrespectful to the order. However, whether the author is in the wrong depends on if his anger was justified. If the girlfriend took too much and ruined the pizza, maybe not. But if he didn't communicate his preferences clearly, that could be his fault.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author didn't clarify that he didn't want her to modify the pizza, and the girlfriend didn't realize the extent of her action would be a problem. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he called her selfish and they argued, maybe the author overreacted. However, if the girlfriend did take all the cheese from every piece, that's a lot, and he might feel it was disrespectful. It's a bit of a grey area, but I think the answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's actions were clearly overboard. If she took all the toppings off every piece, that's excessive, and the author's anger is more understandable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and he had a valid reason to be upset, the answer is B.\n"
