It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, but would take some of what they ordered. Then when they ate, the author took two pieces, and the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces in the kitchen.\n\nThe author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author did order the pizza for themselves because they were craving it. They might have expected that since the girlfriend said she didn't want anything, she wouldn't take from it. But when they found out she took toppings off all the pieces, maybe they felt it was inconsiderate because they wanted to eat the pizza as is. The girlfriend might have thought since the author had already eaten two pieces, she could take what she wanted from the remaining ones, especially since she mentioned she didn't want a whole piece. Maybe she thought taking toppings off was better than eating a full slice, perhaps due to dietary reasons or just how she likes to eat.\n\nBut the author might feel that sharing food is implied when someone is eating in the same space, even if it's their own order. The girlfriend didn't ask, and took without permission, which the author could see as selfish. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since the author had already taken their share, she was just using what was left without being asked. The problem is that there's a mismatch in expectations. The author expected that the pizza was for them, and the girlfriend expected to take from it without being asked.\n\nIs getting angry over this proportional? The author called her selfish and childish, which escalated the argument. Maybe the anger is justified because it's a shared living space and sharing is expected, but maybe the reaction was a bit strong. However, the girlfriend taking toppings off every piece could be seen as taking more than she should, especially if the author was planning to eat the rest. The confusion part is that the girlfriend thought it was okay, but the author didn't. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely wrong because their reaction is based on the expectation that others would consider their food when they're in the same space. However, maybe the author could have communicated better or been more explicit about not wanting her to take from the pizza. Alternatively, the girlfriend should have asked before taking. But the author did mention they were \"starving\" and asked if she wanted anything, so she did say no. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong here because the girlfriend took without permission, and the author's anger stems from that. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
