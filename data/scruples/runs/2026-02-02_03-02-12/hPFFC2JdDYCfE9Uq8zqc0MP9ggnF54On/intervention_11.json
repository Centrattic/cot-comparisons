It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author ordered expensive pizza, offered it to his girlfriend, who said she'd have some. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back. He noticed she wasn't eating, asked why, and she said she took toppings off. When he checked, she'd removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, they argued.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong. But is that accurate? Let's consider both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He ordered pizza, expected sharing. She said she wanted some, but then took toppings from all the pieces. He felt she was being inconsiderate. He's frustrated because the pizza was expensive and a craving, and her actions made it hard to eat. He might think sharing is implied when you offer food.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. She might have thought taking toppings off was a way to have some without eating the whole slice. She didn't take all the cheese, just some, so she thought it was still edible. She got defensive when he called her selfish and thought his reaction was overblown.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he did order the pizza, but maybe assumed she'd take a slice or part of one. She interpreted his offer as allowing her to take toppings from all pieces. He might have overreacted, especially if the argument escalated. However, the act of modifying the pizza in a way that affects both of them without discussion could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut the key is whether the author is at fault. The initial request to order and offering food seems reasonable. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author could have handled it without calling her selfish and escalating. Maybe he should have discussed it calmly first. If he immediately reacted with anger and accusations, that might make him at fault for starting the fight. However, if her actions were truly inconsiderate, maybe he's justified. \n\nIt's tricky. But since the question is about who started the fight, the author's anger over the situation is the catalyst. However, both parties might share some responsibility. The user's position is that the author isn't wrong, but perhaps the answer is B (no), but I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. If the argument started because of his reaction to her action, maybe the author isn't wrong if her actions were the main issue. But if his reaction was disproportionate, then maybe A. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend took toppings off all pieces without considering the impact on the author's meal, the author's frustration is understandable. The argument might be about differing expectations of sharing. Since the author ordered the pizza for himself but offered it to her, she might have assumed she could take some, but not to the extent of ruining it for him. The author's anger stems from feeling that his meal was compromised without discussion. So, maybe he isn't wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
