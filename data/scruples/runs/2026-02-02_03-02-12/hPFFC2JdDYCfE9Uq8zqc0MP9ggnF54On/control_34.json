It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they really wanted. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He orders it, eats two pieces, then later notices that all the toppings and cheese were taken off every piece when he went to the kitchen. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and wanted that specific place. The girlfriend said she'd have some of what he ordered. There's an assumption here that maybe she would take a piece or two, but instead, she took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt that was inconsiderate because he paid for it and wanted to eat it. The girlfriend thought it was okay since he had already eaten a couple of pieces and the pizza was still edible.\n\nNow, to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions: They ordered pizza, asked her if she wanted anything, which she declined. Then they ate two pieces. When they went to the kitchen, they found that all the toppings were removed. The author reacted strongly, called the girlfriend selfish, and the argument escalated.\n\nPossible angles: The author might have assumed that the girlfriend would take a piece, but she didn't. However, she did say she'd have some of whatever he got, which could mean she expected to eat part of his order. The girlfriend took toppings off all pieces, which the author found offensive. The author might have overreacted, but the girlfriend's action could be seen as taking something that the author had paid for without permission.\n\nAnother point: The girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already eaten two pieces, the rest was fair game. But removing toppings from every piece shows a lack of consideration for the author's desire to eat the pizza as it was. The author might have a valid point that the girlfriend was being inconsiderate by taking toppings off all pieces, making the remaining pizza inedible for the author.\n\nHowever, the author could have communicated better. Maybe they should have specified that they wanted the pizza untouched. Also, the girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by not taking whole pieces but just some toppings. But taking from every piece is excessive.\n\nSo, the author's anger is about their personal property and food preferences being disregarded. The girlfriend's action was self-serving without considering the author's needs. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their reaction was intense. However, the girlfriend's action does seem selfish.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if the author's reaction was strong. The answer is B.\n"
