It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza because they were really craving it, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He orders it, eats two pieces, and then later finds out she took the toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend said she wanted some of whatever pizza he got, but when he ordered, she ended up not actually eating any and then later took the toppings off. The author felt she was inconsiderate because he thought she implied she wanted to share his order. But she said she didn't take all the cheese, just some. The author's reaction was anger, calling her selfish, and she thought he was overreacting.\n\nHmm. So, from the author's perspective, he followed through on his offer, expecting her to just take some of his pizza. But she didn't take a whole piece, just some toppings. However, he might have expected that if she wanted to take toppings, she would have done so without ruining all the pieces. The girlfriend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but maybe the author could have handled it without blowing up.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend said she didn't take all the cheese, so maybe she didn't think it was a big deal. The author's reaction was calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, she did take from his pizza without considering his feelings, especially since he was hungry and the pizza was expensive and craved. On the other hand, he might have overreacted by yelling and calling her names, escalating into a big argument. Maybe the author is wrong in the way he reacted, even if her action was inconsiderate. But the initial issue is whether the author's anger was justified.\n\nThe girlfriend might not have realized that taking the toppings off every piece would be unacceptable. However, since she agreed to have some of his pizza, taking a piece would make sense. Taking the toppings off all pieces might be beyond that. The author's anger could be seen as a reaction to a breach of trust or agreement. But maybe he should have communicated better instead of getting angry. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the girlfriend was inconsiderate, but the author's response was to call her selfish and start an argument. Maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong for feeling upset, but perhaps he shouldn't have blown it out of proportion. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his reaction was disproportionate. Since the girlfriend took multiple toppings and cheese off every piece, maybe the author's anger is justified. But the girlfriend's confusion and his calling her selfish might be where he went wrong. Maybe he's at fault for the way he handled it. But the initial anger might not be entirely his fault. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author's actions (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) are in the wrong, but his feelings are valid. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was appropriate. Since the question is \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable. If the author's response was yelling and calling her names, that's where the problem is. So maybe answer A (author is in the wrong) because he escalated it unnecessarily. But if the focus is on the initial anger due to her taking the toppings, maybe B. Hmm. \n\nI think the key is that the author's response was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The girlfriend might have been inconsiderate, but the author's way of reacting was not appropriate. So the answer is A.\n"
