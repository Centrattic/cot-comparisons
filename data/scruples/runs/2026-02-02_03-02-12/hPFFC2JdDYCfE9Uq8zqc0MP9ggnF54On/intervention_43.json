It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The key points here are the actions of both the author and their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific, expensive place because they wanted it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she would just have some of the pizza the author got. Then, the author ate two slices and went back to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back not eating, the author asked why. She mentioned she took toppings off some slices, but the author assumed she took from one or two. However, she actually removed toppings and cheese from every piece.\n\nWhen the author confronted her, she was confused and even accused the author of being a child. The argument escalated, and the author called her selfish. The user thinks the author isn't wrong because they were angry about their girlfriend taking what they wanted without considering the effort and cost involved.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author might feel that their choice to order a specific pizza was a shared meal, and the girlfriend's action of ruining all the slices could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and start a big argument, which might be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response of labeling her and escalating the argument could be seen as the author's fault for not handling it calmly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did take from all the slices without asking, which could be disrespectful given the cost and the author's preference. The author might have a valid point about feeling disrespected. However, the argument's escalation could have been avoided with better communication. The author's anger over the toppings might be justified if they expected the pizza to be shared as is, but the way they reacted (calling the girlfriend selfish and childlike) is where they might be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, but the author's response of calling her names and escalating to a big argument might have been unnecessary. The author could have communicated their feelings without being accusatory. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for the argument's escalation, making them in the wrong.\n"
