It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.

She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza between the author and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author was really craving pizza from a specific place because it's worth it even though it's more expensive. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. Then he orders it, takes two pieces, and goes to the living room to watch TV. His girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, she's not eating. He asks why, and she says she took some toppings off a few pieces. But when he checks the kitchen, he finds that she's taken toppings and cheese off every piece, which upsets him. They argue, and he calls her selfish, leading to a big fight. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for getting angry over this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author ordered pizza for both of them, expecting her to take a piece or share. When he found out she had taken toppings off all the pieces, he got angry and called her selfish. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because she didn't take a full piece but instead took from all, making the pizza less enjoyable for him. However, her reasoning was that he already had his two pieces, so she didn't take all of them, just some toppings. \n\nBut then, is it reasonable for the author to be upset? The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she would take a piece or maybe some toppings from one or two pieces, but she took from all. He might feel that by ordering the pizza, it's meant to be shared, and her actions compromised the meal he was looking forward to. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not have considered that taking toppings from all pieces would affect his enjoyment, especially since she didn't eat a full piece. \n\nBut is getting angry and calling her selfish justified? The author's reaction escalated the situation. Maybe he could have communicated his feelings without being confrontational. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and he did express his needs initially by offering her the pizza. The fact that she took from all the pieces without considering that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was might be the root of the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have checked the pizza before eating his own slices. Also, maybe the girlfriend's approach was a way to have some of the toppings without taking a full piece because she doesn't like the crust or something. But the author's frustration comes from feeling that his partner didn't respect his decision to order the pizza, expecting her to take a piece or not take so much. \n\nSo, in terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger might be seen as overreacting, but the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate. However, the author could have handled the situation without yelling and calling her selfish. Still, the initial problem was her not considering his needs. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the girlfriend took toppings from all pieces, even though he had already taken two, that might be seen as taking more than her share, especially if he was looking forward to eating the pizza as it was. The girlfriend's justification that he already had his pieces doesn't negate the fact that she altered the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment. \n\nTherefore, the author's reaction, while perhaps overly intense, might not be entirely his fault. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. However, the author could have handled it better. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, meaning his reaction was unjustified. If B, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate and the author had a valid reason to be upset, but his response was harsh. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's some responsibility on the girlfriend. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because he escalated it unnecessarily. \n\nBut considering that the author did express his needs initially (asking if she wanted anything) and she agreed to have some of whatever he gets, then she took from all the pieces, which isn't what he expected. His frustration is understandable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; the answer is B.\n"
