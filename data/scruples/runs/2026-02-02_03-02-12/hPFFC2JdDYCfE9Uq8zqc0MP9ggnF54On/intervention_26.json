It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. They ordered it, offered their girlfriend to join, and she said no, saying she would have some of whatever they got. The author took two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and then came back. The author noticed she wasn't eating and asked why, and she said she took toppings off. The author assumed she took toppings from one or two pieces, but when he went to check, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued, bringing up other issues. The author feels justified because he was hungry and thought she took without notice, but she was confused and said he was overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author ordered the pizza because he was starving and invited the girlfriend. She agreed to have some of what he got. The girlfriend might have assumed that the pizza was hers to take as she wanted, but the author thought they would share. The girlfriend's actions of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as not considering his feelings, especially since he had already taken two pieces. However, the author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which led to a fight. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author didn't specify how much pizza he ordered, whether it was enough for both. If he was only getting two slices for himself and the rest was for the girlfriend, she might have felt entitled. However, if he ordered a small amount and she took a lot, that's different. The problem is the lack of clear communication. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of the author's needs, and the author didn't clarify that the pizza was for both. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions of taking toppings off all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, but maybe she felt it was her way of eating. The author's overreaction might be because of his strong craving and the effort he put into getting the pizza. However, escalating to name-calling and a big argument seems disproportionate. The author could have expressed his feelings without calling her names, leading to a better resolution. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the fault might be on both sides. The author didn't set clear expectations, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her needs. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he took two pieces first and then the rest was for her, but she took from all pieces, maybe the author's anger is somewhat justified. However, the way he reacted with anger and calling her selfish might be where he's at fault. The girlfriend's confusion and his overreaction could be seen as his fault in escalating the situation. So, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the situation involved mutual misunderstandings, but the author's reaction, while intense, was about feeling disrespected, which isn't entirely his fault. However, some might argue that the argument was his fault for overreacting. But given the details, the author's perspective is that he felt disrespected, so perhaps he's not in the wrong.\n"
