It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting angry over their girlfriend eating the toppings off the pizza.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would eat some of what the author got. After the pizza arrived, the author ate two slices, and when they went to the kitchen, they found the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. The author got upset, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, the key points here are the expectations and communication. The author assumed that when the girlfriend said she didn't want anything, she might take just a little bit, like toppings off a couple of slices. But she ended up taking from all the pieces, leaving the author's pizza less desirable. \n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author had already taken their slices, she didn't need to leave any whole ones. She also said she didn't take all the cheese off, so it's still edible. But the author was upset because their remaining slices were now unsatisfactory.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Anger over something like this could be seen as overreacting, but it's also about personal boundaries and expectations. If the author clearly communicated their needs or if the girlfriend should have considered that the author might want the pizza as is, then the author might be justified. However, if the author didn't set clear boundaries, maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the issue. \n\nBut the author did mention they were craving that specific pizza, implying it was important to them. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as not respecting the author's preference, especially since they paid for it. However, the girlfriend might not have realized the extent of the author's preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the argument escalated into name-calling, which is a problem. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, and she called him childish. Both sides contributed to the argument. The question is whether the initial anger was justified. Since the author's main point was about the pizza being a specific craving and the girlfriend altering it without consideration, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the escalation might be their fault for not communicating better beforehand.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend also didn't ask for the toppings; she just took them. So maybe both had some responsibility. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both to improve communication. Since the user thinks the author isn't wrong, and considering the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the answer is B.\n"
