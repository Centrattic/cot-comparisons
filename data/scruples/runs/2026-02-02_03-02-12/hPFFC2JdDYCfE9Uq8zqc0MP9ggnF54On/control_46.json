It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering expensive pizza, eating two slices, and then finding out their girlfriend took toppings off every piece. They argue, and the question is if the author is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author ordered the pizza specifically, maybe because they craved it. Then the girlfriend said she'd have some of what they got. But when he ordered, she took toppings off every piece, which he found inconsiderate. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When the author asked if she wanted something, she said she'd have some of the pizza. The author might have assumed that meant she would take a slice or two. But she interpreted it as taking toppings off each piece. There's a miscommunication here. The girlfriend didn't clarify her request, leading to the misunderstanding. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger, calling her selfish. But maybe he should have checked in earlier when she was in the kitchen for a long time. He might have noticed the issue before finishing his own slices. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece could be seen as taking more than her fair share, especially since the pizza was expensive. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, sharing the pizza equally would make sense. If she wanted just some toppings, perhaps taking a couple of pieces instead of altering all of them would have been more considerate. The author's anger might stem from feeling that the pizza was wasted or that she wasn't respecting his purchase. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did order the pizza for himself, and the girlfriend did ask for some. He might not have considered that she might want to modify the toppings when he ordered. The argument could have been avoided if he had asked for her preferences when ordering. \n\nBut the main issue is the girlfriend taking toppings from every piece, which is a bit excessive. The author's reaction is about feeling disrespected, but maybe he overreacted. However, given that the pizza was expensive and he had already eaten some, his frustration is somewhat understandable. \n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might have miscommunicated. The girlfriend didn't specify her needs clearly, and the author didn't check in when she was away for a long time. But the act of altering all the pizza pieces without discussion is inconsiderate. The author's anger might be justified, but his approach (calling her selfish) could have been harsh. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while heated, stems from a reasonable expectation of shared pizza without modification.\n"
