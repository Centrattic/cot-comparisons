It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a close friend of Annie and Frank. Annie got married to Frank, who's in the oil industry with a long work schedule. The author suspected for a while that Annie was cheating, but there wasn't direct evidence. Then, when the baby was on the way, the author suggested a paternity test while they were drinking. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is being criticized for causing the marriage breakdown.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's intentions. The author felt something was off and, even though not sure, mentioned the paternity test. The context is that they were close friends, so maybe the author was trying to help. On the other hand, suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation. But the key point is whether the author acted in a way that's unjustified.\n\nAnnie and Frank's marriage had issues. The author's suspicion might have been based on observations over time. The author did approach the situation by asking Frank about the test, not directly confronting Annie. However, the author's comment during a drinking session might have been careless. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nBut wait, the text mentions Frank \"caught her emotional cheating.\" Emotional cheating is a form of infidelity, even if there's no physical affair. So maybe Annie was actually cheating, and the paternity test just confirmed the child wasn't Frank's. In that case, the author's suspicion was valid. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. So the question is, is it right to suggest a paternity test based on a feeling?\n\nAlso, the author lives far away and couldn't directly intervene. Maybe they felt compelled to act given the close relationship. But did they overstep? By suggesting the test, the author might have been trying to help Frank uncover the truth, which he later used to confirm the infidelity. If that's the case, maybe the author wasn't wrong. But others might argue that the author shouldn't have intervened, as it's private and the author's role was as a friend, not a detective.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The author is criticized for ruining the marriage. But if Annie was cheating, maybe the marriage was already doomed. The author's action might have expedited the inevitable. However, Frank might have stayed in the marriage longer otherwise, which could have been harmful. \n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them for the consequences. But is that fair? If the author was right, then they were just helping Frank avoid being a father to a child that isn't his and living with a cheating spouse. On the other hand, if the author acted without evidence, maybe they were reckless.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to help and the outcome was justified. But the method of bringing it up in a casual, drunken conversation might have been unwise. However, the result was that Frank discovered the truth, which he might not have otherwise. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might say that the author shouldn't have meddled in their private matters.\n"
