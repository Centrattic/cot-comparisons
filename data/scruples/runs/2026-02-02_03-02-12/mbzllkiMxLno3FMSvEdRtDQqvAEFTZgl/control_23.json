It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, let's call them \"Me,\" knew their sister-in-law Annie since they were babies. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. For three years, there were no direct confirmations of infidelity, but Me had a suspicion. Then when a baby was on the way, Me, after drinking a lot, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. That comment stuck, and Frank later insisted on a test. It came out that the kid wasn't his. Now, Annie has been left without Frank's six-figure income and the home, moving back in with her parents. Me is getting criticized by their family for ruining the marriage, but they stand by their actions, saying Annie created the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if Me's actions were wrong. So, the main points here are: Me made a suggestion after drinking, which led Frank to get a paternity test. The result revealed the baby wasn't his. Now, Frank and Me are ostracized by family and friends.\n\nThe question is whether Me is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Me's intention was to get to the truth, perhaps because they had a feeling something was off. But they didn't have concrete evidence. The problem is that Me's suggestion led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. But how responsible is Me for the outcome? \n\nI think it's important to consider that the paternity test would have probably been taken eventually if Frank found out on his own. However, Me's suggestion was the catalyst. If Annie was indeed cheating, then Frank has the right to know. But the way Me approached it\u2014after a lot of drinking and making a comment that might have been more offhand\u2014could be problematic. However, the fact that Frank acted on it later shows that he was already having doubts.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions are clearly wrong because she cheated and had a child with someone else. The author's role is to have brought up the suggestion, but was it their place to do so? If they had no proof, maybe they shouldn't have planted the idea. But given that they had a long-standing relationship with both Frank and Annie, and the marriage was breaking down regardless, perhaps Me was trying to do the right thing by encouraging truthfulness.\n\nThe family is blaming Me for ruining the marriage, but if the marriage was already broken due to Annie's infidelity, then the test just revealed the truth. It's a bit of a dilemma. The author's intention was to uncover the truth, which is a valid action, but the method might have been inappropriate. However, since the result was the truth coming out, maybe Me isn't in the wrong. The key here is whether Me acted recklessly or if they had a reasonable suspicion. The story says there was \"a feeling\" but no direct evidence. So, maybe Me overstepped by suggesting the test without being certain. But on the other hand, Frank ended up doing the test, which he needed to do anyway. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the main person at fault is Annie for cheating. The author's action was a contributing factor, but not the root cause. The family's reaction is harsh because they believe the author caused the problem. However, the author's intention was to help Frank discover the truth, which was already there. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
