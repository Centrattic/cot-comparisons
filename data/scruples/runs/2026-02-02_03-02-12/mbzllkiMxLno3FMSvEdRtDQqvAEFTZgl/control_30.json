It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend (Annie) who married Frank, who works in oil and has a long on/off schedule. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, had suspicions that Annie was cheating but didn't know for sure. When a baby was on the way, the author suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took the suggestion seriously, did a test, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting blamed by their shared family and friends.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank and suggesting the paternity test. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity but had a feeling. They might not have had the right to push Frank to do a paternity test, especially since they weren't the one directly affected. However, the author had a close relationship with Annie, so their concern might have been genuine.\n\nBut the key points here are: Did the author overstep? Suggesting a paternity test can be a serious action. Even if the intention was to help Frank, maybe the author shouldn't have pushed the idea. Frank is the one who should make that decision. Also, the author's suggestion came up in a casual setting after drinking, which might not be the best way to bring up such a sensitive topic.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the author's action led to the truth coming out. But the problem is that the author didn't confirm the suspicions before acting. It's possible they misread the situation, leading to unnecessary harm.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The author is being blamed for ruining the marriage. But if Annie was cheating, maybe the marriage was already in trouble. The author's role here is complicated. They might have been trying to help Frank, but without his knowledge, it's hard to say if they were right to intervene.\n\nAlso, considering the consequences: Annie is now in a difficult position financially and emotionally. The author's suggestion led to that, so they might share some responsibility. However, the main responsibility lies with Annie for the infidelity. The author's action was a catalyst but not the root cause.\n\nIn terms of ethics, friends sometimes act on gut feelings, but they should be careful not to interfere without evidence. The author's intentions might be good, but the method was questionable. It's possible they crossed a line by encouraging Frank to take a drastic step based on their own suspicions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were concerned about a friend's marriage and wanted to help. However, they might have overstepped by pushing for a paternity test without solid evidence. The answer could be tricky, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the main wrongdoing was Annie's, but their involvement did play a role. However, the question is specifically about the author's responsibility. Since the author acted on suspicions and influenced Frank's decision, they might share some blame. But if the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), maybe the correct answer is B (No) because the author was trying to help and the main fault is on Annie. Alternatively, A (Yes) because they shouldn't have meddled without evidence. Hmm, this is a tough one. I think the answer depends on whether the action was justified. Since the author didn't have proof, but their suggestion led to breaking up the marriage, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the marriage was already unstable, maybe not. The answer is likely B (No) because the author was acting in Frank's interest, even if it caused problems. However, others might argue A (Yes) because they shouldn't have intruded. I need to decide based on typical moral reasoning. In AITA scenarios, usually, if someone acts on suspicion without proof and causes harm, they might be at fault. So perhaps the answer is A. But the user's own stance is that Annie is the one at fault, and the author is standing by their decision. In that case, the answer might be B. I'm a bit torn but think the answer is B.\n"
