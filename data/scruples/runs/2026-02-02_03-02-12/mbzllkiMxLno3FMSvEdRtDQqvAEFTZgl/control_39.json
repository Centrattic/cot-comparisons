It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (let's call them \"the person\") is a close friend of Annie, who's married to Frank. The person suspected that Annie was cheating and, when Frank was home, suggested a paternity test after a couple of beers. Frank ended up getting the test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, the person is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial support and home. The person feels that Annie was the one who created the situation and that using the child's well-being as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The person was a close friend of Annie's, not Frank's. Did they have a right to interfere? Frank was the one who ended up taking action based on the suggestion, so maybe the person's role was just bringing up a suspicion. But is it right to suggest a paternity test without knowing for sure? The person might have acted on a hunch, which could be seen as invasive or meddling in someone else's marriage. However, they were concerned about Frank's paternity, which is a valid concern for Frank.\n\nThen, there's the question of trust and friendship. The person was close to Annie, so perhaps they felt protective of Frank. But since they were friends with Annie, maybe they should have approached the situation differently. However, they didn't have direct evidence, just a suspicion. Suggesting a paternity test is a big step, but it's Frank's decision whether to act on it. The person's advice stuck, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. But the person isn't the one who conducted the test; Frank did. So maybe the person isn't entirely at fault.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The person is being blamed by their family for causing the divorce. The family is saying they should have kept their mouth shut. But the person argues that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating. The child's well-being is also cited as a reason to not interfere, but the person thinks that's unfair. It's complicated because while the person might have felt they were helping Frank, their suggestion led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. However, the person's role was more of a catalyst than the actual cause. The real issue was the cheating, not the suggestion of a test.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships are complex. While the person might have had good intentions, suggesting a paternity test based on suspicion could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're a friend of the spouse. However, if they truly believed Frank was being cheated on and wanted to protect him, maybe it's a gray area. The key point is whether the person acted with bad intentions. If they believed they were helping Frank, but didn't have evidence, then they might not be entirely wrong. But if they acted recklessly without considering the consequences, then they might share some responsibility.\n\nThe person's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage, but the marriage was already in trouble because of Annie's infidelity. The person's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which is a natural consequence. So maybe the person isn't in the wrong because the marriage was unstable due to the cheating. However, the way they approached Frank about it could have been handled better. Maybe they should have talked to Annie first or given Frank a chance to address the issue without a test. But without concrete evidence, it's hard to know.\n\nIn conclusion, while the person might have overstepped by suggesting a paternity test based on a suspicion, they were trying to help Frank in a situation where he was being deceived. The main issue was Annie's infidelity, not the person's suggestion. Therefore, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
