It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with Annie, like a sister. Frank and Annie are married, and Frank works in the oil industry with a long on-off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because they live far apart. Then, when there's a baby on the way, the author jokingly suggests a paternity test after drinking. Frank later takes that suggestion seriously and gets a test, which reveals the baby isn't his. Now, the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and Frank is isolated, moving to the author's city.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm, let's consider. The author's initial comment was a joke after drinking, but it led to Frank getting a paternity test. Was the author justified in suspecting something? The user says Annie never directly admitted to cheating, just \"emotional cheating.\" Emotional cheating isn't the same as physical, but it can still be a form of infidelity. However, the author's suggestion might have been based on a gut feeling, not concrete evidence. \n\nBut then again, Frank did end up discovering the infidelity through the test. The author's comment was a catalyst, but does that make them at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author had no proof and just made a joke, maybe they overstepped. However, if they genuinely had suspicions and it turned out to be true, perhaps it's a necessary step. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for the breakup. They argue that the author shouldn't have said anything and that Frank is being immature. The author feels that Annie caused the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's comment led to the test, which exposed the cheating. But the author didn't have direct evidence. Was it their place to bring it up? In some perspectives, even if the action led to the truth, the author's intention was to help Frank. On the flip side, making such a suggestion without evidence could be seen as invading privacy or causing harm. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were acting on a suspicion, albeit a strong one, and it resulted in Frank uncovering the truth. But maybe the way they approached it was inappropriate. However, the main issue is Annie's cheating. The author's role was more of a catalyst, but not the root cause. The family's blame might be misplaced since Annie's actions were the real problem. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
