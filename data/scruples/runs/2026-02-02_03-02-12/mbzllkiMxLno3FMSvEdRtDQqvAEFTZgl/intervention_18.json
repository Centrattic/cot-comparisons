It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The story involves Frank, his wife Annie, and their marriage that ended due to infidelity and a child not being Frank's.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank was in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. When Frank found out the baby wasn't his, he got a paternity test, which the author's suggestion might have prompted. Now, the author is getting criticized by family for causing the marriage breakdown and is being told to consider the child's well-being and Frank's maturity.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate the facts. Did the author do something wrong? The author's action was suggesting a paternity test after drinking. But was that advice justified? The author had a suspicion based on feeling, but no concrete evidence. Suggesting a test might have led Frank to act on it, which revealed the infidelity. However, the author was not directly involved in the cheating; Annie was the one who cheated. The author's role was to voice a concern, albeit possibly prematurely. \n\nBut is the author responsible for the consequences? The author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. However, the cheating was Annie's choice. The author's suggestion might have uncovered the truth, which Frank eventually acted on. If Frank had not been aware of the infidelity, maybe the marriage would have continued with a lie. The author's intent was to help Frank verify paternity, which is a valid concern in a marriage with infidelity. \n\nHowever, the author's suggestion might have been made in a casual context (after drinking), which could be seen as insensitive. But the main issue is Annie's infidelity. The author isn't the one who cheated; Annie is. So the blame should be on her, not the author. The author's family is unfairly targeting them for speaking up. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by making the suggestion without knowing the full story. But given that the author had a suspicion and was close to both parties, offering to consider a paternity test could be seen as a responsible action to uncover the truth. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help Frank, even if it led to the marriage's end. The wrong was committed by Annie through her infidelity and emotional cheating. Therefore, the author isn't at fault.\n"
