It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them Alex) knew Annie since childhood and was close to both her and Frank. Frank was in a job that kept him away for 14 days, and Alex suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. When they found out Annie was pregnant, Alex jokingly suggested a paternity test after drinking, which Frank took seriously and ended up confirming the baby wasn't his. Now, Alex is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and is being told to consider the child and that Frank is being immature.\n\nSo the question is if Alex is in the wrong. First, I need to break down the key points. Alex had a suspicion but no direct evidence of infidelity. The suggestion of a paternity test was made in a casual, possibly drunken context. However, this suggestion led to Frank getting a test, which revealed the child wasn't his. The fallout caused the couple to break up, and now Alex is isolated and being blamed.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, was Alex's action justified? If there's no proof, suggesting a paternity test might seem like a violation of privacy or trust. But on the other hand, if Alex truly believed something wasn't right and the child's paternity could be in question, maybe it's a valid concern. However, the way it was brought up\u2014after \"more than a couple of beers\"\u2014suggests it wasn't a serious or considered suggestion. Frank might have been already suspicious and used Alex's offhand comment as a catalyst to act. \n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but the family is blaming them. The key here is whether Alex crossed a line by making that comment. Even if it was a joke, the suggestion came from a place of concern, but without evidence. However, the harm caused was real. Even if Alex didn't know the full extent, their words led to the breakdown of a marriage. So maybe they are in the wrong for not having proof and for making such a suggestion in a personal situation. \n\nBut wait, the article of the month (AITA scenario) often considers intentions and consequences. Alex's intention was to ensure Frank's involvement with the child, but their method was flawed. Also, Annie being the one who created the situation by cheating could shift some blame. However, the direct action leading to the test was Alex's suggestion. So while Annie's actions were the root cause, Alex's comment triggered the paternity test. \n\nThe family is blaming Alex for ruining the marriage, which might be unfair because the marriage was already strained due to Annie's infidelity. But the question is about Alex's responsibility. Did they overstep by suggesting the test without evidence or being clear with Frank? Maybe. The test was a direct consequence of Alex's words, even if it was a joke. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about how the person acted. If the author's action, even if well-intentioned, caused harm without sufficient cause, that could make them the \"asshole.\" However, if they had a legitimate concern based on something they noticed, even if unproven, maybe it's a gray area. The problem is that the test wasn't based on Frank's own evidence but on Alex's suspicion, which might not be enough. \n\nSo the answer could be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the underlying issue was Annie's actions. But some might argue that Alex shouldn't have meddled without proof, hence A (Yes, in the wrong). But the user's perspective is that the author is not wrong, so I need to consider that. The test was a result of Frank's own decision after Alex's comment. If Frank was already considering it, maybe the comment just gave him the push. The author didn't force the test, just suggested it. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The main point is whether the suggestion was justified. Without concrete evidence, it's hard to say Alex had the right to interfere. However, the fact that Frank ended up doing the test and the marriage ended because of it, even if Annie was the cheater, the suggestion might be seen as a contributing factor. But in the AITA context, if the main wrongdoer is Annie, then the author isn't the asshole. The family's blame might be misplaced. So I think the answer is B.\n"
