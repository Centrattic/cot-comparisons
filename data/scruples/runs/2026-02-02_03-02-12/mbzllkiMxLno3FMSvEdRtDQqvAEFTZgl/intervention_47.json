It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband by suggesting a paternity test. The scenario involves Frank and Annie, where Annie had an affair, and the child isn't Frank's. The author, being close to both, mentioned the idea of a paternity test after some drinks, which led to Frank finding out. Now, the author is facing backlash from family for \"ruining the marriage\" and feels Annie is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's action was justified. The key points here are the context of the suggestion. The author had a feeling something was off for years but couldn't do much due to distance. The paternity test was suggested during a casual conversation after alcohol. The author didn't have proof but suspected infidelity. \n\nIn many cases, when someone suspects infidelity but lacks evidence, bringing it up can be tricky. However, the author's intention seems to be helping Frank uncover the truth. The test confirmed his suspicions, which led to Frank ending the marriage. \n\nNow, is the author at fault? If Annie was indeed cheating, then the author's role in revealing the truth might be seen as right. But was the suggestion made in a responsible way? The author wasn't directly accusing Annie but planted the idea in Frank's mind. The problem here is whether the author overstepped by making a suggestion that led to the breakup, even if the marriage was already problematic. \n\nOthers might argue that the author shouldn't have interfered, especially since it was a private matter. However, given the long-standing suspicions and the author's close relationship, their concern might be understandable. The family's criticism that the author ruined the marriage could be valid if the marriage was salvageable, but if Annie was already emotionally cheating and the child wasn't Frank's, then maybe the marriage was doomed. \n\nThe author's stance that Annie created the situation seems valid because she chose to cheat. The \"child card\" argument is tricky because the child isn't Frank's, so maybe the child isn't a valid point for keeping the marriage. However, the child's well-being is still a factor in custody and support. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they acted on genuine suspicions and helped Frank uncover the truth. The responsibility for the marriage's collapse lies more with Annie's infidelity. So the answer is B.\n"
