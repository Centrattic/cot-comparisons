It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after he found out Annie had an affair and the baby isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The story is a year old. Annie and Frank were married for three years. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author, who's close to Annie (like a sister), suspected something but didn't have proof. After a visit where the author jokingly suggested a paternity test (over beers), Frank later took the test and found out the baby isn't his. The author's suggestion ended up leading to the discovery, which caused a lot of fallout. Now, the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated from friends and family. The author stands by their decision, thinking Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a suspicion, made a comment in a casual setting (after drinking), which Frank took seriously and acted on. The result was the discovery of the affair and the child not being his. The author is being blamed by their family for speaking up, even though they were close to Annie.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author had a close relationship with Annie, possibly like a sister. If they truly suspected infidelity but didn't confront Annie directly, but instead made a comment to Frank, that could be seen as overstepping. However, maybe the author thought they were helping Frank by pointing out the possibility. But since Annie was the one cheating, maybe the author's intervention was a way to expose the truth.\n\nBut the problem is, the author didn't know for sure. They just had a feeling. By suggesting the paternity test, they might have acted on a suspicion without evidence. However, in some cases, pointing out possible infidelity can be sensitive. Frank did later take the suggestion and get a test, which proved the author's suspicion correct. So the author's action led to the truth coming out.\n\nBut the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. Is the author responsible? Well, if the author had no proof and just made a comment, even if it was in a casual setting, it's possible they were right to express concern, especially if they knew the couple's situation. However, maybe they should have approached it differently, like talking to Annie first or not bringing it up to Frank unless they were sure. But if the author's relationship with Frank was closer than with Annie, maybe they felt it was their duty to help him.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. The author argues that using the child as a reason is unfair. But the child is a result of the infidelity, so maybe the author's intervention exposed the truth, leading to the child's paternity being known. That could be seen as a positive, but the way it came about might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is being blamed for the fallout, but the root cause is Annie's infidelity. The author's comment was a catalyst, but the main wrongdoing was on Annie's part. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, as they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth, even if it came from a suspicion.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author shouldn't have brought up the paternity test without being certain, especially since it could have caused unnecessary harm. But in this case, the author's suspicion turned out to be correct, which complicates things. If the author had no evidence, but their hunch was right, then maybe they were justified in suggesting the test.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support Frank, and their suspicion was valid even if it wasn't based on proof. The main responsibility lies with Annie for the infidelity and the lies. The author's role was to point out a possible truth, which turned out to be correct. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
