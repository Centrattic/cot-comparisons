It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, by suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close friends with Frank and Annie (like a sister). Annie married Frank, who's in the oil industry with long work shifts. The author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then, when the baby was coming, the author jokingly suggested a paternity test after some beers. Frank took it seriously and got one, which proved the baby wasn't his. Now the author is being blamed by family for breaking up the marriage. The author feels Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating, and they're standing by their suggestion.\n\nSo the question is: Was the author wrong to suggest the test? Let's break it down. \n\nThe author didn't know for sure about the cheating. They had a feeling, maybe based on intuition or past suspicions. But they made a comment in a casual setting, which Frank then acted on. The key here is whether the author's comment was a breach of trust or crossed a line. \n\nOn one hand, the author was concerned for Frank's well-being and the child's paternity. They might have thought it was a way to help Frank ensure the baby was his. But on the other hand, the author was a friend and not in a position to meddle in the marriage. Even if there were suspicions, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as invasive. \n\nAlso, the author didn't know the full story. Annie might have had reasons for her actions that weren't clear. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was unintended. However, the author's comment directly led to Frank taking action that exposed the infidelity. \n\nThere's a nuance here about the ethics of friendship. Friends often offer advice, but in this case, the advice (suggestion of a test) had significant consequences. The author might not be at fault if they genuinely thought it was in Frank's best interest, but the method of delivery (after drinking) and the lack of direct evidence could be points against them.\n\nAnother angle: The author's role as a friend. They were close to both parties, which might have complicated things. By suggesting the test, the author took a side, which could be seen as inappropriate. But if they believed Annie was unfaithful, it's a tough spot.\n\nAlso, the aftermath\u2014Frank catching her in emotional cheating, which might mean the marriage was already in trouble. The author's comment was a catalyst, but the root issue was Annie's actions. The author's family is blaming them, but maybe they're not entirely responsible. \n\nIn terms of morality, supporting a wronged friend by giving advice that leads to a breakup could be seen as justified if the other party was in the wrong. However, without concrete proof, the author might be overstepping. The line between helping a friend and meddling is thin here.\n\nI think the author's main fault, if any, is that they acted on suspicion without evidence. But their intention was to help Frank protect his family. The consequences were severe, but the responsibility lies partly with Annie for her actions and Frank for acting on the suggestion. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it differently. But the answer is either A or B. \n\nConsidering all this, I lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help and the main fault was Annie's. But there's a gray area. However, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong, and the analysis might support that.\n"
