It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, with the author being a close friend to both.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't prove it. When Frank was about to become a father, the author suggested a paternity test during a drunk conversation. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got a test, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and a home, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author defends themselves by saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. But was it right to bring it up in a casual, drunk setting? Maybe not the best approach. However, the author had a suspicion based on a long-term friendship, which might justify their concern. Frank was already having doubts, as the author mentions he was emotionally cheated on. The author's suggestion led to the test, but ultimately, the cheating happened first. \n\nThe author isn't the one who cheated; they tried to expose it. But by suggesting the test, they might have accelerated the divorce. However, without the test, Frank might not have realized the truth. The author's actions were in Frank's interest. The blame from family seems misplaced because the main issue was Annie's infidelity. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They might have had good intentions but the timing and context of the suggestion could be questioned. However, they didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. The real fault lies with Annie. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth. The answer should be B.\n"
