It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie. The author, let's call them \"Me,\" has been close to Annie as a sister. Frank is in a job where he's away for two weeks on and two off. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly said she was cheating, but Me felt something was off. Then, when there's a baby on the way, Me suggests a paternity test after a few beers. Frank later insists on getting one, which revealed the baby isn't his. Now, Me is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage, and Frank is isolating.\n\nHmm. First, the key points here are the author's suggestion of a paternity test, the context of their relationship with Annie, and the aftermath. Let's break it down. Me knew Annie had a history of emotional cheating, which Frank found out about. The suggestion came up in a casual, possibly drunken conversation. But the comment stuck, leading Frank to push for the test, which confirmed his fears. The author is now criticized for causing the breakup and is being told to consider the child and Frank's immaturity.\n\nIs Me at fault? Well, the suggestion of a paternity test might seem out of line if there were no prior signs of infidelity. However, the story mentions Frank suspected emotional cheating before. Me's comment might have been a catalyst, but if Frank already had doubts, maybe it was just a matter of time. The author didn't have direct evidence but sensed something was wrong. In that case, suggesting a test could be a way to confirm Frank's suspicions, not just a random accusation. \n\nBut did Me overstep? Maybe. Frank might have been considering the test already, and Me's offhand comment could have pushed him to act. However, the author's intent was likely to help Frank ensure the child's paternity, not to start a conflict. Also, since Me is close to Annie, maybe they should have approached it differently. But without concrete evidence, it's hard to say. The moral dilemma here is about whether the author had the right to intervene in this way.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was truly unfaithful and the child isn't Frank's, then the marriage was already problematic. The author's action might have been necessary to prevent Frank from raising a child that isn't his. But perhaps Me could have handled it more privately or supported Frank in a different way. Still, if the suspicion was there, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. The criticism from family might be unfair, given that Annie's actions were the root cause. The author is being blamed for speaking up, but if they knew about the emotional cheating, maybe it's reasonable to question the paternity. \n\nSo, weighing it all, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank by suggesting a test. But they might not have the full context and acted on a feeling rather than facts. However, since emotional cheating can indicate the possibility of physical infidelity, the suggestion could be seen as reasonable. The main issue is the secrecy and lack of direct communication from Annie. Therefore, the author might be partially to blame but not entirely. However, in the AITA scenario, the focus is on whether the author is in the wrong. Given that Me was supporting Frank and acting on his suspicions, even if it led to the test, it's a tough call. But since the test was necessary to confirm the truth, and Annie's actions were deceitful, the author might be in the right. So, answer B.\n"
