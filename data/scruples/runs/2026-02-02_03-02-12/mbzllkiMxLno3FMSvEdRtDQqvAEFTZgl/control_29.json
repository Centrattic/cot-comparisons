It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, by suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister, Annie, married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author had a feeling Annie was cheating but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. When the couple announced a pregnancy, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got a test, and found out he wasn't the father. The author's comment led to the marriage breaking down, and now the author is being blamed by family. The author thinks Annie was at fault, and the family says they should have kept quiet.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to bring up the paternity test. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, did the author have a reason to believe Annie was cheating? The author mentions it was more of a feeling, not direct evidence. So maybe they didn't have concrete proof. But they had a suspicion based on not being able to shake the feeling, perhaps from knowing Annie well. \n\nThen, the author brought up the suggestion during a time when Frank was drinking. The timing might be questionable. If it was a casual conversation after a few beers, maybe the author didn't think it through. But Frank took it seriously, which led to him getting the test. \n\nNow, the author's intention was likely to help Frank, thinking he might not be the father, which could explain the author's suspicion. However, by suggesting the test, the author might have acted without concrete evidence, which could be seen as interfering in the marriage without knowing the full story. \n\nBut wait, Frank eventually did get the test, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. So the author's suggestion did lead to the truth coming out. But the problem is that the author didn't have definitive proof and might have acted on a hunch, which could be seen as causing unnecessary harm. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating (as the husband found out she was emotionally cheating), then the author's action might be justified in exposing the infidelity. However, the author's role here is as a friend to both Frank and Annie. By suggesting the test, the author might have overstepped, especially since they weren't present to gather more evidence. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for ruining the marriage. But if Annie was cheating, she's the one at fault. However, the author's intervention did cause the marriage to end, so the question is whether the author had the right to interfere. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people often have the right to express their concerns, especially if they suspect harm. But without evidence, inserting oneself into someone else's relationship can be problematic. The author might not be wrong entirely, but there's a case to be made that they acted without enough proof and caused disruption. \n\nBut Frank did end up getting the test, which proved the truth. So maybe the author was right to be concerned, but the way it was handled could be questioned. The author's suggestion led to the truth, but how they approached it might have been inappropriate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if someone is trying to help a friend uncover infidelity, they might not be wrong. However, if they act without evidence and cause damage without knowing the full story, there's some fault. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth, even if it was based on a suspicion. Alternatively, A (the author is wrong) could be argued because they acted without evidence, leading to a breakup that they might not have been responsible for. \n\nBut the key here is that the author's action led to Frank getting the test, which confirmed the infidelity. So maybe the author was right to voice their concern, even if it was a hunch. However, the method (suggesting a paternity test after drinking) might not have been the best approach. \n\nBut since the outcome was the truth coming to light, and Annie was indeed cheating, the author's role might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
