It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves their sister-figure Annie, her husband Frank, and the author's role in the breakdown of their marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood, almost like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. During their marriage, Annie was supposedly seeing someone else, but it wasn't directly confirmed. The author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test, which led Frank to get one. The test showed the child wasn't his, and the author's suggestion came out, causing fallout. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is being criticized by family for not keeping quiet, and the author feels Annie created the situation by cheating. The author and Frank are now isolated and Frank is moving away.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for suggesting the paternity test? Let me think about the ethics here. \n\nThe author's concern was based on a feeling, but they weren't certain. However, Frank ended up finding out through the test that he was cheated on. The author's suggestion led to Frank taking action, but was that the right thing to do? \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping Frank by pointing out the possibility, especially if they sensed something was off. But on the other hand, the author didn't have concrete evidence and was influenced by their own suspicions. By suggesting the test, they might have unnecessarily caused the breakup of a marriage if the situation wasn't as clear-cut. \n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. The author is defending their position by saying Annie was the one who created the situation. But the author's intervention played a direct role in the outcome. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it the author's responsibility to intervene when they suspect infidelity? Not necessarily. They weren't in a position to know for sure. However, by suggesting a paternity test, they might have acted on a hunch without confirming the facts. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if they weren't close enough to the situation to be certain.\n\nOn the flip side, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child wasn't Frank's, then the author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might be necessary for Frank to make an informed decision. But the problem is that the author might not have the right to push someone else into taking such a life-altering step based on their own suspicions.\n\nAnother angle: The author's intention was to help Frank, but the method was questionable. Maybe they should have approached it more carefully, like discussing with Frank first to understand his feelings instead of suggesting a paternity test directly. That could have been a more responsible approach.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help based on their concerns. But there's a case to be made that they acted without sufficient evidence and caused harm. However, since Annie was indeed cheating, the outcome might have been inevitable. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author's role in suggesting the test was appropriate. If the author didn't have a direct reason to believe Annie was cheating beyond their own suspicions, then suggesting the test could be seen as meddling. However, if the author had valid reasons or observations, it's a different scenario. The story says it was more of a feeling, not concrete evidence. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the primary wrongdoing was Annie's infidelity. The author's role was a catalyst but not the root cause. However, the author's actions did contribute to the breakup. So whether that makes them in the wrong depends on the context. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to interfere in others' relationships unless invited. The author might have overstepped by making a suggestion that led to the marriage ending. Therefore, they might be partially at fault. \n\nBut given that the marriage was already built on Annie's deceit, the truth coming out was necessary. The author might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to uncover the truth that was hidden. \n\nBut the way they did it\u2014without being asked and based on a feeling\u2014could be problematic. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, the answer options are A or B. If the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nConsidering the author's intention was to help and the outcome was that the truth was revealed, maybe B is the answer. However, the method of getting there was questionable. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because the main issue was Annie's actions. But others might see the author as having pushed Frank to take a drastic step. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a legitimate intervention or meddling. Since they acted on their own suspicion without being certain, it's more likely they were in the wrong. So answer A. But I'm not 100% sure. Another perspective might be that they weren't to blame for the breakup because Annie caused it. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. If the author's suggestion led to the breakup, then they contributed to it. However, the main cause was Annie's infidelity. The author's role was a trigger but not the root cause. So maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the author's suggestion was an overreach. So answer A. I'm torn. But given that the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, and the author is defending themselves by saying Annie was the one who created the situation, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because the main responsibility lies with Annie. Therefore, answer B.\n"
