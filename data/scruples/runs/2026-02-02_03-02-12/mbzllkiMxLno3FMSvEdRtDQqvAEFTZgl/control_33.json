It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about Frank and Annie. Annie was married to Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author, who's close to both, noticed that Annie might be cheating. The author suggested a paternity test to Frank during a visit, which he eventually did. The test revealed the kid wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a close friend to both Frank and Annie. They suspected infidelity but didn't have direct evidence. The author's suggestion led Frank to get a paternity test, which confirmed the suspicion. Now, the author is being blamed for the fallout. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test. The author claims they were just trying to help Frank, given the circumstances. However, the author might not have concrete evidence beyond a \"feeling.\" Suggesting a paternity test is a big step, as it can destroy a marriage if the result is negative. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If Frank had trust issues, maybe he should have addressed them directly with Annie first. The author's role as a friend is to support, but advising a paternity test without clear evidence could be seen as meddling. However, the author's intention was to help Frank avoid being cheated on and to confirm the paternity. \n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions (emotional cheating and having a child with someone else) are clearly wrong. The author's action, while potentially intrusive, was aimed at uncovering the truth. The problem is that the author's suggestion led to the marriage's collapse, even if it was due to Annie's infidelity. \n\nBut is the author responsible for the consequences? If the author didn't know for sure and just acted on suspicion, maybe they shouldn't be blamed. However, bringing up such a sensitive topic without being certain could be seen as a breach of trust towards Annie. The author's close relationship with both parties might have given them some leeway, but it's still a delicate situation.\n\nThe family's criticism is that the author should have kept quiet. The argument is that the author's suggestion caused unnecessary harm. However, the alternative is Frank staying in a marriage with a child not his, which could have long-term consequences. The author's intention was to help, but the method might have been questionable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if there's a suspicion of infidelity, it's usually up to the involved party to address it. The author's role is to support Frank, but suggesting a paternity test is a step that should ideally come from Frank himself, not a friend's suggestion. So maybe the author did overstep, even if with good intentions.\n\nBut then again, if the author had no evidence, they might have just kept their thoughts to themselves. However, the fact that the author noticed something and acted could be seen as trying to prevent Frank from being wronged. The moral dilemma here is tricky.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the infidelity was real. But the method of confronting it by suggesting a paternity test might have been hasty. However, since the author was a close friend, perhaps their concern was valid. The family's criticism is harsh, but the author's action did lead to the marriage's end, so there's some responsibility there. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author's intentions were good, but the action might have been inappropriate. However, since the underlying issue (Annie's cheating) was real, the author isn't entirely at fault. The primary responsibility lies with Annie, but the author's role in exposing it could be seen as justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
