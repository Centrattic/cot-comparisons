It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author (let's call them Person X) is close to Annie, who's married to Frank. Frank is away a lot due to his job. Person X sensed something was off and, after some drinking, suggested a paternity test. That led Frank to find out the baby wasn't his, and now they're all in a mess. The author is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and is defending their stance, saying Annie was at fault.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here: Did Person X overstep by bringing up the paternity test? They didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Maybe they were wrong to push Frank into it. But on the other hand, Frank ended up being cheated on, and the child isn't his. So, maybe Person X was trying to help.\n\nBut wait, how much do they know? They admit they had a feeling but no proof. Suggesting a paternity test based on a feeling might be crossing a line. Even if the outcome was right, the method could be questionable. Also, the author's family is upset because they feel it's their problem, not Person X's to interfere.\n\nThen, considering the consequences: Annie is now without a home and income because Frank left. The author's family is blaming them. But the author argues that Annie created the situation. Maybe the author is right in the sense that Annie's infidelity caused the problem, but is that enough to justify the author's actions?\n\nThe author's intention might have been to help Frank, but they might have acted without knowing the full story. Maybe Frank had other reasons for the paternity test, and the author's comment just pushed him over the edge. Alternatively, without the test, Frank might have continued being lied to and cheated on for longer.\n\nAlso, the emotional cheating aspect\u2014Frank caught her at it. So even if the paternity test wasn't the only issue, there's emotional infidelity. But the author's role in suggesting the test might have been the trigger.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they acted without evidence and caused a break-up, that's a problem. But if they were trying to expose a cheating spouse, maybe they're justified. However, in relationships, it's usually up to the partners to address issues, not friends. So maybe the author overstepped by interfering.\n\nOn the flip side, if Annie was the one cheating, and the author knew something was wrong, maybe they had a right to be concerned. But again, how much do they really know? They admit it was based on a feeling, not facts. So perhaps the author is wrong for acting on that feeling without confirmation.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they intervened without clear evidence, leading to a family breakdown. Even if the outcome was the truth coming out, the method was problematic. Friends shouldn't be the ones to push a paternity test unless it's a direct request or there's clear evidence. So, the author overstepped, making them at least partially responsible for the fallout.\n"
