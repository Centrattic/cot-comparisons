It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend, Annie, who was cheating on her husband Frank. The author, who is close to both, suggested a paternity test after getting the idea that the baby might not be Frank's. The test confirmed it wasn't his, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. Now, the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. On one hand, Annie's infidelity is wrong, but the author's role is in question. \n\nThe author mentions that they had a feeling Annie was being unfaithful but didn't have direct evidence. They made the comment after drinking, which led to Frank getting the test. The author's intention might have been to help Frank, but the method might be questionable. \n\nIn relationships, if one partner suspects infidelity, the decision to take action should ideally be between the two people involved. The author, as a friend, might not have the right to intervene directly, even with good intentions. Suggesting a paternity test could be seen as encouraging Frank to confront the situation, but it's possible that the author shouldn't have pushed for it without more concrete evidence. \n\nHowever, if Annie was indeed cheating, then the author might be helping Frank uncover the truth. But the way it was done\u2014through a friend's suggestion after drinking\u2014might not be the best approach. The author could have advised Frank to talk to Annie directly instead of jumping to the test. \n\nThe aftermath shows that the author and Frank are now isolated, and the author is being blamed. The author's family thinks they shouldn't have said anything. The question is whether the author had the right to meddle in their friends' marriage. \n\nIn many ethical perspectives, it's generally advised not to take sides in someone else's relationship unless there's clear harm. The author's action led to the dissolution of the marriage, which has consequences for everyone involved. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's role in exposing the infidelity might not absolve them of responsibility for how it was handled. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be seen as overstepping their bounds, even if their intent was good. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
