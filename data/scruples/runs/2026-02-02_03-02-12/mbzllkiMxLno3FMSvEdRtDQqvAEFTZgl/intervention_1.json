It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is close friends with Annie, who's married to Frank. The author has always considered Annie a sister. Frank works in the oil industry and is away for two weeks on and two weeks off. Over three years of marriage, Annie never openly admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. Then, when they find out Annie is pregnant, the author, after some drinks, suggests Frank consider a paternity test. This suggestion ends up leading Frank to get the test, which reveals the baby isn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and their home, and the author is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The author is defending their action, saying Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's role in suggesting the paternity test. The author was concerned about Annie's possible infidelity but wasn't sure. The suggestion came after a few beers, which might have made the author less careful. However, the paternity test was ultimately Frank's decision to pursue, even if the author's comment planted the idea. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author might have overstepped by bringing up the paternity test when they weren't certain. On the other hand, they had a suspicion based on their relationship with Annie and Frank's situation. The author's intention was to ensure Frank wasn't being deceived, which could be seen as trying to do the right thing. However, the method of bringing it up, especially after drinking, might have been inappropriate or tactless.\n\nAlso, the consequences are severe: the marriage ended, Annie is now in a difficult financial situation, and the author is ostracized. The author's family is upset, arguing that the author shouldn't have intervened. The author believes Annie was at fault for the cheating, so they see their role as justified.\n\nBut in terms of responsibility, did the author have a right to question the paternity? Maybe not. Since the author isn't a family member, just a close friend, they might not have the authority to push Frank towards a paternity test. Even if they suspected something, pointing it out in a way that led to the test could be seen as overstepping. However, if the author had no malicious intent and was trying to help Frank, perhaps it's not entirely their fault.\n\nThe fact that Frank decided to get the test himself is important. The author's suggestion was the catalyst, but the decision was Frank's. So maybe the author isn't entirely responsible. However, the way they approached it might have been a mistake, especially under the influence.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer depends on perspectives. If the author acted with good intentions but in an inappropriate manner, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they had no right to question the paternity and acted recklessly, they could be in the wrong. Given the circumstances, the author's intent was to help Frank, but the method was flawed. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to protect Frank from being deceived, even if their approach was questionable.\n"
