It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, Frank and Annie got married, and the user is a close friend of both. The user has a suspicion that Annie might be cheating, especially since Frank is away a lot. The user brings up the idea of a paternity test during a casual conversation after drinking, which Frank later acts on. The test reveals the baby isn't his, and the user is now being blamed for ruining the marriage. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the paternity test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They mention that they had a feeling something was off but didn't have concrete evidence. They were concerned, maybe even worried about Frank. But they brought it up in a social setting, possibly when Frank was not in the best state to make such a decision (after drinking). The user thought they were being helpful, but their suggestion led to a situation that caused a lot of damage.\n\nThen there's the aspect of boundaries. As a friend, the user might not have the right to question Annie's fidelity unless there was clear evidence. Cheating is a personal matter between a couple, and unless the user was explicitly asked for their opinion, bringing up a paternity test might have overstepped. The user's actions might have forced Frank into a decision he wasn't ready to make, especially since he was under the influence.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the user is now being blamed by their family and friends. The user's parents and siblings think they should have stayed out of it. The user is standing by their decision, thinking Annie was at fault. But does that make the user right? Even if Annie was cheating, the user's intervention might have been too direct and possibly unwise.\n\nAnother angle: the child's well-being. The user argues that Annie created the situation, but the child is now involved, and people are bringing up the child's interests. The user dismisses that, but maybe there's a responsibility to consider the child's welfare in all of this. However, the user's role is a friend, not a parent, so their responsibility is different.\n\nAlso, the user's actions caused Frank to take a step that led to the marriage's collapse. Even if it was the right decision in the long run, the user's role in prompting that might be seen as interfering. The user might have overstepped their role as a friend by pushing Frank towards a paternity test, especially with no clear evidence.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend. But the way they did it\u2014suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence and in a casual setting\u2014could be seen as meddling. The question is whether the user's actions were necessary or if they should have stayed out of the couple's private matter, even if they had suspicions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user's intentions were good, but their actions might have been inappropriate. They might not be completely in the wrong, but there's a case to be made that they overstepped. However, if the user is not in the wrong, then the answer would be B. If they are in the wrong, then A. Given that the user was concerned and acted on a hunch, maybe it's a gray area. But since the user's suggestion led to the paternity test, which caused the breakup, even if Annie was unfaithful, the user's role in causing the situation might make them partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they intervened without being asked and possibly caused the marriage to end.\n"
