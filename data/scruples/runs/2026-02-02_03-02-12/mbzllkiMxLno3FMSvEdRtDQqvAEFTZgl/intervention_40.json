It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, and suggesting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a close relationship with Annie, who is like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in a job that keeps him away for two weeks at a time. The author suspected something was off but couldn't act on it because of the distance. Then, when the baby was announced, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later took that suggestion seriously, leading to the discovery that the child isn't his. Now, the author is facing criticism from family and friends for causing the breakdown of the marriage, and both the author and Frank are isolated.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author thought Annie was being unfaithful but didn't have concrete evidence. Their suggestion was based on a feeling, not proof. However, they admitted to Frank that the baby might not be his, which led to the test. The test confirmed the author's suspicion, but it also caused a major fallout. The family is blaming the author for ruining the marriage, and the author feels they're in the right because they believe Annie was at fault.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a moral standpoint, if someone suspects infidelity but doesn't have proof, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as interfering. However, the author's intention was to help Frank confirm the truth, especially regarding the child's paternity, which is a significant issue. The author might argue that they were protecting Frank from a potential lie. On the other hand, the author didn't have the right to make that suggestion without being certain, and it did lead to the breakdown of Frank and Annie's relationship.\n\nBut the story also mentions that Annie was emotionally cheating, which is a form of infidelity even if not physical. Emotional cheating can still be a breach of trust. The author's role here is complicated because they were close to both parties. Their advice, while perhaps well-intentioned, did have real consequences. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, the truth would eventually come out, and the author's suggestion might have been a catalyst for Frank to address it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were acting on their suspicions and tried to help Frank. But they didn't have the right to make that suggestion without being sure. The real fault lies with Annie for the infidelity. However, in terms of interpersonal relationships, the author's actions did cause a rift, which is why some might blame them. \n\nLegally, unless the author had proof of infidelity, they can't be held responsible for the consequences of the paternity test. Morally, it's a gray area. The author acted on their suspicions, which were correct, but the manner in which they did it led to significant problems. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they also didn't handle the situation perfectly. However, the main wrongdoer is Annie, not the author. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
