It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author has a close friend Annie, who's married to Frank. The author has known Annie since they were babies, and Annie's sister is more of a friend to the author. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years, the author feels that Annie might be cheating, but there's no direct evidence. Then, when Annie gets pregnant, the author, during a conversation after drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank later takes the advice, finds out the baby isn't his, and the marriage breaks down. Now the author is blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and they're both isolated. The author supports Frank and is sticking to their belief that Annie is to blame.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author act wrongly in suggesting the paternity test? The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. But they mentioned it in a casual way. Then Frank acted on it. The question is whether the author should have kept quiet.\n\nFrom one angle, the author had a suspicion based on their long-term friendship with Annie. They might have felt it was wrong that Annie was cheating emotionally, even if there was no proof. By suggesting the test, they were trying to help Frank discover the truth. If the situation was as the author suspected, then Frank was being deceived, and the author's action led to the truth coming out. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to prevent Frank from being wronged.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't have concrete evidence. Maybe they were just projecting their feelings without knowing for sure. Suggesting a paternity test is a serious step that could destroy a marriage. If the author's suggestion caused unnecessary harm without proof, they could be seen as meddling. Also, the fact that Annie's part-time job means she's the one left without financial security might mean that Frank is taking advantage of the situation, and the author's role in that is questionable.\n\nThe author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, but if the marriage was already on shaky ground due to Annie's infidelity, then maybe the author isn't to blame. The author might have thought they were helping Frank uncover the truth to fix the relationship. However, the way the suggestion was made\u2014after drinking\u2014could imply that the author wasn't entirely serious or that they might have been influenced by alcohol, making the comment more impulsive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Frank \"caught her emotional cheating,\" which means there was an issue with the marriage. If Annie was emotionally cheating, then the marriage might not have been healthy, and the paternity test revealed the child wasn't Frank's. So the author's action led to a situation where Frank had to confront the reality of his marriage, which might have been necessary but painful.\n\nBut the author is now isolated and blamed. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test. If they had no proof, maybe they shouldn't have suggested it. However, given their close relationship with both Annie and Frank, maybe they felt it was their duty to help Frank see the truth.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author acted out of concern for Frank's well-being and the truth, they might be justified. But if they acted out of jealousy or to ruin Annie, that's different. The text doesn't mention jealousy, so it's more about concern. Since Frank took the suggestion and acted on it, the author's role is indirect. The main responsibility lies with Frank for deciding to take the test, not the author for suggesting it.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They had a suspicion, tried to help, and the result showed their suspicion was right. Frank's actions led to the outcome, not necessarily the author's suggestion. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
