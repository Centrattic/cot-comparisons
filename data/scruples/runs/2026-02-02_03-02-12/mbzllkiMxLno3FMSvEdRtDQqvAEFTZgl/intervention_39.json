It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story (let's call them the author) is in the wrong for supporting Frank, the husband who was cheated on. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author is close friends with Annie, who was married to Frank. Frank was away a lot due to his job. The author sensed something was off and, after some drinking, suggested a paternity test. The test revealed the baby wasn't Frank's. Annie was emotionally cheating. Now, Frank is estranged from family, and the author is also getting blamed.\n\nThe author's stance is that Annie created the situation, and using the child as a reason to criticize Frank is unfair. They're standing by their suggestion of the paternity test.\n\nNow, considering the moral implications. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. But by suggesting the test, they helped Frank uncover the truth. On one hand, the author might be seen as overstepping, as they weren't in the marriage and didn't have all the facts. But on the other hand, they trusted their instincts and wanted to ensure the child was Frank's, which is a valid concern in a situation of suspected infidelity.\n\nAnnie's actions are clearly wrong\u2014cheating and not being honest. The author's role is to support a friend (Frank), which is understandable. The author didn't force the test; they made a suggestion that Frank acted on later. The problem is that the author's suggestion led to the breakup, which affected everyone involved. However, the root cause was Annie's infidelity, not the author's suggestion.\n\nThe family blaming the author seems harsh because they didn't make Frank take the test; he made that decision himself. The author's intention was to ensure the child's paternity, which is a responsible action given the circumstances. While the author might have had a sense of guilt for causing the breakup, the main wrongdoer here is Annie.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They acted on a suspicion to help a friend uncover the truth. The real issue is Annie's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
