It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who supported their sister-in-law's husband after she cheated. The author, let's call them the narrator, has a close relationship with their sister Annie. They've known each other since childhood. Annie married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a long work schedule. The narrator noticed something off and suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank discovering Annie was emotionally cheating and the baby wasn't his.\n\nNow, the question is whether the narrator is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the narrator's intentions. They had a feeling something was wrong and, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. They thought it was a good idea to confirm if the child was Frank's. It turned out the child wasn't his, and the narrator's comment triggered the test. But was that interference justified?\n\nOn one hand, the narrator might have believed they were helping Frank by ensuring he wasn't raising someone else's child. If Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe the narrator felt it was important for Frank to know the truth. However, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as intrusive. The narrator wasn't in a position to know for sure, just a feeling. So, maybe they overstepped by pushing for the test.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was cheating, the father of the child might have a right to know. The narrator's sister might not have been honest, and the child's paternity is a significant matter. The narrator might be trying to protect Frank from being deceived. But the method of suggesting the test after drinking might have been careless. Also, the narrator's family is blaming them, which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe aftermath shows that Annie is now in a tough spot financially and emotionally, and Frank is moving away. The narrator is isolated too. The key points here are intent and action. If the narrator genuinely wanted to help Frank uncover the truth, their action might be seen as justified, even if it caused turmoil. But if they acted out of suspicion without basis, they might be at fault.\n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional cheating. The husband caught that, but the child's paternity is the main issue. The narrator's suggestion led to the test. Was it right to bring up the paternity test? Maybe Frank should have done it himself if he had doubts. But the narrator's role here is tricky. They might have been trying to help, but perhaps they shouldn't have interfered in someone else's marriage so directly.\n\nAnother angle: the narrator's relationship with Annie is like a sibling. Maybe they felt it was their duty to look out for Frank, especially if they noticed something was off. But without evidence, it's hard to say. The child's paternity is a big deal, but the narrator's actions led to the breakup and financial difficulties for Annie. Is it fair to blame the narrator for that?\n\nAlso, the narrator's family is shaming them, saying they ruined the marriage. But if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the marriage was already in trouble. The narrator might not be to blame because the root cause was Annie's actions. However, the catalyst was the narrator's suggestion, so they might share some responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the narrator acted on a suspicion and suggested a test that changed everything. While the truth came out, the method and timing might be questioned. The answer could be either way. But considering that the narrator's intention was to ensure Frank wasn't being deceived, which is a valid concern, but the way they approached it (after drinking and without strong evidence) might have been inappropriate. However, the primary wrongdoer here is Annie for cheating. The narrator's role is more of an enabler to Frank's decision, not the cheater themselves. So maybe the narrator isn't in the wrong. However, they might have overstepped by intervening in the marriage. Depending on cultural or personal beliefs about privacy, the answer could vary. But in many cases, if someone is being honest and trying to help a friend uncover a truth that the other partner is hiding, even if it leads to bad outcomes, they might not be entirely at fault. The fault lies more with the cheating partner. So the answer is B (No).\n"
