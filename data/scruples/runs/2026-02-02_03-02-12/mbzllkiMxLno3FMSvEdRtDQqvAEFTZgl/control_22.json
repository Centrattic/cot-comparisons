It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated. So, the author, let's call them Alex, has been friends with Annie since childhood. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but Alex had a suspicion. Then, when there was a pregnancy, Alex, after some beers, suggested Frank might want a paternity test. That suggestion stuck, leading Frank to get a test, which revealed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is in a tough spot financially and emotionally, and Alex is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Alex's intention was likely to help Frank by pointing out a possible issue. But was that the right approach? Cheating is a serious matter, and emotional cheating can be tricky because it's not always clear. Annie didn't explicitly say she was cheating, but Alex had a feeling. However, without concrete evidence, bringing it up to Frank might have been a risky move, especially after drinking. People can say things they don't really mean when they're drunk, but in this case, the suggestion led to a paternity test that confirmed the infidelity.\n\nNow, the question is whether Alex was wrong to make that suggestion. On one hand, if the marriage was being affected by the cheating, maybe it's better to address it. But Alex is a friend, not a spouse, so they might not be in the best position to make that call. Also, Annie and Frank were supposed to work through their issues themselves. By suggesting a paternity test, Alex might have acted as a de facto spouse, which isn't their role. \n\nAnother angle is that Annie created the situation by being unfaithful. If the marriage was already strained by her infidelity, then the breakup is a consequence of her actions. Alex's suggestion might have just revealed what was already there. However, the way Alex approached it\u2014after drinking and making a casual comment\u2014might not have been appropriate. It's possible that Frank was already having doubts and Alex's comment gave him the push to act. \n\nAlso, the aftermath is that Annie is now in a difficult position without Frank's income. But she was the one who cheated, so perhaps she's responsible for that outcome. Alex is being blamed by family members, but the root cause is Annie's actions. The author's family is saying Alex should have kept quiet, but Alex's intention was to help a friend. \n\nIn terms of ethics, intervening in a relationship isn't always wrong, but it's a gray area. Friends have a duty to care, but they shouldn't overstep. If Alex had no proof of Annie's infidelity, just a suspicion, then bringing it up could be seen as meddling. However, if the marriage was already on the rocks, maybe the suggestion was justified. The fact that the paternity test confirmed the infidelity shows that Frank needed to know, but the method of revealing it was through a friend's suggestion after drinking, which might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the suggestion was a well-intentioned but misguided act, it might not be entirely their fault. However, since it was made after drinking and without evidence, it could be considered meddling. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and Frank needed to know, then perhaps the author helped uncover the truth. But since the author isn't a spouse, they might have overstepped. The family is upset because the marriage ended, but the real issue is Annie's actions. The author's role was to support a friend, but the method was questionable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, given the outcome, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because of the way the suggestion was made without evidence, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since Annie was the one who cheated, the author might not be at fault. The answer could be B (no).\n"
