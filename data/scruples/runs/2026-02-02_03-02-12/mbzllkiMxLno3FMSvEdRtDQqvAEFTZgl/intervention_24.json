It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie was cheating and had a child with someone else. The author, who's close to Annie, suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery. Now, Frank and the author are being criticized by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author suspected something but didn't have concrete proof. They made a comment during a drunken moment, which Frank later took to heart and got a paternity test. The test confirmed the child isn't his. The author is now facing backlash from family for speaking up.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, suggesting a paternity test might seem like an overstep, but the user's reasoning is that Annie created the situation by cheating. The author didn't have evidence, but they had a feeling. However, bringing up such a sensitive issue, even if it's a suspicion, could be seen as crossing a line. Frank might have been in denial, and the author's comment pushed him to confront the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was cheating and hiding it, maybe the author was trying to help Frank. But the problem is that the author didn't have proof. Even if their intentions were good, making that comment could be seen as interfering in someone else's marriage without knowing the full story. The family is upset because the marriage was broken up, and the child's well-being is being cited as a reason to be quiet.\n\nBut then again, if Annie was being dishonest, maybe the author was right to point it out. The author's position is that Annie caused the problem, and they're standing by their suggestion. The family's reaction is that the author should have stayed silent. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author might have thought they were helping, but without evidence, it's a risky move. The fact that the child isn't Frank's is a major issue, and the author's comment triggered that. However, the real wrongdoing was Annie's infidelity. The author's role is more about whether they had the right to intervene. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to uncover the truth, which led to Frank knowing the truth. But others might argue that the author shouldn't have meddled. Since the user's position is that the author isn't wrong, I need to see if that's justified. The key is whether the author had a right to suggest the test. Since it's a close relationship and the author had suspicions, maybe they were justified. So I lean towards B.\n"
