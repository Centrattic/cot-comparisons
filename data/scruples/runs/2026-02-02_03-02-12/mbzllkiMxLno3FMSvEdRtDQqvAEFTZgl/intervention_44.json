It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that Annie, who's like a sister to the author, married Frank. Frank was away a lot for work. The author had a feeling Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because they were far away. Then when Annie got pregnant, the author suggested a paternity test to Frank after some beers. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and moving back in with her parents. The author is getting flak from family for causing the marriage to break up and being out of line.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author's main action was suggesting a paternity test. The key points here are intent and context. The author says they had a \"feeling\" but didn't have proof. They might have thought Frank was being paranoid, but given the situation with Frank working long shifts, infidelity is a possible scenario. The author's suggestion led to Frank taking action that exposed the infidelity.\n\nBut is the author responsible? Well, Frank is an adult and had the choice to act on the suggestion. The author wasn't certain, just had a suspicion. However, the suggestion was made in a casual setting after alcohol, which might imply it wasn't a serious advice. But Frank took it seriously, so maybe the author should have considered the consequences. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, the author might have thought they were helping Frank out. The problem is that the author's words led to a breakdown in the marriage, and now they're being blamed for it.\n\nMoral responsibility here is tricky. The author didn't force Frank to get the test; Frank made the choice. But the suggestion was the catalyst. Did the author overstep by bringing up the idea? Since the author is close to both, they might have thought they were helping. However, inserting oneself into someone else's marriage to that extent, even if concerned, could be seen as meddling. But the author had a sisterly relationship with Annie, so maybe they felt justified in being concerned.\n\nAnother angle: the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. Is that fair? The author's action led to the truth coming out, but if Annie was the cheater, then maybe the marriage was doomed. The author's role is complicated because they had prior suspicions. However, without concrete evidence, suggesting a paternity test might be seen as unwise. But in the end, it turned out the author was right, but the fallout is harsh. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author acted with good intentions but without proof, it's debatable. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have stayed out of it. Since they were close to Annie, they might have felt it was their place, but crossing that line into influencing a spouse's decisions could be problematic. However, since the marriage was indeed affected by infidelity, the outcome might be seen as the right one, even if the method was questionable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author had suspicions and acted on them with the intention of helping Frank. While the suggestion might have been intrusive, the result was uncovering the infidelity. The author isn't at fault for a marriage that was already in trouble. The blame is more on Annie for the cheating. The author's family is being unfair in their judgment.\n"
