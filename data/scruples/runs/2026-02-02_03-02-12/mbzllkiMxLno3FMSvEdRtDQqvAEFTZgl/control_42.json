It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's sister, Annie, who married Frank. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected Annie was cheating because Frank is away a lot for work. Then when Annie gets pregnant, the author suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank finding out the child isn't his. Now the author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage, and Frank is estranged from family and friends.\n\nFirst, the author's role here. They mentioned their suspicion to Frank, which led him to get a paternity test. But was that the right move? The user is asking if the author is at fault. \n\nWell, if Annie was actually cheating, maybe the author was trying to do the right thing by encouraging Frank to confirm the paternity. But the problem is that the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Even though they were close to Annie, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up without being sure. \n\nBut then again, Frank ended up finding out the truth, which might have been better in the long run for him. However, the author's suggestion directly led to the breakup, and now Frank is struggling. The author is being criticized by their family for interfering. \n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional cheating mentioned. If Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe the marriage was already in trouble. But the author's comment might have been the catalyst for the test and subsequent breakup. Did they overstep by suggesting the test? It's possible that Frank should have addressed the issue himself without the author's push, but the author's intention was to help Frank avoid being a \"deadbeat dad.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have all the facts. They based their suspicion on a feeling and proximity to Annie. Maybe they should have talked to Frank more directly about their concerns instead of implying a paternity test. Or maybe they should have given Frank space to handle it without interference.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the consequences. The author intended to help Frank, but the method led to a breakdown in the marriage. The question is whether their actions were justified. Since they didn't have proof and acted on a hunch, it's possible they overstepped. However, the alternative is letting Frank be deceived further, which could have worse consequences later.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author's action was well-meaning but misguided. They might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to protect Frank, but they might not have the right to intervene that directly. However, others might argue that the author had no right to influence Frank's personal decisions without his consent. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted without certainty and possibly caused unnecessary harm, even if their intentions were good.\n"
