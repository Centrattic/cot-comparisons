It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage where Annie cheated, and the author, who's close to Annie, suggested a paternity test that led to the discovery of the infidelity.\n\nFirst, the author's main action was bringing up the idea of a paternity test after several beers. The story mentions that the author had a feeling Annie was cheating but couldn't act on it due to distance. The key point is whether suggesting the test was wrong. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they believed Annie was being unfaithful and thought the test would confirm their suspicions. Frank ended up doing the test, which revealed the child wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. They were close to Annie and might have felt responsible to intervene. However, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as an invasion of privacy. But given that the marriage was already strained due to Annie's possible infidelity, the author might have thought they were helping Frank. \n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them, but the author stands by their action because they believe Annie was at fault. The child's well-being is mentioned as a point against the author, but the child's parentage was a result of Annie's actions, not the author's. \n\nThe author's intent was to help Frank uncover the truth, which he did. While the method might have been a bit pushy (saying it during a drunken moment), the outcome led to Frank taking action. The isolation from friends and family is a result of the fallout, not necessarily the author's direct fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted on a suspicion to help their friend, which turned out to be correct. While the approach might be questionable, the intent was good, and the outcome was a necessary revelation. So the answer is no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
