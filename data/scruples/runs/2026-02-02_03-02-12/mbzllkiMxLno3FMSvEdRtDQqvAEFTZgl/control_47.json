It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with Annie, who's like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. When Frank found out the baby wasn't his, he got a paternity test, which confirmed it. The author's suggestion led to Frank testing, and since they were drunk, maybe the comment was offhand but ended up being taken seriously. Now the author is getting criticized by their family for causing the marriage breakdown, and both the author and Frank are isolated.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong to suggest the paternity test. On one hand, the author's intention might have been to help Frank confirm the truth, especially since Annie was suspected of cheating. Cheating is a serious issue, and Frank has the right to know if the child isn't his. The author didn't know for sure, but their concern was based on a feeling. However, the author might have overstepped by bringing it up, especially after drinking, which could have been unwise timing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have direct evidence and was acting on a suspicion. The fact that Annie was cheating on Frank, whether emotionally or physically, is the root problem. The author's suggestion led to uncovering the betrayal, which might have been necessary for Frank to address the situation. The author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it differently. Instead of suggesting a paternity test, perhaps they should have encouraged Frank to confront Annie first or seek counseling. However, given the circumstances that Annie never openly admitted cheating, the author's concern might have been valid. The author is being blamed for the fallout, but the responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie. \n\nThe author's family is criticizing them, but the main issue is Annie's infidelity. The author's role was to express a concern, which led to Frank taking action. Whether it's right or wrong depends on intent and the context. Since the author's intention was to get the truth and ensure Frank's rights (as a father and husband), maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, they might have acted without enough evidence, which could be seen as overstepping. But since it turned out the child wasn't Frank's, the outcome was justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author wasn't the one cheating and their action led to uncovering the truth, even if the method was questionable. The main fault lies with Annie, not the author.\n"
