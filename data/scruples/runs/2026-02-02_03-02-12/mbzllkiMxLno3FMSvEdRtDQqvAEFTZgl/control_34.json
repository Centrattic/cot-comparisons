It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Annie who's married to Frank. The author, let's call them the narrator, has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a work schedule of 14 days on, 14 off. \n\nThe key points here: The narrator felt that Annie was cheating because she suspected it for three years, but there was no direct evidence. Then, when Annie got pregnant, the narrator suggested a paternity test after some beers. Frank took the suggestion seriously, did the test, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the narrator is getting blamed by their family and friends. The narrator feels that Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the narrator did something wrong. Let's break it down. The narrator had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete proof. Instead of confronting Annie directly, they told Frank to consider a paternity test. The test led to the discovery that Frank wasn't the father. \n\nNow, the question is whether the narrator overstepped. Did they have the right to suggest the test? The narrator's intention might have been to help Frank, but they might not have considered the consequences. However, they weren't the one who actually discovered the infidelity; Frank did the test because of their suggestion. But the narrator didn't have evidence, just a feeling. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if you suspect someone is cheating, it's usually up to the partner to decide whether to confront them. The narrator might have crossed a line by pushing Frank to take a drastic step (paternity test) without evidence, but maybe they were trying to protect Frank. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed unfaithful, then maybe the narrator was trying to help Frank uncover the truth. \n\nThe problem here is that the narrator's suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage and the child's situation. However, if Annie was cheating emotionally and the child isn't Frank's, then the marriage was already problematic. The narrator's role was to support Frank, but they might have acted hastily. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Since they acted on a suspicion without proof, but Frank took it seriously and made the decision, maybe the responsibility lies more with Frank for acting on the suggestion. However, the narrator's suggestion was the catalyst. \n\nIn some perspectives, the narrator isn't wrong because they were trying to help a friend (Frank) uncover potential infidelity. In others, they might be wrong for interfering without evidence, especially affecting a family. But since the outcome was the truth being revealed, which was necessary, maybe the narrator isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No, the narrator isn't in the wrong) because they were trying to help Frank get the truth, even if it came from a suspicion. The real wrongdoer here is Annie for the infidelity. The narrator's actions led to the truth, which is important for Frank's well-being in the long run.\n"
