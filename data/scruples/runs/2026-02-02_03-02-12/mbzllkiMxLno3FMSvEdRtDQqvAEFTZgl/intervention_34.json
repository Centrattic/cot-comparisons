It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, Frank, and Annie.\n\nFirst, the author was close friends with Annie since childhood. When Annie married Frank, they got along well. Frank was in a job with a 14-on, 14-off schedule. The author suspected Annie might be cheating but wasn't sure. When Frank and Annie announced a baby, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got the test done, and found out the baby wasn't his. This led to the breakdown of their marriage, and now the author is facing backlash from their family for \"ruining\" the marriage.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author suspected infidelity, made a comment in a casual setting, which led Frank to take action. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have said anything. The author feels Annie was at fault for the cheating and emotional infidelity, so they're standing by their decision.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider ethical angles. The author's comment was a suggestion based on suspicion. They didn't have proof, but they felt something was off. The act of suggesting a paternity test might be seen as crossing a line, but it's also a way for Frank to verify his suspicions. However, the author's role in this is a bit indirect. They made a comment in a social situation, which Frank took seriously. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified in being concerned about the child's paternity, especially if there were signs of emotional cheating. On the other hand, the author didn't have concrete evidence and their comment led to the breakdown of a marriage. The author's family is upset because they feel it's not their place to interfere. \n\nBut considering that the author had a close relationship with both parties and the situation was already strained (due to Frank's job and potential infidelity), the author's action could be seen as trying to help. However, the method of bringing up the paternity test in a casual, possibly drunken manner might be problematic. It's possible that the author overstepped by making the suggestion without more evidence, but given the outcome, it's also possible they were trying to prevent a bigger issue later.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the primary responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie. The author isn't the one who cheated, but their suggestion was the catalyst. However, it's unclear if Frank would have ever considered a paternity test without the comment. So, maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. The family is blaming the author for the fallout, but that's their perspective. The author's intention was likely to help, even if the method was flawed.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were acting on suspicions and trying to get to the truth, even if the approach was a bit hasty. The real fault lies with Annie for the infidelity. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
