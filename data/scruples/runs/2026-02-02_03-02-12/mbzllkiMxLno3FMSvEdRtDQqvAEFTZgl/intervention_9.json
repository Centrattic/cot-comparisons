It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of Annie's infidelity.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The author has known Annie since childhood and feels close to her. Frank and Annie were married for three years, with Frank working long shifts. The author sensed something was off but couldn't act on it due to distance. The turning point was when the author, during a visit with alcohol involved, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, leading to the revelation that the child isn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage and is isolated along with Frank.\n\nThe author's defense is that Annie created the situation through her infidelity and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. The key points here are: Was the author's suggestion of the paternity test justified? Did the author overstep? And is the blame on the author valid?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting a friend (Frank) who was wronged by an unfaithful partner might seem justified. However, the author's suggestion, even if well-intentioned, played a role in exposing the infidelity. The question is whether the author had the right to interfere. The author wasn't a direct party to the marriage, just a close friend. Suggesting a paternity test based on a feeling without concrete evidence could be seen as overstepping, especially since it led to the breakdown of the marriage. \n\nBut then, Frank did act on the suggestion, so the author might not be entirely responsible. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure paternity, which is understandable. However, the method of intervention\u2014making a comment during a drunk conversation\u2014might have been careless. The aftermath shows that the author's action had significant consequences, leading to isolation and family criticism.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions (emotional cheating and having a child with another man) are clearly wrong. The author's stance that Annie is at fault is valid. The blame on the author for the marriage's collapse might be misplaced, as the marriage was already compromised by Annie's infidelity. However, the author's role in revealing the truth, even if indirectly, does place some responsibility on them, though perhaps not full blame.\n\nConsidering the context, the author acted out of concern for a close friend and family member. The situation is complex, and while the author isn't entirely in the wrong, their suggestion did contribute to the outcome. However, given that the marriage was built on deceit, the responsibility primarily lies with Annie. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
