It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author supported Frank after he found out Annie had cheated and the baby wasn't his.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Annie was emotionally cheating, which Frank discovered. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the revelation. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for causing the marriage breakdown and the consequences that followed.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author do something wrong by suggesting the paternity test? The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. But they were close to both Frank and Annie, so maybe they thought they were helping. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big step. Even if the author's intention was to help, they might not have considered the potential fallout. \n\nBut wait, Frank ended up getting the test because of the author's suggestion. The author's role here is more of a catalyst. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test when they weren't sure. The author might not have been in a position to know the truth, so their intervention could be seen as meddling. \n\nHowever, considering that Annie was cheating and the child wasn't Frank's, maybe the test was inevitable. The author's action led to Frank uncovering the truth, which he might have done eventually on his own. The question is whether the author had the right to push for it. \n\nThe author's family is upset because the marriage broke down, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. The author might not be at fault because they were trying to support Frank, even if it caused immediate problems. The real blame lies with Annie for the cheating. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's tricky. They might have overstepped by making such a suggestion without certainty, but their intention was to help a friend. The fact that Frank used the author's suggestion as a prompt could mean the author had no control over how it was used. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong because they were acting on a suspicion and wanted the truth to come out. In others, they might be seen as meddlesome. But given that the marriage was built on deceit, maybe the author's action was justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the primary issue was Annie's infidelity, and the author's role was to support Frank in discovering the truth, even if it led to a difficult outcome.\n"
