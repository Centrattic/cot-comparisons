It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the author.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author is a close friend of Annie, who married Frank. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete evidence. When Frank found out the baby wasn't his, the author's suggestion of a paternity test led to the discovery, and now the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The author is defending themselves, saying Annie was the one who created the situation, and they feel isolated now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's analyze the actions. The author had a suspicion but no proof. They mentioned the idea of a paternity test after drinking, which might not have been the best moment to bring it up. However, the main issue is that Annie was cheating, which Frank eventually discovered. The author's comment led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. \n\nBut was the author wrong to bring it up? The author's intention was likely to help Frank, given they were close friends. However, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as crossing a line, especially since it caused the marriage to fall apart. But Annie was the one who committed adultery, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for the fallout, which is unfair because the real fault lies with Annie. The author's actions were based on a suspicion, and they didn't know for sure. Even though the comment might have been the catalyst, the root problem was the infidelity. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have overstepped, but the situation is complex. The author's intent was to uncover the truth, which is understandable if they believed Frank was being honest. But without knowing for sure, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as meddling. However, considering the outcome, the author isn't the one who cheated. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's action was the primary cause. While the author's comment prompted the test, the underlying issue was Annie's cheating. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
