It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nSo, the author, who is like a sister to Annie, suspected that Annie was cheating on Frank. They didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling. Then, when Annie and Frank were expecting a baby, the author casually suggested a paternity test after some beers. Frank ended up taking the test, which revealed the kid wasn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and moving back with her parents. The author is getting blamed by family for breaking up the marriage and is being told to consider the child's well-being. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a suspicion. They mentioned the idea of a paternity test in a relaxed setting. Frank then took it, leading to the discovery. Now, the author is being criticized for causing the breakup.\n\nI need to consider if the author did something wrong. Did they have a right to bring up the paternity test idea? Well, if the author had no evidence, maybe it's crossing a line. But Annie was the one in the relationship. The author was concerned for their friend's well-being. However, suggesting a paternity test without solid evidence could be seen as meddling. But on the other hand, Frank ended up finding out the truth, which might be better in the long run.\n\nIs the author responsible for the fallout? They didn't know the baby wasn't Frank's. They had a suspicion, which turned out to be correct. But maybe they shouldn't have brought it up without more proof. However, the emotional cheating part is mentioned, so maybe the author had some reason. The test was the catalyst, but the responsibility lies more with Annie for the cheating. The author's role was to voice a concern, which led to the truth, but maybe they overstepped.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author acted in what they thought was the right thing, but without knowing the full picture. The problem is that their suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage. So is the author at fault? It's a gray area. But considering that Annie was the one who was unfaithful, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the method of bringing up the test in a casual setting might have been hasty.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to help Frank uncover the truth, which was eventually justified. Annie was the one who created the situation through cheating. The author's action, while perhaps premature, was based on a valid suspicion and led to Frank getting the truth, which is important for his life and the child's well-being. The fault lies more with Annie for the infidelity, not the author for suggesting the test.\n"
