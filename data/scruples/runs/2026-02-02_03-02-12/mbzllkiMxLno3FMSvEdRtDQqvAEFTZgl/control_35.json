It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, who was cheated on by his wife Annie, and the author, who supported Frank and suggested a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. Frank was working long shifts, and during their marriage, Annie was suspected of being unfaithful. The author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test, which led Frank to discover the affair. Now, Annie is without financial support and moving back home, while the author is facing backlash for causing the marriage breakdown.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author had concerns about Annie's infidelity and thought enough to bring up the paternity test. Frank acted on that suggestion, leading to the discovery of the cheating. But the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. \n\nIs the author wrong for bringing up the test? Well, if Annie was cheating and the author had suspicions, maybe they had a right to express that. However, the author might not have known the full context. But Frank chose to act on the suggestion and get a test, which confirmed the infidelity. The author's intention might have been to help Frank ensure the child was his, which is a valid concern when there's suspicion of cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have had the right to suggest such a serious step without knowing all the facts. However, since the suggestion led to Frank discovering the truth, the author could argue they were helping uncover the betrayal. The fact that Annie was emotionally cheating (as mentioned) might mean she was already in the wrong, so the author's role is more of an ally to Frank.\n\nThe family is criticizing the author for causing the breakdown, but if Annie was the one who cheated, then the author isn't the root cause. The author's action was a catalyst, but the real issue is Annie's infidelity. The author might be in the right for supporting Frank in his decision to find the truth, even if it led to the marriage's end. Also, the author was a friend to Frank, which might justify their involvement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author acted on their concerns, which led to uncovering the truth, and it's Annie's actions that caused the situation. The author's support for Frank in this case is understandable, even if it caused some fallout.\n"
