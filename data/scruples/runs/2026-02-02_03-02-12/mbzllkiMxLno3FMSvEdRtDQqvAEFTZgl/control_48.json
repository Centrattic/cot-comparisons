It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, Frank and Annie got married. Frank works in oil, so he's on for 14 days and off for 14. During their 3-year marriage, Annie never outright said she was cheating, but the author had a feeling. Then they found out they're having a baby. The author, during a visit with some beer, suggests Frank consider a paternity test. That suggestion sticks, leading Frank to get a test, which reveals the kid isn't his. The author is now getting flak from family for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was at fault and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. Now both the author and Frank are isolated and Frank is moving away.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author do something wrong by suggesting the paternity test? Well, the author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating. They just had a feeling. But by bringing it up, it led Frank to take action. However, the husband was already emotionally caught, as mentioned. The author's intention was probably to help Frank confirm his suspicions. But maybe the author overstepped by pushing for a test without more evidence. But on the other hand, if the wife was cheating and had a child with someone else, the husband has a right to know. The author's suggestion led to uncovering the truth, which might be the right thing, but maybe the way they approached it was inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author acted on a suspicion, not knowing for sure, but their action led to the truth coming out. The husband was already suspicious (emotional cheating mentioned), so the author's suggestion might have been a catalyst. However, the author didn't force Frank to do the test; Frank made the choice. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. On the other hand, maybe the author shouldn't have brought it up since they weren't certain. But in relationships, if one partner suspects infidelity, the other might need to confront it. The author's role here as a friend was to support Frank, which they did. So perhaps the author isn't wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. The author might have overstepped by suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence, which could be seen as meddling. However, given the outcome, the truth was revealed, and the author's intention was to help. It's a tricky call. But I think the author isn't in the wrong because the husband had a right to know, and the author acted as a concerned friend. So the answer would be B.\n"
