It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author has a close relationship with Annie, like a sister. Frank was in the oil industry with a work schedule that's 14 days on, 14 off. Annie married Frank, and they had a baby. The author sensed something was off and after some drinks, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. The test proved the baby wasn't Frank's, and the author's suggestion came back to affect their relationship.\n\nSo, the author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have said anything, causing the marriage to fall apart. The author defends their stance, saying Annie was the one who created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. Now both the author and Frank are isolated from their families and friends.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author noticed something was off but didn't have concrete evidence. They made a suggestion to Frank after drinking, which he acted on. The paternity test revealed infidelity. The author's family is upset because they believe the author interfered. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for suggesting the paternity test? Well, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then the author's suggestion led to uncovering the truth. However, the author had a feeling but no proof. Maybe they overstepped by bringing up the idea. On the other hand, if Annie was lying about the paternity, the author did the right thing by encouraging Frank to get a test.\n\nBut the author's intent might be questioned. Were they trying to help Frank, or did they act out of their own suspicions without being certain? Also, considering the consequences: Annie is now without financial support and a home, which is a big deal. The author's suggestion caused the marriage to break down, leading to isolation for both parties.\n\nEthically, is it the author's place to intervene? They weren't directly involved in the marriage, just close friends. They might have thought they were helping, but maybe they shouldn't have meddled. However, if they had a strong suspicion and the truth was eventually revealed, maybe their intention was good.\n\nAnother angle: the author's family blames them for ruining a marriage. But if Annie was the one who cheated, then the author isn't the one at fault. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the author didn't have proof, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as causing unnecessary harm, even if the result was accurate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. Acting on that feeling without evidence might not be the best approach. Frank might have been in denial, and the author pushed him to confront the truth, which could be seen as right, but the method might be questionable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's suggestion was a catalyst. But the ultimate decision to do the test was Frank's. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. So while the author's suggestion was a factor, the main issue is Annie's infidelity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help uncover the truth, even if it had unintended consequences. However, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up without more certainty.\n\nBut since the result turned out to be true, maybe it was a necessary action. Alternatively, they might have acted too hastily. It's a tough call. In the AITA context, often the person who causes the problem is the one at fault. But here, the author's action led to the truth coming out, which could absolve them. However, their friends and family think they ruined the marriage, which is a common AITA scenario where the person is blamed for causing a breakup.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because the author wasn't the one who cheated; Annie was. The author tried to help Frank by bringing up their concerns, even if it was after drinking. The real problem was Annie's actions. However, others might argue that the author shouldn't have interfered. But given the outcome, the author isn't in the wrong because the truth was the right thing to uncover, even if it led to the marriage breaking down.\n"
