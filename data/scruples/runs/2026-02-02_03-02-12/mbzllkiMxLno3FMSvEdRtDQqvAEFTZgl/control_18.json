It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where the author, who's close to both, had a suspicion that Annie was cheating, and after getting drunk, suggested a paternity test to Frank. The test revealed the child wasn't his, leading to the marriage breakdown. Now the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and they're defending themselves by saying Annie was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's role here is as a friend who noticed something off but wasn't directly involved. They mentioned their suspicion to Frank when they were both drunk. The question is whether the author crossed a line by bringing up the paternity test idea.\n\nSo, let's consider the facts. The author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity or the child not being Frank's. They just had a feeling. Even if they had a suspicion, the author might have overstepped by suggesting the test, especially in a casual setting where Frank might not have taken it seriously. However, the fact that the test led to the truth coming out means that Frank was indeed cheated on, and the child isn't his. So the author's suggestion, while perhaps impulsive, did uncover the truth.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't have proof, so raising the idea without evidence could be seen as making an accusation. Even if it was a suggestion, it's a sensitive issue. However, the author's intention was to help Frank, even if it was done in a poorly timed moment. The fact that Frank later followed through on the suggestion shows he had his own suspicions. \n\nThe author's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity and lying. The author's role was a catalyst, but the real issue was the existing marital problems. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend they care about. However, they could have approached it more carefully, perhaps discussing their concerns with Frank in a sober, non-confrontational way instead of making a comment after drinking. \n\nOn the other hand, since the author's comment led to Frank taking action, which exposed the cheating, maybe the author's intention was valid. The problem is more about how they communicated their concern rather than the concern itself. So the author might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The key is whether the author had a right to intervene. Since they were close to both and had a long history, maybe their intention was good, even if the method was flawed. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get blamed for causing a breakup, even if the underlying issues existed. So the author's actions might be seen as the direct cause, but the real fault lies with Annie. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the main issue was Annie's actions, and the author's suggestion, though impulsive, was to protect Frank. However, there's a nuance here because the way the author approached it was careless. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so considering the overall situation, the answer might still be B.\n"
