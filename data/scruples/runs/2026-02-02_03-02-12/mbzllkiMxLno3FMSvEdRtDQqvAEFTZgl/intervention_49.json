It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-like friend Annie, who married Frank. The author feels that Annie was cheating, and after a paternity test reveals the baby isn't Frank's, there's fallout.\n\nFirst, the author suggests the paternity test during a casual conversation after drinks. They thought they noticed signs of infidelity but didn't have concrete proof. The test confirmed their suspicion. Now, the author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage by their family. They argue that Annie was at fault and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's comment led to the test, which exposed the cheating. Annie was in the wrong for being unfaithful. But the author might be overstepping by suggesting the test without direct evidence. Even if they suspected something, bringing it up in a casual setting could be seen as intrusive. However, the fact that Frank acted on it shows he had doubts too. \n\nThe author's family is upset because they think they shouldn't have interfered. But if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author's action was justified to help Frank. The isolation both face complicates things. The key points are whether the author had the right to intervene and if their method was appropriate. Since there's no proof the author knew for sure, it's speculative. However, the outcome was that Frank discovered the truth, which he might have eventually. The author's intention might have been to help, even if the method was questionable. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
