It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is friends with Annie and Frank. Annie cheated on Frank, but it's not directly stated; the author had a feeling. Then, when the baby comes along, the author suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank finding out and the marriage falling apart. Now, the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage and causing problems.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. The author noticed something off for three years but didn't confront Annie directly. Instead, in a drunken conversation, they mentioned a paternity test. That comment stayed with Frank, leading him to push for the test. The result showed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is being criticized for their role.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the author's intention was likely to help Frank discover the truth. If Annie was cheating and the baby isn't his, maybe the author thought Frank had a right to know. But the way it was done might be problematic. The author didn't confront Annie first, maybe should have given her a chance to be honest. Also, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as a betrayal of trust in Annie. However, if the author genuinely believed Annie was being unfaithful and wanted to protect Frank, maybe they had good intentions.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a friend to both. By not staying neutral and instead influencing Frank, the author might have overstepped. Friends are supposed to support each other, but the author's action led to a breakup. However, if the marriage was already on shaky ground because of Annie's infidelity, then the author might have just exposed the truth.\n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. But if Annie's actions were the root cause, then the author isn't entirely to blame. However, the method of revealing the truth (through a casual comment) might have been inappropriate. Maybe they should have talked to Annie first or approached it differently.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to suggest a paternity test without being 100% sure? The author had a feeling, not concrete evidence. That adds a layer of uncertainty. If the author was wrong, they might have caused unnecessary harm. But if they were right, they prevented Frank from being wronged further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend discover the truth. However, their approach could have been better. But given the situation, maybe their intentions were good, even if the method was flawed. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but there's nuance here. Alternatively, maybe A because they didn't handle it properly. It's a bit of a tough call, but I think the key is that the author acted on a suspicion, not proof, which might make them at fault for not being more certain before suggesting the test.\n"
