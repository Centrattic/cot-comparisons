It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie. Frank found out through a paternity test that the baby isn't his, and the author suggested the test. The author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the author is a close friend, almost like a sister to Annie. They knew something was off but couldn't do much from afar. When they visited, after some drinks, the author mentioned a paternity test. Frank took it seriously and insisted on the test, which led to the discovery. The issue is whether the author should be blamed for causing the breakup.\n\nNow, the author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating. The author's actions were based on a suspicion they had for a long time. But did they have the right to bring up the paternity test? The author was in a position where they felt something was wrong, but without direct evidence. Maybe it was a way to confirm their suspicion. However, bringing it up could have been a sensitive move, especially after alcohol, which might have made the comment more impulsive.\n\nOn the other hand, Frank's reaction was to get a paternity test, which led to the truth. If the author hadn't suggested it, maybe the situation would have continued. But the author's intention was to help Frank, right? They thought they were protecting their friend from being deceived. But perhaps they overstepped by making the suggestion, even if it was based on intuition.\n\nThe friends and family think the author should have stayed silent. Is it their place to intervene? They might have a close relationship with both, so maybe they felt responsible. But relationships are private, and unless there was explicit consent, maybe the author shouldn't have meddled. However, if the author had a long-standing suspicion and a close bond with both, their concern might be seen as genuine.\n\nThe part about the child being used as a card is a point. The author is being told to think of the child, but if the child's father isn't Frank, maybe the child deserves to know the truth too. The author's stance that Annie created the situation is valid because she was the one cheating. The author's role was more of a catalyst for revealing the truth.\n\nBut is the author at fault for causing the breakup? If the marriage was already built on a lie, maybe the breakup was inevitable. The author's action just exposed it. In that case, the author isn't the one at fault; Annie's actions led to the situation. The author tried to help their friend by encouraging him to seek the truth. Even if the method was a bit hasty, the intention was good.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to help their friend and the situation was caused by Annie's infidelity. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might have been necessary even if it caused the breakup.\n"
