It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The scenario involves Annie, who married Frank, and the author's role in uncovering that Frank wasn't the biological father of the child.\n\nFirst, the author has known Annie since childhood, like a sister. Frank works in oil with a 14-on, 14-off schedule. The author sensed Annie was cheating but couldn't do much due to the distance. When the baby was on the way, the author jokingly suggested a paternity test after drinking. Frank took the suggestion seriously and insisted on a test, which revealed he wasn't the father. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is being blamed by family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. They made a comment in a social setting, possibly after drinking, which might not have been their intent to cause harm. However, the comment led Frank to take action. The author might argue they were trying to help Frank avoid being a father to someone else's child. Others might say the author overstepped, as they couldn't know for sure, and their comment caused the marriage to break down.\n\nBut the author wasn't directly involved in the cheating; they were a friend trying to look out for Frank. The real issue is Annie's infidelity and the emotional cheating, which Frank later discovered. The author's comment was a suggestion, not an accusation. However, suggesting a paternity test in that context might be seen as crossing a line, even if well-intentioned. On the other hand, if Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the author might feel they were helping Frank get the truth.\n\nThe family is criticizing the author for ruining the marriage, but Annie's actions led to the situation. The author might not be entirely wrong, as they weren't the one cheating. However, inserting themselves into the situation by making that comment could be seen as meddling. It's a gray area. The key is whether the author had a right to intervene. Since they were close to both parties and had concerns, maybe they thought they were helping. But the result was a broken marriage and isolation, so the author's intention vs. consequence matters here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider the intent. If the author's intent was to help Frank, but the method was inappropriate, they might be seen as wrong. However, if the comment was just a joke and Frank took it seriously, the author might not be at fault. The answer depends on whether the author's action was a reasonable way to address their suspicion. Since they didn't have concrete evidence, suggesting a paternity test might be overstepping. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is wrong) because they acted on a suspicion without knowing the facts, leading to consequences. But others might say Annie's actions were the real problem. However, the author's role in inciting the paternity test is the crux. So, probably answer A.\n"
