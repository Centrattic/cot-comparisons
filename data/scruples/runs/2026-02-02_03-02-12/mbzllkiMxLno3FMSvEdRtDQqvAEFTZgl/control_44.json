It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend Annie who married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. The writer feels Annie might be cheating, and when Frank finds out the baby isn't his, the writer is blamed because they suggested a paternity test. Now they're getting criticism from their family for breaking up the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key elements here. The author is close to Annie and Frank, acting as a sister. They noticed something off but didn't have concrete evidence. Then, during a visit, after drinking, they suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, did the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now the author is being blamed for the fallout. The author thinks Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating, and they're sticking to their belief that Annie is at fault.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the paternity test. Let's break it down. The author didn't have direct evidence of infidelity, just a feeling. They were worried about their friend's situation and Frank's potential financial support. But by suggesting the test, they might have acted on a suspicion without proof. However, the result was that the baby wasn't Frank's, so maybe the author was right to be concerned. On the other hand, maybe they overstepped by bringing it up, especially if Frank wasn't ready to confront it.\n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage, pointing out that Frank is now isolated and there's a child involved. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating. But the question is about the author's responsibility in suggesting the test. Did they have a right to interfere, or was it their place to do so?\n\nIn some cases, friends stepping in when they suspect infidelity can be seen as helping to uncover the truth, but it's also a delicate situation. The author might not have realized the impact their comment would have. However, Frank took it seriously, which led to the discovery. If the author had concrete evidence, maybe their action was justified, but since it was just a feeling, it's a grey area.\n\nAnother angle: The author's intention was to ensure the baby's paternity, which is a valid concern for Frank, especially financially. But the method of bringing it up in a casual setting after drinking might have been inappropriate. However, the outcome was that Frank got the truth, even though it caused a breakdown in the marriage. The author might argue they were protecting their friend from being cheated on and financially burdened.\n\nThe family's perspective is that the author shouldn't have meddled, leading to a breakup. But the author might feel they were helping a friend in a relationship where they were being cheated on. The key here is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test without evidence. Since the result was that the baby wasn't Frank's, the author's suspicion was correct, but the way they approached it might have been flawed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if Annie was emotionally cheating and had an affair, she's the one at fault. The author's role is more about whether they had the right to suggest the test. Since the author was acting from a place of concern, maybe their intention wasn't malicious. However, the outcome was the end of the marriage, which some might see as the author causing that. But if the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's actions, the author's intervention might have just accelerated the inevitable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky situation. They might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth. But they might have acted without sufficient evidence, leading to consequences they couldn't foresee. However, considering the outcome, the author's action did lead to Frank's financial and emotional upheaval. But Annie's actions were the root cause. The author's role is more of a catalyst, but not the main antagonist. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because Annie was the one who cheated, and the author was trying to help. However, there's a case to be made that the author shouldn't have intervened without proof. But given the result, maybe they weren't wrong.\n"
