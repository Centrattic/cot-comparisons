It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie. The author is the friend of both, closer to Annie as a sister. Frank was away a lot for work, and the author sensed something was off. After a baby announcement, the author casually suggested a paternity test during a drunk conversation, which led Frank to take it seriously and eventually find out the baby wasn't his. The fallout has been bad, with the author getting criticized for causing the marriage breakdown and the family shunning them both.\n\nFirst, the author's intent seems to be concerned about the possible infidelity. But did they overstep? The author didn't have direct evidence but felt uneasy. Suggesting a paternity test, even in a joking or offhand manner, might have been a sensitive move. However, if the author genuinely suspected something, maybe they had a right to voice their concern. But how was it delivered? The post mentions it was after a couple of beers, so maybe not the best time. However, the suggestion stuck with Frank, leading to the test.\n\nAnnie's actions were deceitful. She cheated, emotionally and maybe physically, leading to the baby not being Frank's. The author isn't the one who cheated, but their comment is what triggered the discovery. The family is blaming the author for ruining the marriage. But the root cause was Annie's infidelity. The author's role was to point out a suspicion, which is a gray area. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't have proof, but they were acting on a feeling. It's possible that the author overstepped by suggesting a paternity test without knowing for sure. However, they weren't the one committing adultery. The main wrongdoer is Annie. The author's intention was to help Frank realize the truth. So, while the method might have been questionable, the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author was trying to help someone they thought was being cheated on, and the real fault lies with Annie. The author's comment was a catalyst, but not the root cause. The family's reaction might be misplaced blame. So, the answer is B.\n"
