It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down. \n\nFirst, the author is close to Annie, practically a sister. Frank and Annie got married, and the author noticed something off but couldn't act on it because they live far away. Then, when a baby is on the way, the author suggests a paternity test after some beers. Frank later insists on the test, which reveals the kid isn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for causing the marriage breakdown and Frank is moving to their city, leading to isolation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author had a suspicion of infidelity but didn't have direct evidence. They made a suggestion in a social setting (after drinking), which Frank took seriously and acted on. The family is blaming the author for ruining the marriage and not considering the child's well-being.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Was the author justified in bringing up the paternity test? If they had no concrete evidence, maybe the suggestion was based on a gut feeling. But Annie's actions (emotional cheating leading to a child with another man) are clearly wrong. However, the author is being blamed for interfering. \n\nIn some cases, close friends might feel responsible to act if they suspect something, but without proof, it's a risky move. The author's suggestion could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if their intent was to help Frank. On the other hand, Frank might have been in denial, and the author's comment was a catalyst for him to confront the issue. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling, their comment might have been unwise. However, if they genuinely believed something was off and were trying to support Frank, that's different. The fact that Frank caught her in emotional cheating suggests he might have had his own suspicions. The author's role here is a bit like a concerned friend, but maybe they overstepped by making the suggestion in a casual setting. \n\nThe family is upset because the marriage ended, and they think the author shouldn't have brought it up. But Annie is the one who was unfaithful. The author's action, while perhaps intrusive, was aimed at uncovering the truth. However, the method (casually suggesting a test after drinking) might not have been the best approach. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a tough call. They acted on a suspicion without evidence, which could be seen as meddling. But they were concerned about a close friend. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. In some views, the author isn't wrong because the truth came out and Frank needed to know. In others, the author might have interfered too much. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author's intent was to support Frank, but the way they went about it might not have been appropriate. However, the main issue is Annie's infidelity. The author's suggestion probably led to the truth, which is ultimately the right thing for Frank to know. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. \n\nIf the author didn't have proof, just a feeling, and then suggested a paternity test in a social setting, that could have been a bad move. It's possible that even though the result was the same, the author shouldn't have been the one to push for it without being certain. Alternatively, if Frank was already considering it, the author's comment just gave him the nudge. \n\nHmm. It's a bit ambiguous. But since the user wants a simple A or B, I need to decide. The author's action led to the paternity test, which revealed the infidelity. The question is whether the author is responsible for the fallout. If they were only trying to help and their suspicion was valid, maybe not. But acting on a suspicion without evidence could be seen as meddling. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often get blamed for causing trouble. The author didn't have proof, so their suggestion might be seen as causing unnecessary conflict. But the child's paternity is a big issue. Frank was the one who ended up taking action. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the truth was important for Frank to know, and the author was trying to support him. However, the way they did it might be considered tactless. But in AITA scenarios, the main focus is on whether the action was inherently wrong. Since Annie was the one who cheated, the author's role is more of a concerned friend. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. But I might be missing something.\n"
