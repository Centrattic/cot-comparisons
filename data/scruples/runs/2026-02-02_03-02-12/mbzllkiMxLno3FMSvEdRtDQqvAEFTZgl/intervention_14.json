It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is close to Annie, who's married to Frank. The author feels that Annie might be cheating, but there's no direct evidence. The author suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank finding out the baby isn't his. Now, the author is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation. They've known Annie since childhood and care about her. They might have had a suspicion but didn't have proof. They suggested a paternity test, which Frank ended up doing. The key point here is that the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. If they had known for sure, they might have acted differently. But since it was just a suspicion, maybe they overstepped by bringing it up to Frank. \n\nThen there's the context of Frank's job. He's away often, which might have contributed to the relationship issues. If Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe Frank wasn't aware. By suggesting the test, the author might have pushed Frank to confront the issue, but perhaps they didn't have the right to do that without more evidence.\n\nThe consequences are significant: Frank found out, the marriage ended, Annie lost her financial stability, and the author is being blamed. The author's family is upset, saying they should have stayed out of it. The author argues that Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. But does that make the author right?\n\nIn terms of ethics, people should be cautious about making accusations without proof. Even if the author had suspicions, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as meddling. However, if the author genuinely believed there was a problem and tried to help Frank, maybe their intentions were good. But the outcome was harmful, so maybe they are at fault for not having the evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, if Frank had his own doubts and the test was his idea, the author might not be entirely responsible. The story says the author suggested it after some beers, but Frank later insisted on the test. So the author's suggestion was a catalyst, but the decision was Frank's. That might mitigate the author's responsibility. However, the author's comment was the initial trigger, so they might still share some blame.\n\nAnother angle: the author's relationship with Annie is close, but they weren't in a position to act as a mediator or accuser. They might have overstepped by bringing up the paternity test without talking to Annie first. But since they were close friends, maybe they thought they could help Frank without causing harm. It's a tricky situation where good intentions led to bad outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion to help a friend, but they did overstep by suggesting a paternity test without evidence. However, since Frank made the decision to do the test, the author's role is a contributing factor but not the sole cause. So the answer might be on the fence. But according to the options, the answer is either A or B. Considering that the author didn't have proof and the test was Frank's decision, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance.\n"
