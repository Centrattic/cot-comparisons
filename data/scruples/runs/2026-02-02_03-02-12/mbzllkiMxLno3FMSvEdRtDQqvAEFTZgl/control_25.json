It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, thought Annie might be cheating but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then when there's a baby on the way, the author, after some drinks, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously, gets a test, and finds out the kid isn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and their home, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was the one who created the situation and thinks it's unfair to blame them for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's comment about the paternity test was in a casual setting after drinking. But it led Frank to take action. The question is whether the author is at fault here. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have acted out of concern, thinking something was off. They had a close relationship with Annie, so maybe they felt it was their place to say something. But suggesting a paternity test is a big deal. Even if they were just making a joke or offhand comment, it's possible they didn't realize how it would affect Frank. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was actually cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then maybe the test was necessary. But the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. The author's intention might have been to prevent Frank from being deceived, but the method of bringing it up in a relaxed, possibly intoxicated setting could have been unwise.\n\nAlso, the author is being criticized by their family for intervening. The family's perspective is that the author shouldn't have meddled. But the author feels Annie was at fault. \n\nAnother angle: The author's role as a friend. They might have a responsibility to speak up if they strongly suspect something unethical. However, without clear evidence, it's a risky move. The author might have overstepped by making that suggestion, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. \n\nIs the author responsible for the consequences of Frank acting on their suggestion? Frank made the choice to get the test, so maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. However, the fact that the author's casual comment led to such a significant action might mean they share some responsibility, especially since they were close to both parties. \n\nAlso, the author's justification that Annie created the situation might be valid if Annie was indeed cheating. But the author didn't know that for sure at the time they made the comment. So maybe they acted on suspicion without proof. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. If you suspect someone you care about is being cheated on, is it your place to intervene? The method of intervention here seems to have backfired. The author's intention might have been good, but the execution was poor. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? It's possible they are, because they made a suggestion that led to the breakup without having solid evidence. Alternatively, they might not be wrong if they genuinely believed Frank was being deceived. But the way they approached it might have been inappropriate. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have kept their thoughts to themselves. Since they didn't have proof, suggesting a paternity test based on intuition could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
