It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (let's call them Person A) has a close friend named Annie, who they've known since childhood. Annie married Frank, who is in the oil industry and works long shifts. Person A suspected that Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. Then when Annie got pregnant, Person A, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously and did the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now, Frank and Annie's marriage is broken, and Person A is being criticized by their family for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Person A had a suspicion but no concrete evidence. They might have thought their comment was just a joke or offhand, but it led to a real action that changed things. However, Person A's intention was possibly to help Frank, given the suspicion of infidelity. But was it right to make such a suggestion without knowing the facts?\n\nOn one hand, Person A didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating. Their suspicion might have been unfounded. By suggesting a paternity test, they might have caused unnecessary harm. But on the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and intentionally making Frank raise a child that's not his, that's a major betrayal. Frank might not have confronted her without the suggestion, leading to a potential future discovery that could be even more traumatic.\n\nAlso, the fact that Annie was emotionally cheating and had a child with someone else is a significant issue. Person A might have been trying to prevent a long-term lie. However, the method of intervention was indirect and possibly invasive, especially without clear evidence. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned but poorly executed.\n\nThen there's the social fallout. Person A is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, which is tough. But if the marriage was based on deceit, maybe the breakup was inevitable. The question is whether the author is morally responsible for that outcome based on their suggestion.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if Person A acted with good intentions but the outcome was harmful, does that make them wrong? Or is the fault on Annie for her actions? It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely at fault because they didn't know for sure, but suggesting a paternity test based on suspicion could be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer might be B (No), because the author's intention was to help uncover the truth, even if the method was questionable. However, others might argue it's A (Yes) because they interfered without proof. But given the context, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
