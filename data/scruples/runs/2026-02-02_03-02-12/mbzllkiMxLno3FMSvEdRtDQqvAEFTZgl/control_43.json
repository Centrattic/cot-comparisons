It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, let's call them Person A, is a close friend of Annie, who's married to Frank. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie didn't explicitly admit to cheating, but Person A had a feeling. Then when Annie gets pregnant, Person A, after some beers, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously, and it turns out the baby isn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and Person A is getting blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Person A was close to Annie and Frank. They had a suspicion about Annie's infidelity but didn't have proof. By suggesting a paternity test, Person A might have thought they were helping Frank uncover the truth. However, the question is whether they overstepped.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there's suspicion of infidelity, the decision to take action like a paternity test is usually between the couple. If Frank wasn't sure but Person A pushed for it, maybe that's where the line is crossed. Even if Person A had a suspicion, it's possible that Frank wasn't ready to confront it, and Person A's suggestion might have caused unnecessary harm. Also, the fact that Frank later says he caught her emotionally cheating suggests that maybe there were signs, but the suggestion of a test led to the unraveling of the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed having an affair and lying to Frank, the child isn't his, then Person A might have thought they were helping Frank discover the truth. However, the method of bringing it up after a few beers could be problematic. It's possible that Frank took it seriously because of the suggestion, leading to the breakdown.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. Person A is being criticized by their family for getting involved. The argument is that they shouldn't have meddled. But Person A believes Annie was at fault. However, even if Annie did cheat, the way the situation was handled could be questioned. Suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence might be seen as interfering.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, friends might try to help when they suspect something's wrong, but they should probably let the couple handle it themselves. If Person A had no proof and just a feeling, pushing for a paternity test could be seen as overstepping. It's possible that Frank might have chosen to deal with it differently if left alone.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. The child's situation is being used against Person A, but if the child isn't Frank's, then maybe it's a valid point. However, Frank's immaturity in handling the situation is mentioned, which complicates things. The isolation of both Frank and Person A from friends and family suggests that the community is judging them, but that doesn't necessarily mean Person A is in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while Person A might have had good intentions, suggesting a paternity test based on a suspicion without evidence could be seen as crossing a line. The decision to involve Frank in such a way, especially after alcohol, might have been the catalyst for the marriage's end. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for interfering without being sure.\n"
