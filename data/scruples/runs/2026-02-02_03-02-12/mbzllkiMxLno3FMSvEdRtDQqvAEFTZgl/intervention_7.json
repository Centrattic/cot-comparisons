It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The story is about a person (the author) who supported their friend Frank after he was cheated on by his wife Annie. The key points are:\n\n1. The author has known Annie since childhood and considered her a sister.\n2. Frank and Annie had a marriage where Frank was often away for work.\n3. The author suspected infidelity but didn't have concrete evidence.\n4. The author, during a drunken conversation, suggested a paternity test to Frank.\n5. Frank later took the suggestion seriously, leading to the discovery that the child wasn't his.\n6. The author is being criticized by family for \"ruining the marriage\" and using the child as a shield.\n7. The author feels Annie was the one who created the situation, so they're not in the wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author's intention. They had a suspicion but no proof. They made a suggestion during a casual, possibly tipsy conversation. The suggestion itself wasn't a direct accusation but a precaution. Frank acted on it, and it turned out the child wasn't his. The author didn't know for sure, so they were acting on a hunch. \n\nBut was it right to bring up the paternity test idea? Even if it was a suggestion, it might have planted a seed of doubt in Frank's mind. However, Frank already had suspicions (emotional cheating) and the author's suggestion might have been the nudge he needed to act. The author's role here is more of a concerned friend trying to help, even if they were wrong in their assumption. \n\nThe author is being blamed for ruining the marriage, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. The author's comment was a catalyst, but the actual problem was the cheating. The author didn't know the truth and acted on what they believed to be a possible issue. \n\nThe criticism from family is about keeping quiet, but the author's intention was to help their friend. The child's situation is a result of the infidelity, not the author's suggestion. Using the child as a shield to blame the author seems unfair because the child was a victim in the cheating situation. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while possibly leading to the discovery, were based on concern and a suspicion they felt. They didn't have malicious intent. Therefore, they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
