It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. \n\nThe story is about Frank and Annie. The author is close to Annie, almost like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, there's no direct evidence given that Annie cheated, but the author sensed something. Then there's a baby on the way, and the author, after some drinks, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously and gets one, which confirms the baby isn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and their home, moving back with her parents. The author is getting blamed by family for causing the marriage breakdown and is feeling isolated.\n\nFirst, the author's action was suggesting a paternity test during a conversation after drinking. The key points here are the context of the suggestion. The author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. But the question is, was the suggestion to test justified? The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but maybe others would argue differently.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping Frank uncover the truth, especially since there were suspicions. If Annie was cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then Frank has a right to know. The author might have felt that the test was a way to confirm the suspicions that were already there. It's possible that the author believed they were doing the right thing by encouraging Frank to seek the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped. Even if there were suspicions, the author might not have the right to push Frank into a paternity test. The fact that it was suggested during a drunken conversation complicates things. Maybe Frank was already considering it, or maybe the author's comment planted the idea. But since Frank later took action, maybe the author's suggestion was just the catalyst. However, the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, which is a point to consider.\n\nAnnie's actions are clearly at the center of the problem here. She had an affair and had a child with someone else, which is a major betrayal. The author's role is more about facilitating the discovery of that betrayal. Even though the author didn't cause the cheating, their suggestion led to the breakup. But is that their fault? It's possible that without the test, Frank might have continued the marriage unaware, but that's not a good outcome either. The child isn't Frank's, so he's being honest about his feelings, and Annie is left in a difficult position.\n\nThe family's criticism of the author is about keeping quiet and not ruining the marriage. However, the author might argue that they were trying to help Frank get to the truth. The question is whether the author's action was justified given the circumstances. Since there were suspicions and the test confirmed them, maybe the author was right to encourage it. But the method (after drinks and perhaps impulsively) might be questioned.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes people feel the need to confront issues they suspect. However, the author isn't in a position to act as a detective. They might have acted on a hunch without concrete evidence. However, in a situation where a spouse is suspected of infidelity, sometimes friends do step in. The line is between being a concerned friend and overstepping.\n\nThe author's family is blaming them for the child situation, but the real issue is Annie's actions. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which is a natural consequence. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank uncover the betrayal, even if it had unintended consequences. The main responsibility lies with Annie for the cheating.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author suggested a paternity test based on their suspicions, which turned out to be correct. While the method might be debatable, the outcome was that the truth came out, which is important. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
