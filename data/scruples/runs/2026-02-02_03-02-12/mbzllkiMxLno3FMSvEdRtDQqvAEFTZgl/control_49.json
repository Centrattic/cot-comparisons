It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who suggested a paternity test is in the wrong. The story is about Frank and Annie. Frank is in the oil industry with a schedule that keeps him away for two weeks on and two off. The author, who's close to Annie, had a feeling she was cheating but couldn't do much because they live far apart. Then when Annie gets pregnant, the author, after some drinks, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously, does the test, finds out the kid isn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting blamed by family.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't have direct evidence of cheating, just a feeling. They made a suggestion in a casual setting (after beers), which Frank acted upon. The suggestion led to the breakup, which caused Annie to lose her financial stability. The author's family is upset, saying they should have kept quiet. On the other hand, the author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, did the author have a right to intervene? Since they're close friends, maybe they felt responsible. But does that justify making a suggestion that could have such serious consequences? The author didn't have concrete proof, just suspicion. Maybe they overstepped by bringing it up. However, Frank did the test himself, so he's responsible for acting on the suggestion. The author's intention might have been to help Frank, but without evidence, it's a risky move. \n\nThen, the aftermath: Annie is now in a worse position. Is the author's suggestion the main cause? Frank might have discovered the infidelity on his own eventually. The author's role was to plant the idea. If Frank didn't act on it, the situation might have stayed the same. But since he did, the author's comment was a catalyst. However, the responsibility for acting on it lies with Frank. \n\nThe author's family is blaming them, but maybe they're overreacting. The author's intention was to help a friend, albeit without evidence. The line between helping and meddling can be thin. In some cultures, friends might step in, but without proof, it's risky. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be wrong because Annie was cheating, and the author was trying to uncover the truth. But the method was flawed. Maybe the author should have encouraged Frank to confront Annie directly instead of suggesting a paternity test. But again, without evidence, that's hard. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't the one who cheated. The real issue is Annie's infidelity. The author's action was a suggestion that led to consequences, but they didn't force Frank's hand. However, in a situation where there's no proof, making such a suggestion could be seen as meddling. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had good intentions but acted on a suspicion without evidence. The outcome was negative, but the root cause was Annie's actions. The author's suggestion was a trigger, but Frank's decision to act on it is his own responsibility. Therefore, the author might not be entirely at fault, but they did overstep by bringing up the paternity test without evidence. However, given the close relationship, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author wasn't directly responsible for the cheating. They tried to help a friend, albeit in a way that had unintended consequences. The main wrongdoer is Annie. The author's role was a suggestion, which is a gray area but not entirely their fault.\n"
