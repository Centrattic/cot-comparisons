It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's best friend since childhood is Annie, who married Frank. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on and 14-day off schedule. During their 3-year marriage, Annie never openly admitted to cheating, but the author suspected it. The author, after visiting and having a few beers, suggested Frank might consider a paternity test to be sure. Frank ended up getting the test, which revealed the child wasn't his. The author's comment came back to haunt them as Annie lost her husband's financial support and is now struggling, while the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's actions: They suspected infidelity, suggested a paternity test. Frank acted on it, leading to the discovery. The author did not know for sure that Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. The test confirmed the child wasn't Frank's, which means Annie was unfaithful.\n\nIs the author responsible for the fallout? The author's suggestion led to Frank getting the test, which exposed the infidelity. But does that make the author at fault? Well, the author didn't have concrete evidence. They might have felt uncomfortable about the situation and wanted Frank to check. But in doing so, they might have acted on suspicion without proof.\n\nHowever, is there an obligation for the author to keep quiet? If the author had no proof, but just a feeling, suggesting a test could be seen as a way to help Frank uncover the truth. But maybe the author shouldn't have brought it up, considering the potential consequences. Frank has the right to know if the child isn't his, so encouraging a paternity test isn't inherently wrong. However, the author might have been a bit rash in bringing it up after drinking, which could have been careless.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was the one who committed emotional and physical infidelity, leading to the divorce. The author's role was to voice a suspicion, which led to the truth being revealed. So, the main wrongdoer is Annie, not the author. The author is being blamed for the fallout, but they were trying to help Frank, albeit in a possibly insensate way.\n\nBut was the author overstepping? Maybe. They might not have known all the details, and their suggestion could have been based on a feeling rather than facts. However, Frank did take the suggestion seriously and acted on it, which led to the truth. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions or the consequences of the divorce. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong here because they were trying to help a friend (Frank) uncover the truth about his marriage. However, the way they approached it might have been inconsiderate, especially given the closeness to Annie.\n\nBut in terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't the one who cheated. The real issue is Annie's infidelity. The author's suggestion was a catalyst, but they weren't the one who caused the initial betrayal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, so the answer would be B (No).\n"
