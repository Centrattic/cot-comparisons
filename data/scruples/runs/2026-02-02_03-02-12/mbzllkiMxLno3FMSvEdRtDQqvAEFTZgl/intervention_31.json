It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on, based on the story provided.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is friends with Annie, who's married to Frank. The author suspects Annie is cheating but can't do much from afar. When Frank finds out the baby isn't his, he gets a paternity test, which the author's suggestion prompted. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author stands by their decision, thinking Annie was at fault.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The author's comment came after drinking, but it led Frank to get a paternity test. Was the author justified in suggesting it? The user thinks the author isn't wrong, so I should evaluate that.\n\nAnnie's actions (emotional cheating and having a child with someone else) are clearly wrong. The author, as a close friend, might have felt compelled to act. However, the author's approach was indirect\u2014just a suggestion after alcohol, not confronting Annie directly. But maybe the author should have handled it differently, like talking to Frank more seriously or supporting him without pushing for the test.\n\nFrank's immaturity is mentioned. Maybe the author's role here is complicated because they both supported Frank's decision but also caused tension in their family. The author's family is upset, thinking they shouldn't have meddled. But the author believes Annie is responsible, which seems valid.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might not be wrong because they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the method (suggesting a paternity test indirectly) could be seen as overstepping, especially if it wasn't confirmed. It's a gray area. But given Annie's actions, the author's intent was to help Frank, so the answer leans towards B (not wrong).\n"
