It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend (Annie) who is married to Frank, and the author (let's call them \"the friend\") suspects Annie is cheating. The friend suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank finding out the baby isn't his. Now, the friend is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend had a suspicion based on a long-term relationship with Annie but no concrete evidence. They brought up the idea of a paternity test during a casual conversation. Frank later acted on that suggestion, leading to the discovery. The friend's family is upset because they think the friend should have stayed silent, and they're using the child as a reason to criticize them. The friend feels Annie created the situation and that the child card is unfair.\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Intention: The friend was concerned about their friend Annie and wanted to help Frank. But was the suggestion of a paternity test justified? Without direct evidence, bringing up such a serious accusation could be seen as crossing a line. However, the friend wasn't the one who cheated; they were just the catalyst for the test. Frank made the decision to get the test based on the friend's suggestion. So the friend's role was to voice a concern, which might have been valid, but perhaps not the best way to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a long-standing relationship with both Annie and Frank, and their concern wasn't out of malice. The result was that the truth came out, which could be seen as the right thing to do, even if it caused harm. The friend's family is upset, but the friend is standing by their decision because they believe Annie was the one who caused the situation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often focus on intent and the impact. The friend's intent was to help, but the impact led to the breakdown of the marriage. However, the real wrongdoing was Annie's infidelity and emotional cheating. The friend's role was minor in comparison. The family might not see it that way, but ethically, the friend might not be in the wrong because they didn't commit the infidelity. They just brought up a suggestion that Frank chose to act on. \n\nBut maybe the friend overstepped by suggesting the test without more concrete evidence. However, given the context of a close relationship and concern, it's a judgment call. Typically, in such cases, the person who committed the infidelity is at fault, not the one who exposed it. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
