It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them \"the narrator\") is a close friend of Annie who later discovers she was cheating on Frank. The key points are:\n\nThe narrator has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank works in a job with a long on/off schedule, and during their three-year marriage, Annie never openly admitted to cheating. The narrator, upon visiting, suggests a paternity test after some drinks, which leads Frank to confront Annie and discover the affair. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the narrator is facing criticism from their family for \"ruining the marriage.\"\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the narrator didn't have direct evidence of the cheating. They had a feeling but couldn't act on it due to distance. Suggesting a paternity test was a way to confirm their suspicion. Even though it was a casual comment during drinking, the narrator's intention was to ensure the kid was Frank's. The test confirmed the affair, which led to the breakup.\n\nAnnie's actions are clearly unethical, but the narrator's role is more complex. They might have acted out of concern for Frank, but the timing and method could be questioned. However, since the narrator was close to both Frank and Annie, they might have felt responsible to act. The main criticism is that the narrator's suggestion caused the breakup, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. \n\nThe narrator isn't directly involved in the affair, and they weren't malicious. They tried to help Frank uncover the truth. The blame here seems more on Annie. The family's criticism of the narrator for \"ruining the marriage\" is misplaced because the marriage was already unstable due to Annie's actions. The narrator's suggestion was a catalyst for exposing the problem, not creating it. \n\nTherefore, the narrator isn't in the wrong. Their actions were well-intentioned, even if the outcome was painful. So the answer should be B.\n"
