It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their sister figure, Annie, who is married to Frank. The author (let's call them the narrator) has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sibling. Frank is in the oil industry with a work schedule that's 14 days on, 14 off. Over three years, the narrator felt something was off, maybe that Annie was cheating, but they couldn't do much because they live far away.\n\nThen Annie gets pregnant, and the narrator, after some drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes the suggestion seriously and gets a test, which reveals the baby isn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The narrator is being criticized by their family for causing the marriage to fall apart, using the child as a reason. The narrator feels Annie was the one who created the situation and that the \"child card\" is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the narrator did something wrong. The key points here are: Did the narrator overstep by suggesting a paternity test? Was there any justification for that suggestion? The narrator mentions a \"feeling\" they had but doesn't provide concrete evidence. Frank later admits Annie was emotionally cheating, which might support the narrator's suspicion. But the suggestion came from the narrator in a casual setting after drinking. Was that an appropriate thing to do?\n\nIn many relationships, trust is crucial. If the narrator didn't have evidence but only a suspicion, bringing it up in a half-joking way after drinking could be seen as interfering. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, then maybe the narrator had a right to be concerned, especially if it's affecting the family. But the method of confronting the issue might be problematic. The narrator isn't in a position to advise Frank directly; they might have a close relationship, but it's not their place to meddle.\n\nFrank, on the other hand, might have been in denial about the cheating. The fact that he later acted on the suggestion suggests he had doubts too. But the narrator's role here is more of a friend. Friends sometimes feel they need to speak up if they suspect something wrong, but without evidence, it's risky. The consequences are severe: the marriage ends, Annie's life is upended, and the narrator is blamed.\n\nThe narrator's family is upset because they think they ruined the marriage. The narrator is standing by their belief that Annie was at fault. But the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. If the suggestion was based on a suspicion without proof, then maybe they did overstep. However, if they genuinely believed Annie was cheating and wanted Frank to know the truth, even if it led to a painful outcome, that could be seen as supporting Frank's right to know. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The narrator might not be entirely at fault if there was a valid reason to suspect infidelity, but the way they approached it could be problematic. However, the article is about whether the narrator is in the wrong. If the suggestion led directly to the paternity test and subsequent breakup, and if there was no solid evidence, then the narrator's role could be seen as contributing to a bad outcome. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, then the truth coming out was necessary, even if the narrator's method was flawed.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a gray area. The narrator might not be entirely at fault because the core issue was Annie's infidelity. However, their intervention might have accelerated the breakdown. Still, if Frank was already considering the possibility, the test was just the catalyst. So perhaps the narrator isn't in the wrong. But if there was no evidence, then maybe they shouldn't have intervened. \n\nGiven the information, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because the real issue was Annie's actions. The narrator tried to help Frank uncover the truth, which, while perhaps done in a not ideal way, was in response to a cheating spouse. So the main fault lies with Annie, not the narrator.\n"
