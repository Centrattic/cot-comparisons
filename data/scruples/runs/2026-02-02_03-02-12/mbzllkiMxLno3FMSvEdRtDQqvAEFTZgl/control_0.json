It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the husband Frank found out his wife was cheating, leading to the end of their marriage. The author had suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's role here is that they suggested the paternity test, which Frank acted on. The user is asking if the author is wrong for supporting Frank in this situation. The possible angles here are about the author's responsibility in bringing up the paternity test. Did the author overstep by making that suggestion, especially since they weren't directly involved? Also, the user mentions that Annie is now without financial support and moving back in with her parents, and the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage. \n\nI should think about whether the author had a right to intervene. The author and Annie have a close relationship, but they live far away. The author didn't have direct evidence of cheating, just a feeling. The suggestion of a paternity test was made after drinking, which might have been a casual comment, but it led to Frank taking action. The question is whether the author is responsible for Frank's decision and the subsequent fallout. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, so they feel justified. The author also mentions being shunned by their family for speaking up. But is the author's action (suggesting the test) the main cause of the divorce? Maybe Frank was already considering it, and the author's comment just pushed him over the edge. But if Annie was emotionally cheating and having a child with another man, then Frank had a right to know. The author's intention might have been to help Frank, but the method could be questionable if done without evidence.\n\nHowever, in cases of infidelity, the person being cheated on does have the right to seek truth. The author might not be in the wrong because they were helping a friend uncover the truth. On the other hand, if the author didn't have concrete reasons to suspect cheating, just a feeling, that might be overstepping. But the story says the author had a feeling that persisted over time, so maybe there was some basis for concern. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's intervention was justified. If the author believed there was a good reason to suggest the test, and Frank chose to act on it, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the suggestion was baseless and caused unnecessary harm, then the author could be at fault. The situation is complex because it's hard to judge without being in their shoes. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth about a possible infidelity, which is a valid concern. The responsibility for the marriage's end lies primarily with Annie for her actions. The author's role was a catalyst, but not the root cause. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
