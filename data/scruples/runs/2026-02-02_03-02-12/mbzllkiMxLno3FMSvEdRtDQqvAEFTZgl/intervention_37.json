It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe story is about Frank and Annie. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected that Annie was cheating because Frank was in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. After the baby was announced, the author, during a drunk conversation, suggested a paternity test. That led Frank to get a test, which proved the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and their home, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was at fault and is sticking by their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's role was bringing up the idea of a paternity test, which led to the discovery. But was the author justified in doing that? Let's consider the context. The author had been feeling for three years that Annie might be cheating but didn't have concrete proof. The author was close to both Annie and Frank, acting as a friend to both. The suggestion of a paternity test came after drinking, which might make the author question if it was a responsible thing to say. But the author's intention was to ensure Frank's paternity, perhaps out of concern that he wasn't the father.\n\nAnnie had been emotionally cheating, according to Frank. Emotional cheating can be a form of infidelity, but it's not the same as physical cheating. However, the paternity test showed the baby wasn't Frank's, which means Annie was unfaithful in a physical way as well. The author's action led to the truth coming out, which ended the marriage but exposed the infidelity.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong for suggesting the test? The author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. But Annie was the one who cheated. If the author had not suggested the test, the truth might have stayed hidden, and Frank would have continued being cheated on. But the author's role was to be a friend to both. However, since they were closer to Annie, maybe there's a conflict of interest.\n\nBut in this case, the author's action revealed the betrayal. If Annie was indeed cheating, then perhaps the author's action was justified. However, the method might be questionable. The author didn't have direct evidence and was acting on a feeling. Even though the suggestion was made in a casual setting (after drinks), it still led to the test that exposed the infidelity. The author might have overstepped by bringing it up without proof, but their intention was to help Frank uncover the truth.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not have known the full story. Maybe Annie had a valid reason for the baby not being Frank's, but that's unlikely given the outcome. Since the paternity test confirmed the baby wasn't Frank's, it's clear there was infidelity. So the author's action led to Frank realizing he was cheated on, which is the right outcome, even if it caused a rift.\n\nBut the author's family is judging them. However, the author's actions were based on a suspicion that was valid (since Annie was cheating). The author isn't directly responsible for the cheating; they just helped expose it. So the blame should be on Annie, not the author.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
