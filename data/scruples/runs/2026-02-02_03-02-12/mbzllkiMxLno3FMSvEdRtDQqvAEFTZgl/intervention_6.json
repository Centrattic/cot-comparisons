It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation is that the author, let's call them Alex, has been friends with Annie since childhood. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a schedule that makes him away for two weeks at a time. Over three years, there were hints that Annie might be cheating, but nothing direct. Then when Annie gets pregnant, Alex suggests a paternity test during a drunk conversation. Frank later takes the test, which shows the baby isn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. Alex is getting flak from family for \"ruining the marriage\" and is standing by their belief that Annie created the situation.\n\nSo the main question is whether Alex did something wrong by suggesting the paternity test. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, did Alex have a right to question the situation? Since they've known Annie for a long time, maybe they felt close enough to be concerned. The problem is that the test was suggested when Alex was drunk. That might have made the comment less measured. Also, Alex might not have known for sure that Annie was cheating, just a feeling. But even with a feeling, is it Alex's place to intervene?\n\nThen there's the outcome. The test confirmed the baby wasn't Frank's, so Annie was unfaithful. But the question is whether Alex's action was justified. On one hand, Frank found out the truth, which he might not have otherwise. On the other hand, Alex's suggestion might have caused unnecessary harm. Was it right to push for the test when there was no concrete evidence? Or is it better that the truth came out, even if it was painful?\n\nAlso, the fact that Frank waited until after the test to leave Annie might be influenced by Alex's suggestion. But Annie was the one who was cheating, so maybe the marriage was already problematic. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is in a situation where they suspect infidelity, it's often hard to know what to do. Alex might have felt they were helping a friend (Frank) by ensuring the baby was his. However, intervening in a private matter without being certain could be seen as overstepping. The key factors are whether Alex had the right to suggest the test, and whether the method (mentioning it while drunk) was appropriate.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child. Some might argue that the child shouldn't be used as a pawn, but in this case, the test was about paternity, which is a valid concern for Frank. Annie's actions led to the situation, so maybe the blame lies more with her.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method of suggestion might have been hasty, the intention was to uncover the truth. Since Annie was indeed unfaithful, the outcome might be seen as just. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
