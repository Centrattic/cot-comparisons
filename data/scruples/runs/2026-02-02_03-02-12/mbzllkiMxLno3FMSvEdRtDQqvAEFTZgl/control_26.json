It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author, let's call them Alex, has a close relationship with Annie, who's like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in oil with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years, Alex suspected Annie might be cheating but didn't have proof. When Annie got pregnant, Alex, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and moving back home. Alex is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and both Alex and Frank are isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if Alex did the right thing. The key points are: Alex's suspicion was based on a feeling, not evidence. They mentioned the paternity test idea while drunk, which Frank acted on. The consequences are severe for all parties. \n\nOn one hand, Alex might think they were helping Frank by addressing the cheating. But without concrete evidence, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as causing harm. Cheating is a serious issue, but emotional cheating might not be the same as physical infidelity. Also, the child is involved now, which complicates things. Alex's family is criticizing them for not staying silent, which adds to the conflict.\n\nEthically, is it Alex's responsibility to intervene? Since they're close to both Frank and Annie, maybe they felt it was their role. But without proof, even if the suspicion was there, bringing up the suggestion led to the breakdown. The author might argue that Annie was at fault for cheating, but the method of confronting it was flawed.\n\nThe question is about whether Alex is in the wrong. The main factors are intent, knowledge of evidence, and the outcome. Alex acted on a suspicion, not proof, which could be seen as overstepping. The impact on the family and the child makes it a heavy decision. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe there was a justification. But since the author didn't have proof, it's possible they are at fault for causing unnecessary harm. Alternatively, if Frank was being a good husband and the child isn't his, maybe Alex's intervention was necessary. But the way it was done, especially under the influence, might be problematic. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe the blame isn't solely on Alex. Frank and Annie's relationship issues are between them. But Alex's role was to suggest a test that led to the revelation. So depending on the perspective, the answer could swing either way. However, traditionally, in such situations, people might side with keeping personal matters private unless there's clear evidence. Since Alex's suggestion was based on a feeling and not facts, they might be seen as overreaching. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong). But there's also the argument that if Annie was cheating, Alex was trying to help. It's a tough call. But given the lack of evidence and the consequences, perhaps A is more appropriate.\n"
