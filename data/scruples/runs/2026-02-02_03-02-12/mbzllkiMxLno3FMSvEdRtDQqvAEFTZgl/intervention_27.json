It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend of Annie's, almost like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author noticed that Annie might be cheating, but since they live 1000 km apart, they couldn't do much. Then when they found out they were expecting a baby, the author, after a few beers, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. That comment stuck with Frank, leading him to push for a paternity test, which confirmed the child wasn't his. Now, the author is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and both they and Frank are isolated from friends and family.\n\nFirst, the key points here are intent and responsibility. The author's main action was suggesting a paternity test to Frank. But was that a justified action? The author had a feeling that Annie was cheating, but there was no direct evidence. By suggesting the test, the author might have been trying to help Frank uncover the truth, even if it led to a painful outcome. However, the author's role in this is a bit ambiguous. They were a close friend of Annie's, but they were also concerned about the situation. \n\nNext, the consequences: the marriage ended because of the infidelity, and the author was the catalyst by planting the idea. But was the author at fault for speaking the truth? If Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author was doing the right thing. However, the author didn't have concrete proof, just a feeling. That could mean they acted on a suspicion without proper evidence, which might be seen as meddling. But given that the author trusted their intuition based on a long friendship with Annie, maybe they thought they were helping Frank protect himself.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intentions. Were they trying to help Frank or were they biased against Annie? The author mentions that Annie is more like a sister to them, which might mean they have a closer emotional bond. Could that cloud their judgment? If they suspected Annie was cheating, maybe they were trying to protect Frank, but given their close relationship with Annie, perhaps they were also looking out for Frank's interests. It's a complex situation where the author's loyalty to both Frank and Annie is tested.\n\nAlso, considering that Frank was the one who actually pushed for the paternity test after the author's suggestion, the author might not be entirely responsible for the outcome. The decision to take the test was Frank's, even if the idea came from the author. So maybe the author's role was just the catalyst, not the direct cause. However, the family is blaming the author, thinking they shouldn't have intervened. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to suggest a paternity test if you suspect infidelity? If the person you're telling is the spouse, then maybe it's their right to know. But the author didn't have evidence, just a feeling. That could be seen as irresponsible. On the other hand, if the author knew something and kept quiet, that might be worse. The line between helping and overstepping is thin here.\n\nThe aftermath shows that both the author and Frank are isolated. The family thinks the author is at fault. The author's defense is that Annie created the situation, which is true, but the author's action led to the exposure of the infidelity. So, while the root cause is Annie's cheating, the author's role in revealing it might be seen as the trigger for the breakup. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was based on suspicion without evidence, but their intent was to help Frank uncover the truth. The outcome was painful, but the responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie. However, by suggesting the test, the author might have overstepped, even if with good intentions. But since the family is criticizing them for speaking up, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to prevent Frank from being deceived. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
