It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person (the author) who suggested a paternity test to their friend Frank, which led to the discovery that Frank's wife Annie had cheated and the baby isn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood and is like a sister. They noticed something was off but couldn't do much from afar. The author suggested a paternity test after drinking, which Frank acted on, leading to the breakup. The author's family is upset that they didn't stay silent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong by suggesting the test. On one hand, the author had concerns about the marriage and the baby's paternity, which turned out to be correct. The suggestion led to uncovering the infidelity and the child not being Frank's. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by bringing it up, even if it was true. But if the author had stayed silent, Frank might have continued being deceived, which could have lasting effects.\n\nEthically, if someone has a suspicion that a close friend is being cheated on, is it their responsibility to act? The author's intention was to help Frank protect himself, even if it caused immediate harm. However, the method of bringing it up after drinking might not have been the best, but the content of the suggestion was valid. \n\nAlso, the author isn't directly involved in the infidelity or the cheating; they were just a concerned friend. The blame seems misplaced on the author, as the responsibility for the cheating lies with Annie. The author acted on a hunch and it turned out to be correct, so maybe they are not at fault. The family criticism is about keeping silent, but sometimes speaking up can prevent further harm in the long run.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong."
