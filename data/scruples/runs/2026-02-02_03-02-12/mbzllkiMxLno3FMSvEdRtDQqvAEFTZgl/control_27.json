It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister-in-law, Annie, who was cheating on her husband Frank, who works in a job that requires him to be away for two weeks at a time. The author suspected something was off, especially when there was a baby on the way, and after some alcohol, suggested a paternity test. That led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his and that Annie had been emotionally cheating. Now, the author is being blamed by their family for causing the breakup and is isolated because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's role was to be a friend to both Frank and Annie. They noticed something was off and took action by suggesting a paternity test. But was that the right move? Well, if it's true that Annie was cheating and the baby isn't Frank's, then the author's suspicion might have been valid. However, the method of bringing it up\u2014after a few beers\u2014might not have been the best approach. It's possible that the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling, which led to Frank taking drastic action. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have been trying to protect Frank from being deceived, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, inserting oneself into someone else's relationship can be problematic, especially without direct evidence. The author's suggestion could have been seen as intrusive or accusatory, especially since they weren't in a position to know the full story. \n\nAlso, the fact that Annie is now facing financial difficulties and moving back in with her parents adds another layer. The author's family is blaming them for ruining a good marriage, which is a common reaction in such situations. However, the author believes that Annie was the one at fault for cheating, so they feel justified. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author had a suspicion, suggesting a paternity test in a casual, alcohol-fueled conversation might not have been the most responsible way to handle it. Frank's decision to pursue a test based on that suggestion led to the revelation of the cheating. However, the author isn't the one who cheated; they were just the catalyst for Frank finding out. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend. However, they might have overstepped by not having a more private, serious conversation with Frank, or perhaps by not ensuring that Frank had enough evidence before acting. The key here is whether the author acted with malicious intent or not. Since the author's intention was to protect Frank, even if the method was flawed, they might not be entirely at fault. \n\nBut there's also the question of whether the author had the right to meddle in Frank and Annie's relationship. Since the author is close to Annie and Frank, their actions might have been influenced by personal feelings. However, the primary issue is the cheating itself. If Annie was indeed cheating, then Frank's decision to leave is understandable, and the author's role was to support Frank, which they did. \n\nIn conclusion, while the way the author approached the situation might not have been perfect, the core issue is Annie's infidelity and emotional cheating. The author isn't the wrongdoer here; they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth, even if their method was questionable. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
