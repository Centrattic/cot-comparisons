It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend's sister, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author, let's call them Alex, found out that Annie was being unfaithful and suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery that the baby wasn't his. Now, people are blaming Alex for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Alex has known Annie since childhood, almost like a sister. Frank was away a lot for work. Alex suspected something but didn't have proof. Then, after some drinks, Alex brought up the idea of a paternity test. That led Frank to get one, which confirmed his suspicions. Now, Annie is left without financial support and is moving back in with her parents. Alex is being criticized by their family for speaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did Alex have a right to bring up the paternity test? Was there any indication that Annie was cheating? The story says Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but it was more of a feeling Alex had. However, there was emotional cheating, which Frank caught on to. The paternity test confirmed the baby wasn't his. \n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, if Alex had a suspicion based on some evidence or behavior, is it their responsibility to speak up? Or is it meddling in someone else's business? On one hand, Alex might think they're helping Frank uncover the truth. On the other hand, maybe they overstepped by suggesting the test, especially if they weren't entirely sure. \n\nBut wait, Frank did end up getting the test because of Alex's suggestion, which led to the truth. However, the child's paternity is now a sensitive issue. Some might argue that Alex shouldn't have interfered because it's not their place. Others might say that if they knew about the infidelity, they had a duty to let Frank know to protect him from being deceived.\n\nAlso, the fact that Annie is now in a difficult situation\u2014without a home or income\u2014could be seen as a consequence of the paternity test. But if she cheated and had a child with someone else, maybe she was the one who created the problem in the first place. \n\nThe family is blaming Alex for ruining the marriage. But if the marriage was already broken because of Annie's infidelity, then Frank's decision to leave might have been inevitable. Maybe Alex just brought to light what was already there. \n\nAnother angle: emotional cheating is a form of betrayal, even if there's no physical evidence. If Frank found out about the emotional cheating, that might have already been a reason for him to question the relationship. The paternity test just confirmed the child wasn't his, which is a major issue.\n\nSo, was Alex in the wrong? If Alex had no proof but just a feeling, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up. But if they had some reason to believe Annie was cheating, perhaps it was their duty to help Frank. It's a tricky situation. \n\nIn the end, the answer depends on whether Alex had a right to interfere. If the intent was to help Frank uncover the truth, then maybe not in the wrong. But if they were just spreading rumors without evidence, then yes. The story says that Frank later admitted to emotional cheating, so there was some basis for the suspicion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they helped Frank discover the truth that Annie had already created. The blame on Alex for ruining the marriage might be misplaced since the marriage was already compromised by Annie's actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
