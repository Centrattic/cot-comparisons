It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister figure Annie, her husband Frank, and an affair that led to a paternity issue. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's. Now they're being criticized by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank was in a marriage where Annie was cheating, both emotionally and physically. The author, after some drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, got the test done, and found out the child isn't his. Now Annie is struggling financially and moving back in with her parents. The author's family is blaming them for speaking up, saying they should've stayed silent. The author believes Annie was at fault and thinks using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the paternity test. To determine that, I need to consider if the author had a reasonable suspicion, whether they had the right to intervene, and if their actions were justified.\n\nThe author mentions that Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. However, the paternity test confirmed the child wasn't Frank's, which implies Annie was unfaithful. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which ended the marriage. \n\nBut was the author's intervention appropriate? The author wasn't in a position to know for sure, but they had a suspicion. By suggesting the test, they might have been trying to help Frank uncover the truth. However, bringing it up after drinking could be seen as careless. But the fact that the test revealed the truth shows there was a basis for the suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have meddled. But Annie was emotionally cheating, which is still cheating. The author might have felt responsible to do something, especially since they were close to both parties.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if Annie was cheating, then she's the one at fault. The author's role was to point out a possible issue, leading to the truth. Even though the method (suggesting a test while drunk) might not have been ideal, the outcome revealed a betrayal. The author isn't directly responsible for Annie's actions; they just brought to light what was already happening.\n\nThe people blaming the author are shifting responsibility from Annie to the author. The child's existence doesn't make the cheating okay, and using the child as an excuse might be a way for others to justify not holding Annie accountable. The author's stance that Annie created the situation is valid because she was the one who cheated.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their suggestion led to uncovering the truth, which is a positive outcome despite the messy aftermath. The blame should be on Annie for her infidelity, not the author for speaking up. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
