It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe story is about Frank and Annie. The author is Annie's best friend since childhood. Frank is in the oil industry with a work schedule that keeps him away for two weeks at a time. The author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because of the distance. When Frank's baby was born, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously and the test showed he wasn't the father. It's also mentioned that Frank caught her emotionally cheating. Now, the author is being criticized by family for causing the breakup, and both the author and Frank are isolated.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants confirmation. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author's intention: they had a feeling something was off and suggested a paternity test. But was that crossing a line? The author wasn't a party to the marriage, just a friend. The problem is that the author's comment led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. However, the author didn't have proof, just suspicion. \n\nAnnie was the one cheating, emotionally and possibly physically. The author's motivation might have been to help Frank, but the method of bringing up the paternity test after drinking might have been hasty. But the author wasn't pressuring Frank; it was Frank who decided to follow through. \n\nThe author isn't directly responsible for the cheating. The blame should fall on Annie for the infidelity. The author's role was to voice a suspicion, which Frank acted upon. However, the author's suggestion did lead to the breakup, so maybe there's some guilt there. But since Frank was already suspicious (he \"caught her emotional cheating\"), the test was his choice. \n\nThe author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, but the marriage was already flawed. The author's action was a catalyst but not the root cause. The real fault lies with Annie. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
