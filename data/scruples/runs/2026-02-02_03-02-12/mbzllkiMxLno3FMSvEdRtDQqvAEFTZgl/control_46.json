It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (we'll call them \"Me\") has a close friend Annie. Annie married Frank, who works in oil and is away for two weeks on and two off. For three years, Annie didn't openly admit to cheating, but there were hints. Then when they find out Annie is pregnant, the author, after some drinks, suggests Frank do a paternity test. That led to the test showing the kid isn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and Me is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The question is whether Me is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author didn't have direct evidence of cheating but had a feeling. They suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery. But was the suggestion justified? Well, if Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe the author thought there was a possibility of infidelity. But without concrete evidence, is it right to push for a paternity test? Paternity tests are a big deal, especially since they can affect the child and the family. However, if the author had a legitimate reason to suspect the child wasn't Frank's, maybe their concern was valid. But since the author was friends with Annie, maybe they should have been more cautious.\n\nWait, the author mentions that Annie was emotionally cheating. Emotional cheating can be a red flag, but it doesn't necessarily mean she was physically unfaithful. So Frank might have taken the emotional cheating as a sign to get the test, which he later did. The author's role was to suggest the test after a few beers. The problem is that the author might have acted on a suspicion without being certain. If they didn't have proof, maybe they shouldn't have encouraged the test. But if they were genuinely concerned for Frank's well-being, maybe it was justified.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. But the marriage was already in trouble if there was emotional cheating. The author might have been trying to protect Frank from being deceived. However, the author's suggestion led to the test, which caused the breakup. If the author didn't have proof, maybe they overstepped. But since they were close to both parties, maybe they felt responsible.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to bring up the suggestion. If they had no evidence, just a feeling, it's possible they acted irresponsibly. However, emotional cheating is a legitimate concern in a marriage. Frank had the right to know if the child wasn't his. The author's intention was to help Frank, but the method might have been flawed. By suggesting the test in a casual setting after drinking, maybe the author wasn't being cautious enough.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame because their suggestion led to the test. But ultimately, the decision to take the test was Frank's. The author's family is blaming them, but maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The main issue is that the suggestion came from a friend rather than Frank acting on his own observations. So the answer might be that the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe they should have handled it differently. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. However, since they acted on suspicion without proof and it led to the breakdown of the marriage, they might be partially at fault. But given the emotional cheating, maybe it's understandable. The answer could be B (No), because the author had a reason to be concerned and the ultimate decision was Frank's.\n"
