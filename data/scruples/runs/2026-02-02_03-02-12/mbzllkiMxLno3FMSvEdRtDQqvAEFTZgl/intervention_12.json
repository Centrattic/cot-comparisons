It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. Frank is in the oil industry, working 14 days on and 14 off. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected Annie was cheating because of a feeling but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then when the baby comes along, the author suggests a paternity test to Frank during a visit, after some beers. That suggestion leads Frank to get a test, which confirms the baby isn't his. Now the author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage and is being isolated.\n\nFirst, the author's intention. They thought Annie was being unfaithful and wanted Frank to be sure. But did they have proof? It was just a feeling. The author didn't know for sure, but still planted the idea. Even if it was a feeling, bringing up a paternity test is a big step. Maybe the author shouldn't have done that without more evidence. But on the other hand, if Annie was actually cheating, maybe the author was trying to help Frank avoid being a father to someone else's child.\n\nBut the problem here is how the author approached it. Suggesting a paternity test in a casual setting, especially after drinking, might not be the best way. It's possible that the author overstepped their boundaries. Since they're friends, maybe they had a right to be concerned, but the way they did it led to the marriage breaking down. Also, Frank might have taken it the wrong way, thinking the author was accusing him or Annie directly.\n\nThen there's the aftermath. The author is blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. But Annie was the one who cheated, so maybe the author is in the right for stopping Frank from being deceived. But the author's suggestion was the catalyst. Even if it was a feeling, causing someone to take a paternity test when there's no solid evidence could be seen as meddling. However, if the author didn't act, Frank might still be in the dark. It's a tough balance between helping a friend and respecting privacy.\n\nAnother angle: the author's relationship with Annie. If they're as close as they say, maybe they had a duty to speak up. But maybe they should have approached it differently, like talking to Annie first or giving Frank time to realize things on his own. The fact that the author didn't have concrete evidence makes it tricky. It's possible that the author acted out of concern but without the right approach.\n\nAlso, the child being used as a card. The author argues that Annie created the situation, so the child's involvement is more Annie's fault. But the child is innocent, and the author's suggestion led to the paternity test. Even if the author is right about the infidelity, dragging the child into the fallout could be seen as harsh. However, the child's well-being is important, so maybe Frank and Annie should have sorted it out without the author's interference.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether the author overstepped. They had a feeling, not proof, and their action led to a significant consequence. While the intention was to help Frank, the method might have been inappropriate. But considering the outcome, maybe it was necessary. It's a mix of right and wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they acted on a suspicion without evidence and caused a breakup, maybe they are partially at fault. But since Annie actually did cheat, the author's action was justified. Hmm, tricky.\n"
