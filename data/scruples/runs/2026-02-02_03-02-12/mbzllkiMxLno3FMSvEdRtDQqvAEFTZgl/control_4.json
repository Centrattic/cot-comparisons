It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author, who is the person supporting Frank and suggesting a paternity test, is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Annie married Frank, who is in a job that's away for two weeks on and two weeks off. The author sensed something might be wrong but didn't have proof. Then when there's a pregnancy, the author suggests a paternity test after a few beers. Frank later insists on the test, which reveals the child isn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is being criticized by family for causing the breakdown of the marriage and is isolated along with Frank.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Did the author overstep by suggesting the paternity test? Was the author justified in having suspicions? How much responsibility does the author have for the outcome?\n\nThe author didn't directly accuse Annie or confront her, just floated the idea to Frank. But Frank was already suspicious, as he later acted on the suggestion. The author might have felt that Frank needed to know the truth, maybe to prevent being cheated on financially or emotionally. However, the author's suggestion led to the paternity test, which caused the marriage to collapse. The author is now facing backlash for the consequences.\n\nBut wait, if Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then the author's concern was valid. However, the way they approached it might be questionable. The author was in a position where they felt compelled to help Frank, but they might have crossed a line by suggesting something that would unravel the marriage. The key is whether the author had the right to interfere in the first place.\n\nOn one hand, the author was protecting Frank from a potentially harmful situation. On the other hand, they might have meddled in a private matter without being directly asked. The fact that Frank acted on the suggestion and the marriage ended because of it raises the question of responsibility. However, the root cause was Annie's infidelity and the resulting deception. The author's suggestion was a catalyst, but the main issue was Annie's actions.\n\nThe author's family is blaming them, but maybe they're not considering that Annie's actions were the initial problem. The author could argue they were helping Frank discover the truth. However, the method of suggesting the test while drunk might not have been the best approach. Still, if the author's intention was to help, they might not be entirely at fault. The question is whether the author is responsible for the outcome. Since the author didn't know for sure and was just expressing a concern, it's debatable. But they did push for a test that led to the separation. So, maybe the author shares some blame for overstepping, but perhaps not the main blame.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (No), because the author's intention was to help Frank, and the main wrongdoer was Annie. However, the author's suggestion did play a role. But considering that the marriage was being deceptive, the author might not be entirely wrong. So, maybe B is the answer.\n"
