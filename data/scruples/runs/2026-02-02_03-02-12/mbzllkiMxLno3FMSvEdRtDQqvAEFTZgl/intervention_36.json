It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband by suggesting a paternity test. The situation is that Frank and Annie were married, and Frank suspected infidelity. The author, being close to both, mentioned the idea of a paternity test during a conversation after drinking. This led to Frank getting a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, both are facing fallout, and the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating but had a feeling. They made a suggestion in a casual setting (after beers). The test was Frank's idea, and he took the initiative. The author didn't directly accuse Annie but raised a question that led to the truth.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they didn't lie or intentionally sabotage. They acted on a suspicion they couldn't ignore. However, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as meddling. But since Frank acted on it and it turned out to be true, maybe the author was right to have that concern. The criticism from family might be harsh because the author was trying to help a friend. The main issue is whether it's wrong to support Frank after the fact, but the author's role was in initiating the test. \n\nBut wait, the author's suggestion was the catalyst. Even if they had good intentions, bringing up the idea might have been a breach of trust if they weren't sure. However, without the suggestion, Frank might never have found out. It's a tough call. On one hand, the author was trying to help a friend. On the other, they might have overstepped. But since the cheating was confirmed, maybe the author was justified. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), because the author wasn't in the wrong. They acted on a suspicion and their suggestion led to the truth, which, while painful, was necessary. The fault lies more with Annie for her infidelity than the author for trying to help.\n"
