It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the author (let's call them \"Me\").\n\nFirst, the key points: Frank and Annie were married for three years. Frank works in oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Annie was emotionally cheating, and the child isn't Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test while drunk, which led to Frank getting one, revealing the infidelity. Now, Annie is struggling financially and moving back in with her parents. The author is being criticized by family for causing the marriage breakdown, but they stand by their decision, thinking Annie was at fault.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for suggesting the paternity test?\n\nLet me break it down. The author was close to both Frank and Annie. They had a suspicion based on Annie's behavior but no proof. The author's comment, even if made after drinking, was a suggestion that led to the test. Without that suggestion, maybe Frank wouldn't have done the test. But the test revealed the truth, which ended the marriage.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to encourage someone to get a paternity test if you suspect infidelity? The author might have had good intentions, wanting to uncover the truth for Frank. However, the method of suggesting it during a drunken conversation might not be the best approach. Also, the author's close relationship with both parties complicates things. They were like a sister to Annie, but also a friend to Frank. \n\nBut here's the thing: the real issue is the infidelity. Annie was unfaithful, which is a major betrayal. The author's action led to the truth coming out, which might have been necessary for Frank to make an informed decision. However, the author's role is a catalyst here. They might not be responsible for the cheating itself, but their suggestion was the immediate trigger.\n\nSome might argue that the author overstepped by making the suggestion, especially since it led to the marriage ending. Others might say that the author was doing the right thing by helping Frank discover the truth, even if it was a harsh method. The family's criticism is based on the idea that the author caused unnecessary damage, but the underlying issue was Annie's actions.\n\nAlso, the child being used as a reason to criticize the author is a bit of a red herring. The child's existence is due to Annie's infidelity. The author isn't the parent here, so they might not be responsible for the child's well-being in this context. Frank's decision to leave might be seen as a reaction to being lied to, not just about the child's paternity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was a consequence of their suspicion and desire to help Frank. The main wrongdoer is Annie. The author's suggestion, while perhaps poorly timed or delivered, was based on a suspicion that turned out to be true. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
