It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Frank found out his wife was cheating, leading to a breakup and now Frank is moving away. The author, who's a close friend of Annie, suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the baby isn't Frank's. Now, the author is being blamed by family members for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has known Annie since they were kids and considers her a sister. Frank was married to Annie for three years, working in oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected something was off but didn't have proof. He brought up the paternity test idea after drinking, and Frank later insisted on getting one. The test revealed the child wasn't his, which the author says was emotional cheating, but maybe there was physical cheating too. Now, the author is being criticized for suggesting the test, and Frank is isolated, moving away.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical angles. Did the author have the right to suggest a paternity test? Well, the author was a close friend to both. But does that mean he should have stayed out of it? Maybe. However, if Annie was cheating, then Frank had the right to know. The author's suggestion might have been an attempt to protect Frank from being a non-biological father to someone else's child. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by pushing for the test, especially if there was no concrete evidence.\n\nThe story mentions that Annie never directly admitted to cheating; it was just a feeling the author had. So, the author acted on suspicion rather than proof. That could be problematic because making such a serious suggestion without evidence might have caused unnecessary harm. Frank and Annie's marriage ended because of this, and the author is now being blamed. The family is telling him to stay out of it, which adds to the conflict.\n\nBut then, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the author's suggestion led to Frank finding out the truth. Without the suggestion, Frank might have continued the marriage, raising someone else's child. That's a significant consequence. However, the author's role here is complicated. He's a friend to both, but his interference led to the breakup. The moral dilemma is whether the author had the right to intervene in that way.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely at fault because the core issue was Annie's infidelity. However, the method of intervention\u2014suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence\u2014might be where the author made a mistake. He should have perhaps encouraged Frank to address the suspicions directly with Annie before taking such a drastic step. Additionally, the author's relationship with Annie as a close friend might have clouded his judgment, leading him to act in a way that wasn't entirely neutral.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on Frank. The author's suggestion led to Frank's financial and social upheaval. Even though Annie's actions were wrong, the author's role in exposing the truth through a suggestion that might not have been necessary could be seen as harmful. However, if the author genuinely believed Frank was being cheated on and wanted to protect him from being a non-biological parent, that could be seen as a noble intent. The problem is the approach taken.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the key is whether the person did something wrong. The author didn't commit a crime or a direct betrayal, but their actions did contribute to the breakdown of the marriage. The question is whether suggesting the test was crossing a line. Since the author had a close relationship with both parties, maybe they should have stayed out of it unless there was more concrete evidence. Acting on suspicion alone might be where the mistake lies.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity. However, suggesting the test without stronger evidence could be seen as overstepping. In AITA terms, though, the answer often hinges on whether the person's actions were justified. Since the author's action led to a significant negative outcome without clear proof, some might argue they are at least partially at fault. However, others might say that protecting a friend from being cheated on is justified, even if it leads to unintended consequences.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong because the main fault lies with Annie for cheating. The author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. But the method was flawed. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could swing either way. However, in an AITA context, if the action was based on suspicion without proof, that's where the author could be considered at fault. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without evidence, leading to the marriage's end. Alternatively, if the action was justified to protect a friend from being deceived, then B (No) could be the answer.\n\nBut given that the author had no concrete evidence and acted on a feeling, which led to a breakdown, it's likely that the answer is A. The author overstepped by suggesting the test without proof, thus contributing to the marriage's collapse. So, the answer is A.\n"
