It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation involves Annie, who is believed to have cheated, and the author's suggestion that Frank do a paternity test led to the discovery that the baby isn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author knew Annie since childhood and had a close relationship. The author's sisterly bond with Annie might have influenced their judgment. The key point is that the author suggested a paternity test after a couple of beers, which Frank took seriously. The test confirmed the child wasn't his, leading to the marriage breakdown. \n\nAnnie never directly admitted to cheating, so the author's intuition about something being off might have been valid. However, without direct evidence, the author's intervention could be seen as overstepping. The user argues that Annie's actions created the situation, and the author is just exposing the truth. \n\nBut was it the author's place to push for a paternity test? Even if the author had suspicions, suggesting a test without concrete proof might be viewed as meddling. Frank could have made that decision independently. The fact that the author's suggestion led to the test complicates things. Also, the author is now being blamed by family for the fallout, which is a common reaction when relationships break down due to external input.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely believe they were helping Frank protect himself and the child. The user's stance is that the author is not wrong because Annie was the one who created the situation. However, the author's role in causing the conflict could make them partially responsible. The question is whether the author overstepped by making the suggestion, especially without being asked directly. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if Annie was indeed cheating and the author had a close enough relationship to care about Frank's well-being, maybe their intention was good. But the method of intervention\u2014suggestion during a drinking session\u2014might not be the best approach. It's a gray area. The answer could hinge on whether the author's actions were justified in protecting Frank's interests versus overstepping personal boundaries. Since the user is asking for a choice between A and B, and considering the nuances, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity, but there's a valid argument that the author shouldn't have pushed for the test. However, given that the author's intention was to help Frank, and Annie was the one who cheated, the answer might be B. But I need to be careful here. Another perspective is that the author's suggestion, though well-meaning, still played a role in the breakup, making them partly at fault. Hmm. It's tricky. But the user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong, so I should consider if that's justified. The key is whether the author had a right to intervene. If they were close to both and had a reason to suspect something, maybe it's understandable. So I think B is more accurate here.\n"
