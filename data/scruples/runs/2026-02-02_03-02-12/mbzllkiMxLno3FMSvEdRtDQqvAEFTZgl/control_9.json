It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where Annie was cheating. The author, who's close to Annie, suggested Frank do a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the baby isn't his. Now, Frank is upset, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the author's intent: They felt something was off and, after drinking, suggested the test. They might have thought they were helping Frank. But was that right? Well, suggesting a paternity test is a big deal. But if Annie was cheating, maybe it was inevitable that Frank would find out. However, the author isn't the one who caused the cheating. But by bringing up the test, the author accelerated the truth coming out. \n\nNow, the family is blaming the author. The question is whether the author is wrong. The main point is, does the author have a responsibility to stay out of other people's marriages? The author is a close friend, so maybe they felt compelled to act. But without concrete evidence, just a feeling, suggesting the test might have been premature. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, the author is helping Frank uncover the truth. \n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't have proof. They acted on suspicion. That could be seen as meddling. However, the author's role as a sister-like figure might justify their concern. On the other hand, the paternity test was a direct result of the author's suggestion, which led to the divorce and Annie's current situation. \n\nBut Annie was the one who cheated. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. The author's mistake might be in bringing it up without proof, but if the suspicion was valid, maybe they're not wrong. The key here is intent. The author wanted to help Frank, but their method might have been intrusive. However, without the author's suggestion, Frank might have stayed in an abusive situation longer. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author wasn't the one who cheated; they were trying to help Frank. The wrongdoer is Annie, not the author. The family is blaming the wrong person here. Even though the author's idea led to the divorce, they weren't the one who committed the infidelity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for suggesting the test, especially since it exposed the cheating.\n"
