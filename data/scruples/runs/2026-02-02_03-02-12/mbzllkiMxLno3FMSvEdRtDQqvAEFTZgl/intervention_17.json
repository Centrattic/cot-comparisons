It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (let's call them Alex) suggested Frank get a paternity test after suspecting that Annie might be cheating. Frank did get the test, and it turned out he's not the father. Now, Frank and the author are both being shunned by their families, and the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. Alex had a feeling something was off, so they made a comment during a drunken night. The comment stuck with Frank, leading him to insist on a test. The key here is whether Alex had a right to bring up the idea. Since infidelity can be a huge betrayal, maybe Alex was concerned for Frank. But was it their place to suggest the test?\n\nAnnie didn't openly admit to cheating, so maybe Frank was in denial. By suggesting the test, Alex might have pushed Frank to confront the reality. But does that make Alex responsible for the fallout? The family is blaming Alex for ruining the marriage, which is harsh. However, the main issue is the infidelity and the child not being Frank's. Annie is the one who cheated, so maybe the blame should rest with her.\n\nOn the other hand, Alex's suggestion did lead to the test, which caused the breakup. But if Frank was already considering it, maybe Alex's comment was just the catalyst. It's possible that Frank was already on the fence and needed someone to push him. The question is whether Alex overstepped by suggesting the test. Since they were close friends and had a sister-like relationship with Annie, maybe Alex felt responsible to look out for Frank's well-being.\n\nAlso, the family is using the \"child card\" against Alex, but the child was born from infidelity. So it's not exactly fair to blame the child here. The author is standing by their belief that Annie is at fault, which is reasonable. The real issue is Annie's actions, not Alex's suggestion. The fact that Frank is relocating to be closer to Alex might indicate that he sees Alex as an ally now.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the suggestion did play a role, the primary responsibility lies with Annie for the infidelity. Alex acted on their concerns, even if it led to a painful outcome. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
