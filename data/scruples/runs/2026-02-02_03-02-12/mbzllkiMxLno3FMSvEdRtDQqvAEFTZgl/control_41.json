It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nThe story is about Frank and Annie. The author is a close friend of Annie's, almost like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had suspicions. The author, after a few beers, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. That suggestion led Frank to push for the test, which revealed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and a home, and the author is getting criticized by their family for ruining a good marriage. The author supports Frank, thinking Annie is at fault, and feels the child argument is being used unfairly. Both Frank and the author are isolated now, and Frank is moving to the author's city.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the suggestion of a paternity test. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. But since they were close to Frank, maybe they thought they were helping. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big deal because it can cause a lot of emotional damage. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's role in exposing it might be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe author's defense is that Annie created the situation, but the author's comment was the catalyst. The question is whether the author had the right to intervene. Given that the author is a friend to both, maybe they felt compelled to act on their suspicions. However, they didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. In that case, maybe they should have approached it more carefully or not at all. \n\nFrank caught emotional cheating, which might mean there was already some issues. The paternity test result shows the child isn't his, so Annie was unfaithful. The author's suggestion led to the discovery. But was it right for the author to push Frank to do the test? It's possible the author overstepped their role as a friend. Even if they thought they were helping, causing the breakdown of the marriage might be seen as their fault. \n\nThe author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, which is a valid concern. The author might feel justified because Annie cheated, but the question is about whether the author was wrong in their actions. The author's actions led to the revelation, but perhaps they should have given Frank the space to handle it on his own. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, friends sometimes take it upon themselves to intervene when they suspect infidelity, but it's a sensitive area. The author might have thought they were helping Frank protect himself, but the fallout is significant. The answer here would hinge on whether the author had the right to suggest the test without being certain. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they acted on their suspicions without evidence and their actions directly led to the breakup. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's intervention caused the situation to escalate, leading to the current problems. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
