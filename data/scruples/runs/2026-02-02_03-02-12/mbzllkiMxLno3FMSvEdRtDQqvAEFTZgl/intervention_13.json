It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The story is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close friends with Annie, suspects she's cheating because Frank is away a lot. The author then suggests a paternity test after a few beers, which leads Frank to discover the infidelity and the child isn't his. Now the author is being criticized for causing the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions. They had a suspicion based on their relationship with Annie and Frank's absence. They voiced a concern, even if it was during drinking. But is that reasonable? Maybe the author felt responsible because they were close to both. However, the author wasn't certain, just had a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test might have been a way to get answers, but it's a sensitive topic to bring up casually.\n\nNext, the consequences. The test confirmed the infidelity, which led to the marriage ending. The author is blamed by family for \"ruining\" the marriage. But Annie was the one who cheated, so the root cause is her actions. The author's comment might have been the catalyst, but the core issue was the infidelity. \n\nIs the author responsible for the outcome? They weren't the one who cheated. However, maybe they overstepped by suggesting the test without knowing for sure. But considering the situation, Frank had reasons to be suspicious too. The author might have been trying to help Frank get the truth, which is understandable. \n\nAlso, the author is being blamed by their own family, which complicates things. The question is whether the author's action was justified. If they had no proof, was it right to push for a test? But Frank ended up getting one anyway, which led to the truth. If Frank was already considering it, maybe the author's comment just accelerated things. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the person who committed the infidelity is at fault. The author's role was to express concern, which could be seen as meddling, but maybe it was a necessary action. It's a tough call. Some might say the author shouldn't have interfered, while others might see it as helping Frank uncover the betrayal. Since the author wasn't the cheater, they might not be in the wrong. But maybe they should have stayed out of it. However, given the close relationship, perhaps it's understandable. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the main fault lies with Annie's infidelity. The author acted on a suspicion to help a friend, which might be a valid concern even if the method was questionable.\n"
