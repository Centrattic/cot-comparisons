It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-like friend Annie and her husband Frank. The key points here are that Frank was cheated on, and the author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the child isn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. The author knew Annie had a \"feeling\" about Frank being unfaithful but didn't have concrete evidence. They lived far away, so maybe they couldn't intervene much. Then, when the baby came, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took that suggestion seriously, got the test, and it turned out the child wasn't his. The author is now blamed for the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating on Frank. The author's suggestion might have been based on suspicion, not facts. But if there were signs of emotional cheating, maybe Frank was already unhappy. The author's intention might have been to help Frank confirm his suspicions. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big step. Even if the author had a feeling, they didn't have proof. \n\nBut then, maybe Frank should have taken action himself. The author is being called out for not keeping quiet. However, if the author believes Annie was being unfaithful, maybe they had a right to express that. The problem is that the author's suggestion led to the revelation that the child isn't Frank's, causing a lot of damage. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was unfaithful and the child isn't Frank's, then maybe the author did the right thing by encouraging a paternity test. The author might be standing up for Frank, but the way it happened might be messy. \n\nBut the author might be in the wrong because they didn't have solid evidence and their suggestion led to a situation that destroyed the marriage. Even if they had a suspicion, they shouldn't have pushed for a paternity test without more proof. Alternatively, if the marriage was already on shaky ground due to Frank's emotional cheating, maybe the marriage was doomed regardless of the author's input.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action was wrong. The author's parents and siblings think they should have kept quiet. The author, however, feels Annie is at fault. The answer hinges on whether the author had the right to intervene in this way. Since the author was a friend and had a long-standing relationship, maybe they had the right to voice their concerns. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious step that can have life-altering consequences. Without solid evidence, the author's suggestion might be seen as overstepping, even if their intent was good.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth, but the method of doing so (without evidence) and the resulting fallout could place some responsibility on them. However, since Annie was the one who cheated, the main fault lies with her. The author's role is a bit more nuanced. But depending on cultural norms and perspectives, the answer could vary. In many cases, intervening in a marriage without evidence is seen as wrong. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they shouldn't have suggested the test without proof. But others might argue it's B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help. Hmm, need to decide based on ethical standards. The key is whether the author's action was justified. Since they didn't have proof, pushing for a paternity test might be crossing a line. So I think the answer is A.\n"
