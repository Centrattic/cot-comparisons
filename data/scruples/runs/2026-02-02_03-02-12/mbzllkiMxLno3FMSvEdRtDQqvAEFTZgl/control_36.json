It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend, Annie, who's married to Frank. The author has a close relationship with both. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day shift on and off schedule. Over three years, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author sensed something. When Frank found out his child wasn't his, he mentioned the author's suggestion as the catalyst. Now the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was the one who created the situation and is standing by their actions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author noticed something was off and, during a visit, asked Frank about a paternity test after drinking. The comment stuck, leading Frank to push for a test. The result showed he wasn't the father, which ended the marriage. The author is now criticized for speaking up.\n\nFirst, the author's intent: they were concerned about Frank being the biological father. They didn't know for sure if Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. But suggesting a paternity test might have been a way to help Frank avoid being a father to someone else's child. However, the author's comment was made after drinking, which could indicate they weren't certain and maybe acted on a hunch. \n\nAnnie's situation: she had a child with someone else while married. That's clearly cheating. But the author's role is in question. By suggesting the test, the author might have interfered in Frank's marriage. However, the author has a close relationship with both parties and might have felt compelled to act based on their suspicions. \n\nWas the author wrong to bring up the suggestion? If they had a legitimate concern, maybe they were trying to help Frank. However, without concrete evidence, it's possible they overstepped. But in a situation where Frank was being deceived, the author could argue they were protecting a friend. \n\nFrank's actions after the author's comment led to the test and the marriage breakdown. The author's suggestion was a catalyst, but Annie's infidelity was the root cause. The author's parents and siblings blame the author for ruining the marriage, but Annie's actions were the main issue. The author's defense is that Annie created the situation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to intervene. The author might have been overreaching by suggesting the test without being certain. However, if they genuinely suspected infidelity, they might have felt they were helping Frank uncover the truth. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author's actions did lead to the test, but they weren't the one who caused the infidelity. So while the author's suggestion accelerated the breakup, the real problem was Annie's cheating. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were acting on concerns for a friend, even if it led to unintended consequences. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the author's intent was to help Frank, even if the method was questionable. The main responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. However, some might argue the author shouldn't have meddled. But given the situation, the author's actions were based on concern, even if it backfired.\n"
