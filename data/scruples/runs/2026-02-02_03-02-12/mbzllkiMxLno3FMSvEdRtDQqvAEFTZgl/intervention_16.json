It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend of both, like a sister figure to Annie. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years, the author felt Annie might be cheating but didn't have proof. Then, when they found out Annie was pregnant, the author, during a drunken moment, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, did the test, and the kid wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and a home, moving back in with her parents. The author is criticized by their family for causing the marriage breakdown and making Frank look immature. The author defends their actions, thinking Annie created the situation and that using the child as a reason is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's intention was to voice their suspicion, but it was a suggestion made in a casual, maybe offhand way. However, Frank acted on it, leading to the discovery of infidelity. The question is whether the author is at fault for suggesting the test. \n\nEthical considerations here: Did the author have the right to make such a suggestion? The author is a close friend but lives far away. They might not have been in a position to know for sure. However, they had a \"feeling,\" which isn't evidence. By suggesting a paternity test, they might have acted on a suspicion without solid proof, which could be seen as meddling in a private matter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned about their friend's marriage and the potential for the child's paternity being in question. If the author truly believed Frank was being deceived, maybe they thought the test was necessary for Frank's peace of mind. But the problem is that the author's suggestion led directly to the breakdown, and they were not in a position to know the truth. \n\nThe family is criticizing the author for not keeping quiet. The author's defense is that Annie was at fault. But the author's role here is as an outsider, even a close friend. Friends don't typically have the right to interfere that much in a spouse's relationship unless there's clear evidence. The author's action, though well-intentioned, might have overstepped their bounds.\n\nIn AITA situations, often the person who causes the conflict through their actions is considered at fault. Even if the intention was good, the consequences are significant. The author's suggestion led to the test, which exposed the infidelity and caused the divorce. So, the author might be seen as the one who caused the problem, even if the root issue was Annie's cheating. \n\nHowever, if the author had a legitimate concern and acted in good faith, maybe that's excusable. But the problem is that the author didn't have proof, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test is a serious step. So, in terms of responsibility, the author's action might be seen as the catalyst, making them at fault. \n\nBut then, the main wrongdoer is Annie. The author is a close friend, but their role is more of a trigger for Frank to take action. The question is about the author's fault, not Annie's. If the author had kept quiet, maybe the situation would have continued, but the marriage might have ended later in a different way. But the author's action directly led to the paternity test. \n\nIn conclusion, while Annie's infidelity is the root cause, the author's suggestion was the immediate action that led to the discovery. Depending on the perspective, the author might be seen as overstepping, especially without evidence. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted on a suspicion without proof and caused the marriage to end. However, if the author's intention was to protect Frank, maybe that's understandable. But in AITA, the focus is more on the action's impact rather than the intention. So, likely the answer is A.\n"
