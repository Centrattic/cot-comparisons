It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who suggested Frank get a paternity test is in the wrong. The scenario is that Annie, the wife, was cheating, and the child isn't Frank's. The author, who's close to both, suggested the test after drinking, and now Frank found out, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Did the author have a right to intervene? The author knew Annie since childhood and considered her a sister. They noticed something was off but couldn't act on it from afar. Then, after some drinks, they casually suggested a paternity test. That comment led Frank to get a test, which revealed the infidelity. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the author was trying to help a friend by pointing out a red flag. The emotional cheating was already an issue, and the paternity test confirmed the affair. The author might have been protecting Frank from being a father to another man's child. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's suggestion came from a place of concern but might have overstepped. They were not in a position to make that suggestion directly. However, Frank later took action, so maybe the author's role was minimal. The aftermath caused a lot of fallout, but the main issue was Annie's infidelity. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. \n\nThe family blames the author for breaking up the marriage, but the marriage was already strained due to Annie's cheating. The author's suggestion was a catalyst, but the real problem was the cheating. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to help a friend and were honest about their concerns. The consequences are more on Annie for her actions.\n"
