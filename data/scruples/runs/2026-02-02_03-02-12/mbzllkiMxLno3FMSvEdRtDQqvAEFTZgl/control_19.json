It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend, Annie, who married Frank. The author has known Annie since they were kids and feels like a sibling to her. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had a suspicion. Then when Annie gets pregnant, the author, during a drunk conversation, suggests a paternity test. Frank later insists on it, and it turns out the kid isn't his. Now the author is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and they're both isolated. Frank is moving to the author's city.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's intention was to make sure Frank wasn't an unwitting father, right? But the method was bringing it up after a few beers, which might not have been the best time. But the key here is whether the author overstepped.\n\nAnnie was the one who was cheating and possibly emotionally cheating. The author didn't know for sure, just had a feeling, but still brought it up. Frank acted on the suggestion and discovered the truth. Now the author is being criticized for causing the marriage to fall apart. But the question is, was the author wrong to suggest the test? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author was concerned about the well-being of Frank and the baby. On the other hand, maybe they shouldn't have meddled, even if they had suspicions. But since the marriage was built on a lie, maybe the truth needed to come out. The author's action led to the truth being revealed, which might have been necessary. However, the way they brought it up might have been inappropriate. Also, the author's family is blaming them, which adds to the conflict.\n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, if the author had a suspicion and tried to help Frank, even if it was in a less than ideal way, maybe they weren't in the wrong. The main issue was Annie's infidelity and the lie about the child. The author's role was to voice a concern, which Frank later acted upon. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), as the author was trying to help and the real wrongdoer is Annie. But there's a nuance here. The author's suggestion might have been the spark, but the underlying problem was Annie's actions. So the author isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
