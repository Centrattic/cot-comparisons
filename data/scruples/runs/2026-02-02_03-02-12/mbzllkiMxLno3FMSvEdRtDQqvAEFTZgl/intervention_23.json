It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is close to Annie and Frank, having known them since childhood. Annie married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a 14-day work cycle. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. When the baby was announced, the author suggested a paternity test while drunk. This suggestion led to Frank getting a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for \"ruining\" the marriage and is being blamed for the fallout.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author suspected infidelity but didn't accuse Annie directly. They made a suggestion during a casual, possibly intoxicated conversation, which Frank later acted on. The result was the end of the marriage, financial instability for Annie, and social isolation for both the author and Frank.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't have concrete evidence of cheating, just a feeling. Their suggestion to get a paternity test might have been a way to confirm Frank's suspicions, which he had already. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the method of suggesting it during a casual chat after drinking could be seen as careless. Even if the author's intention was good, the way it was brought up might have been inappropriate, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nBut then, Frank had the opportunity to act on the suggestion. The author didn't force him to take the test; they just made a comment. The responsibility could also lie with Frank for not addressing his suspicions directly with Annie. The author might argue they were trying to help, especially since Annie wasn't openly honest. However, the author's role in the situation is that of a friend, not a detective. They might not have been in a position to push for evidence without proof.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. The argument here is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test. If Annie was indeed cheating, the author's action could be seen as necessary. But if the author acted out of their own suspicion without solid reason, it's possible they were wrong. The line between helping a friend and meddling is thin here.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child and the social fallout. The author argues that Annie created the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. However, the child is innocent in this, and the breakup has left Annie in a difficult position. The author's family might feel that the author's comment was the catalyst for the family's disintegration, hence the blame.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a tough call. The author had a suspicion but no proof. They made a suggestion in a social setting, which might not be the best approach, but it's not necessarily malicious. Frank's decision to act on that suggestion is his own. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was harmful. So, is the author responsible for the consequences, or is the responsibility on Frank for acting on the suggestion?\n\nIn many cases, people are expected to handle suspicions privately and directly. The author didn't confront Annie directly but instead encouraged Frank to seek a paternity test. This could be seen as crossing a line, especially without clear evidence. However, if the author believed they were helping Frank uncover the truth, it's a gray area.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer could go either way. If the author is viewed as having meddled without knowing the full story, they might be in the wrong. If they're seen as helping Frank confront a possible betrayal, they might be justified. The key factors are the lack of direct evidence, the method of suggestion, and the consequences. The author's own family's reaction adds another layer, but their perspective might not consider the underlying issues in the marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might have been good, the action of suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as overstepping, making them at least partially responsible. However, if Frank was already considering a test and the author's suggestion was the trigger, the main responsibility lies with Frank. The author's role is more of an enabler, so depending on the context, they might be in the wrong (A) or not (B). But given the information, it's a close call. I think the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth, even if the method was flawed. So the answer would be B.\n"
