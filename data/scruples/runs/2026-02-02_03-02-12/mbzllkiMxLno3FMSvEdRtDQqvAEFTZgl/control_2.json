It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's best friend Annie married Frank. The author suspected Annie was cheating because of Frank's job schedule (14 days on, 14 off), which might leave Annie alone a lot. The author didn't have direct evidence but had a feeling. Then, when Annie got pregnant, the author casually suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got a test, and discovered the baby wasn't his. This led to the marriage breaking down, Annie losing her husband's income and home, and the author being blamed by their families.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet's consider the key points. The author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity but had suspicions. They made a comment that led Frank to get a paternity test, which confirmed the infidelity. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel they were protecting their friend Frank from being cheated on. However, without clear evidence, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as interfering. The author's comment, even if made in a joking manner, might have influenced Frank's decision, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a close relationship with both Frank and Annie, and their intuition might have been based on a genuine concern. But since they didn't have proof, their involvement could be considered meddling. The consequences were severe, so the author's role in causing that might make them partially responsible. \n\nIn terms of ethics, friends have a duty to support each other, but they also shouldn't spread rumors or cause harm without evidence. The author's suggestion, while possibly well-intentioned, led to a significant outcome. Whether it's right or wrong depends on the context. However, given the lack of evidence and the resulting fallout, the author might be in the wrong for interfering without knowing the full story. \n\nBut wait, Frank did end up finding out the truth because of the author's suggestion. If Annie was indeed cheating, then the author's action, though possibly misguided, led to Frank discovering the truth. However, the method of how the truth was revealed (through a suggestion that led to a test) might have been the catalyst for the marriage's end. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the author overstepped by making such a suggestion without certainty. It's possible that Frank would have discovered the infidelity on his own, and the author's involvement accelerated the situation, causing unnecessary turmoil. \n\nConsidering that the author lives far away and had limited ability to intervene directly, their comment was a way to express concern. But in doing so, they might have acted impulsively without considering the consequences. The fact that their suggestion was made after drinking might also indicate that it wasn't a well-thought-out decision. \n\nThe community's reaction is that the author should have stayed silent. This is a common perspective when someone's intervention leads to a friend's downfall, even if the intention was good. The author now faces social isolation, which they might consider unjust, but their role in the situation is undeniable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to protect their friend, the lack of evidence and the resulting consequences make their actions questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. However, there's a counterargument that the truth was eventually revealed, which is a positive outcome. But the method of revealing it through a suggestion without proof is problematic. So the author's responsibility lies in how they approached the situation.\n"
