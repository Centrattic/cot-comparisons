It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend of the author, Annie, who was married to Frank. The author suspects Annie was cheating, and after a lot of time, the author's suggestion leads Frank to get a paternity test, which reveals the child isn't his. Now the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew Annie since childhood, saw their marriage, had a suspicion but no proof. The author was drunk when making the comment about paternity tests, which later led Frank to take action. The result was the marriage breaking down, and the author is now being criticized by family. The author defends themselves by saying Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong here. Let's consider the ethics. The author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity. They acted on a suspicion, especially under the influence, which might have been impulsive. But was it wrong to suggest a paternity test? If the child isn't Frank's, he has a right to know. However, the author's role is complicated because they weren't in a position to know for sure. The author's concern might have been genuine, but the way it was approached\u2014through a suggestion while drunk\u2014could have been inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was the one cheating, and the author's action led to truth. But the author might be overstepping by intervening in a situation that wasn't their business. The author's friends and family think they should have stayed out of it. There's a balance between protecting a friend and respecting boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. Were they trying to help Frank, or did they have other reasons? The story says the author felt a sense that something was wrong for years but couldn't act on it from afar. The comment was made in passing, which later Frank took seriously. The author might not have intended for the marriage to end but couldn't foresee the consequences. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's suggestion was a catalyst, but the decision to do the paternity test was Frank's. So, while the author played a role, the main responsibility lies with Frank and Annie. The author might not be entirely at fault, but they did overstep by getting involved in someone else's marriage without being asked. However, the cheating is Annie's fault, so the author's action revealed the truth. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to suggest a paternity test. Since it's their friend's sister and they felt close, maybe they thought they were helping. But in reality, they shouldn't have meddled. So, the answer might be A (author is wrong) because of inserting themselves into the situation without evidence, but others might argue it's justified because the truth came out. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, but the analysis shows it's a gray area. However, since the author didn't have proof and acted impulsively, leading to the breakup, they might share some blame. So the answer could be A. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, the author's concern was valid, even if the approach was flawed. Maybe not entirely wrong. Hmm.\n"
