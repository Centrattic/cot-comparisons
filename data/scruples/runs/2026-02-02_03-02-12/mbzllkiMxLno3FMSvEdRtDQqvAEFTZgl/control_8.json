It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (me) is in the wrong for supporting the husband, Frank, who was cheated on. The situation is a bit complex. So, first, the key points here.\n\nAnnie and Frank were married for three years. Frank is in the oil industry with a schedule of two weeks on, two weeks off. During this time, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. The author, who's known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister, later suggests a paternity test to Frank, which leads to the discovery that the child isn't his. The author is getting blamed by their family for ruining a marriage, and Frank and the author are both ostracized.\n\nNow, the main question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLooking at the scenario, the author's intention was to help Frank ensure the child was his. The suggestion was made after drinking, which might have been a slip-up, but the author's motivation seems to be based on a long-standing feeling of doubt. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity, just a suspicion. The act of suggesting the paternity test led to the discovery, which caused the breakdown of the marriage. \n\nBut here's the thing: infidelity is a serious breach in a relationship. Annie didn't directly confess, but the child isn't Frank's. The author's role was to facilitate Frank's realization of the betrayal. While the suggestion might have been the catalyst for the divorce, the root cause was Annie's actions. The author didn't have malicious intent; they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the situation differently. Maybe there was a way to get Annie to confess without involving a paternity test, but that's speculative. The author's suggestion did lead to the truth coming out, which is arguably the right thing for Frank to know. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for the fallout, but the real responsibility lies with Annie for the infidelity and deception. The author is being painted as the villain for exposing the truth, which is a bit unfair. Supporting someone in discovering that they've been cheated on isn't inherently wrong. The author's actions were based on their concern for Frank's well-being and the validity of the relationship. \n\nIn such cases, the person who committed the infidelity is at fault, not the one who helped uncover it. Even though the method (suggesting a paternity test) might have been indirect, the intention was valid. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions; they merely revealed the truth. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
