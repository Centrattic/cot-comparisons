It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister figure Annie, her husband Frank, and the author's role in suggesting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't act on it due to distance. When Frank announced a pregnancy, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test, which proved the child wasn't his. Now, the author faces backlash from family for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial security and home. The author stands by their decision, thinking Annie was at fault.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank by suggesting the test. Let's consider the ethical angles. The author suspected infidelity but didn't have proof. By suggesting the test, they might have acted on a hunch without knowing the full story. However, Frank was the one who insisted on the test, so the author's role was indirect. \n\nAnnie's actions\u2014emotional cheating and having a child with another man\u2014are clearly problematic. The author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. But the method was through a casual comment after drinking. The author might have overstepped by not confronting Annie directly or giving her a chance to explain. However, given the distance and lack of direct evidence, it's hard to fault the author for trying to help Frank.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's suggestion led to significant consequences. Frank's isolation and Annie's financial hardship are real issues. The author's family criticizes them for causing this, which adds another layer. The author's role was to support Frank, but they might not be responsible for Annie's choices. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to assess if the author acted unethically or overstepped. Here, the author didn't have malicious intent. They acted on suspicion and tried to help a friend. Frank's decision to act on the suggestion is his own responsibility. The author isn't directly responsible for the fallout beyond their role in the suggestion. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
