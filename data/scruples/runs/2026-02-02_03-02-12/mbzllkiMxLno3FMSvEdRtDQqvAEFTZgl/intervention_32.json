It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-in-law, Annie, who they've known since childhood. The author supports Frank, who was cheated on, and suggested a paternity test after suspecting Annie had an affair. The test confirmed the child wasn't Frank's, leading to the marriage breakdown. Now the author is facing criticism from their family for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her home and income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's role was a friend to both Annie and Frank. They noticed something off but couldn't act on it from afar. Then, during a visit, they casually suggested a paternity test after drinking. The comment stuck, and Frank took action. The key points are: was the suggestion to test an overreach, or was it justified given the suspicions?\n\nAnnie's infidelity is the root issue. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth, which he might not have done otherwise. However, the author's suggestion, even if well-meaning, might have played a role in the marriage's collapse. But is that the author's fault? People in relationships are responsible for their own actions. If Frank and Annie had issues, they needed to address them. The author might not be at fault for pointing out a red flag, especially since they weren't directly involved in the cheating.\n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them for the fallout. But the author isn't the one who had the affair. Annie's actions led to the situation. The author's suggestion was a catalyst, but the primary responsibility lies with the couple. The author might be in a tough spot because they're being blamed for something they didn't cause. \n\nThe author's stance is that Annie created the situation, which is accurate. The child's situation is mentioned, but the child's well-being isn't the author's responsibility. The main issue is the infidelity, not the author's intervention. So, while the author's comment might have contributed, they aren't in the wrong for trying to help Frank get the truth. The answer is probably B.\n"
