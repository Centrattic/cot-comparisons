It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them \"they\" for now) suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank discovering that the baby isn't his because Annie was emotionally cheating. Now, Frank is isolated, and the author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author is Annie's sister, known her since childhood. Annie married Frank, who works in oil and has a schedule of 14 days on, 14 off. The author had a suspicion about Annie's infidelity but couldn't do much due to distance. During a visit, after some beers, the author suggested a paternity test, which Frank later took. The result showed the child isn't his. Now, the author's family is upset, saying they should have kept their mouth shut. The author feels Annie is the one who created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author had a suspicion but didn't have direct evidence. They live far away, so maybe they weren't in a position to intervene directly. However, they did bring up the idea of a paternity test, which led to the discovery. The test was done because the author planted the suggestion. But was the suggestion justified? If they had a valid reason to suspect, maybe it's not their fault. But if they just had a feeling without evidence, maybe they crossed a line.\n\nAlso, consider the relationship. The author is a close friend/sibling to both Frank and Annie. But Annie was the one cheating. The author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, but maybe they should be blaming Annie instead. The author might be taking the fall for something that was Annie's wrongdoing. \n\nHowever, the suggestion of a paternity test could have been a mistake, even if based on a suspicion. Frank might have been considering it already, and the author just pushed him over the edge. But if there was no evidence, maybe the author shouldn't have made that comment. On the other hand, if the author had a good reason based on observations, perhaps it was right to raise the issue.\n\nAnother angle: the author's role as a sister to Annie. If Annie was cheating, the author might feel conflicted. But by bringing up the paternity test, they might have acted out of concern for Frank or their own feelings. The problem is that without direct proof, suggesting a test can be seen as harmful. Paternity tests can be destructive, so the author should have been cautious.\n\nHowever, the story mentions that Annie never directly said she was seeing someone but the author had \"a feeling.\" It's possible the author's intuition was correct, but acting on it without evidence can still be problematic. The test led to the child not being Frank's, which caused the marriage to end. The author's family is upset because they think the author caused the breakup by suggesting the test.\n\nBut the real issue is Annie's emotional cheating and infidelity. The author isn't the one cheating; Annie is. The author's action was a suggestion that revealed the truth, even if it caused pain. If the marriage was already in trouble due to her infidelity, maybe the author isn't at fault for bringing it to light. However, they might be responsible for the method they used\u2014like suggesting a paternity test without clear evidence.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author acted on a suspicion they had, perhaps they had a right to do so, especially if they were close to Frank. But the way they approached it (after drinking) might not have been the best. Alternatively, if the marriage was doomed because of Annie's actions, the author isn't the main problem.\n\nThe answer likely depends on whether the author's suggestion was justified. Since Annie was the one cheating, the author might not be in the wrong for exposing the truth. The family is focusing on the author's role in the breakup rather than Annie's infidelity. So, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
