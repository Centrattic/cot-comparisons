It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the story is about Frank and Annie's marriage. Annie was cheating, and the baby isn't Frank's. The author, who's a close friend of Annie since childhood, suspected something but didn't know for sure. During a visit, after some drinks, the author suggested a paternity test. Frank ended up getting the test, which confirmed the infidelity. Now, the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The author stands by their decision, thinking Annie was at fault.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider the key points. The author's intention was to help Frank discover the truth. Cheating is a serious issue, and the author felt something was off. However, the way they approached it was by suggesting a paternity test after drinking. That might not have been the best approach. But the author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. \n\nFrank later took action based on that suggestion, leading to the breakup. The author is now being criticized for causing the family to fall apart. But did the author have a right to intervene? Since they were close friends, maybe they thought they were helping. However, maybe they overstepped by bringing it up, especially if they weren't certain. But if the author had stayed silent, Frank might have continued being deceived. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had enough evidence to make that comment. They didn't have proof, just a feeling. But in a marriage where one partner is away for two weeks, it's possible for cheating to happen. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might have been necessary, even if it caused a rift. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been too quick to accuse without concrete evidence. However, the situation is that Annie was the one cheating, so the author isn't entirely wrong in suspecting. The real issue is the method of confronting the situation. But in the end, the author's intention was to help Frank, even if it caused immediate problems. The family is blaming the author, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They tried to help a friend uncover the truth, even if it led to a bad outcome. So the answer might be B (No). However, there's a nuance here. Did the author have the right to make that suggestion without talking to Annie first? Maybe not, but given the circumstances, it's hard to say. But since the answer is AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community would likely side with the author if they believe the cheating was the real issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
