It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a friend of both, like a sister figure to Annie. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years, the author felt that Annie was seeing someone else but couldn't do much because of the distance. When they found out Annie was pregnant, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting criticized for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a right to bring up the paternity test. The author suspected infidelity but didn't have proof. By suggesting the test, they might have acted on a hunch. But was that overstepping? Maybe the author thought they were helping Frank, but it led to the marriage ending. However, Annie was emotionally cheating, so maybe there was some truth to the suspicion. \n\nThe author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. But if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then maybe the author's intervention uncovered the truth. However, the method of bringing it up\u2014after drinking and in a casual way\u2014might have been inappropriate. Should the author have approached it more carefully or let Frank handle it himself?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the child. People are saying the author should consider the child, but if the child isn't Frank's, maybe it's better for Frank to know. However, the way the information was revealed could have been handled better. The author's role here is a friend, so they might have acted out of concern but without knowing the full story.\n\nAnnie's consequences are severe, but if she was cheating, maybe she's responsible for her actions. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank, even if it backfired. On the other hand, maybe the author should have stayed out of it to avoid causing harm. It's a tough call. The key factors are intent, method, and consequences. The author's intent was to help, but the method was questionable. However, if the suspicion was valid, maybe the outcome was justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author acted on a suspicion that turned out true, even if the approach was flawed.\n"
