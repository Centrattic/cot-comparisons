I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The writer's partner and her family are used to showing up unannounced, but the writer isn't a fan. They expressed their discomfort during a meal after a trip, which led to tension because the partner's family now sees the writer as being too opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of shared living spaces. The writer mentions that the house is as much theirs as their partner's. So, it's reasonable for them to have boundaries about unexpected visitors. Expressing a preference for privacy or personal time isn't unreasonable. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The writer did communicate their feelings, even if it caused a divide. \n\nThe partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the writer is wrong to set boundaries. The writer isn't being aggressive just because they voiced their opinion. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not being used to someone setting firm boundaries. \n\nAlso, the writer usually holds back their opinions around the partner's family, so it's not like they're being confrontational out of nowhere. The issue here is about differing expectations, not necessarily the writer being in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong. They have the right to express their needs and set boundaries in their shared home. The answer should be B.\n"
