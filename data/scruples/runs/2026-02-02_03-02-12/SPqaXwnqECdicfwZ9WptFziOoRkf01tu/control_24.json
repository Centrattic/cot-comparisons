I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends often show up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained they might have things to do and like having days to themselves without interruptions. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. This caused a divide because the partner thinks her family shouldn't be restricted, and the author is labeled as being too aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author lives in the house with their partner, so it's their home too. The partner's family is used to dropping by without notice, which the author finds inconvenient. The author is asserting their right to privacy and personal space, which is a valid concern. However, the partner is on their side, but her family is upset because they feel it's unfair. The author usually holds back their opinions around the family, so this time they spoke up, which might have been a shock to the partner's family.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a boundary issue. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries in their own home. Everyone deserves some personal space and time without unexpected guests. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where drop-ins are common, but that doesn't mean the author has to accept it. The problem arises because the partner's family is now upset, and the partner is caught between two viewpoints. The author's response seems reasonable\u2014they didn't attack the family but explained their perspective calmly. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" seems a bit harsh if the author was just stating their feelings without hostility.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like discussing it privately with the partner first or finding a compromise. But given that the conversation came up during dinner and the author explained their stance respectfully, it's not necessarily wrong. The partner's family's reaction might be more about not liking to be challenged rather than the content of the author's opinion. The key point is that the author is standing up for their needs in their own home, which is their right. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
