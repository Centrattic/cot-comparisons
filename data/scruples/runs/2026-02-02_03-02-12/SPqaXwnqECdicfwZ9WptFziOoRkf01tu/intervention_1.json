I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to dropping by each other's houses as a surprise. The author expressed their dislike for this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When two people live together, especially in a committed relationship, their living arrangements should respect each other's needs. The author mentions that they usually bite their tongue around the partner's family but finally spoke up. That suggests they were trying to avoid conflict but had to set a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are about personal space and mutual respect. The author isn't against the partner's family, but they value having time to themselves and not being caught off guard. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from not being used to having their habits challenged. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author did express their feelings, even if it caused some tension. It's important to recognize that everyone has different comfort levels with social interactions, especially in their own home. The author's stance is about maintaining their own peace and preparing their home, which is a reasonable request.\n\nThe partner's side might feel that the author is being too rigid, but it's also about mutual adjustment. The author isn't rejecting the partner's family, just asserting their own needs. Since the author owns the house (or shares it equally), they have the right to set boundaries about who enters and when. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their feelings and are standing by their need for personal space. The conflict arises from differing expectations, and the author is justified in asserting their side. So, the answer should be B.\n"
