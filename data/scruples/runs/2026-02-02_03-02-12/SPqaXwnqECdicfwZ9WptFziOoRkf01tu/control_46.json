I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not liking unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think showing up unannounced is a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might be busy or need alone time. The partner is upset, and the author's opinion caused a divide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and mutual respect. The author is expressing their discomfort with unannounced visits, which is a valid personal preference. Everyone has the right to their own space and privacy. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries in their shared home. \n\nThe author mentioned that it's their house too, so they have a legitimate point about ownership and personal space. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a misunderstanding. Expressing one's needs isn't aggression; it's communication. \n\nHowever, the way the author communicated their feelings could be a factor. They said they \"bit their tongue\" before, so maybe this was the first time voicing their opinion. The partner might feel blindsided if the author didn't discuss this before. But the author is justified in asserting their needs now. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to respect each other's preferences. The partner's family might need to adjust if they're living together. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to have control over their home environment. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're standing up for their space, which is a healthy boundary. The issue might be more about the partner and family not respecting those boundaries, not the author's stance.\n"
