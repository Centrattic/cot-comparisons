I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests and how the author expressed their dislike for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends just show up as surprises. The partner and sister like it, but the author doesn't. The author explained they might have things to do, need days to themselves, and want the house clean. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the parents labeling the author as aggressive for usually keeping their opinions to themselves.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nTo decide, I should consider boundaries and communication. The author is expressing their discomfort with surprise visits, which is a valid boundary. The partner's family might see it as a cultural or family tradition, but the author has a right to their own space. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" is about shared ownership, which is reasonable. The partner's family might feel disrespected, but the author's stance isn't unreasonable. The key is whether expressing these boundaries is wrong. Since the author communicated their feelings respectfully, even if it caused conflict, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
