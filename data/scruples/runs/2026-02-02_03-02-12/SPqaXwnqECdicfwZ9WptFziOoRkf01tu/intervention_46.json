I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that after returning from Iceland, the author, their partner, and her family had a meal where the topic of surprise visits came up. The author expressed discomfort with unannounced guests because they might be busy or need alone time, and also mentioned the house's state. The partner's family thinks it's a nice surprise, but the author's opinion caused a rift. The partner is upset, and the author is now seen as aggressively opinionated by her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is unreasonable. The key points here are about personal boundaries and shared living space. The author is in a relationship and shares a house with their partner. The conflict is about uninvited guests. The author has valid reasons: needing personal time and not wanting unexpected interruptions. It's important to respect each other's boundaries in a relationship. \n\nThe partner's side argues that it's a nice gesture for family to drop by, but the author is asserting their own needs. The problem arises when the partner and her family don't respect those boundaries, possibly because they're used to a different dynamic. The author's statement about the house being \"as much theirs as hers\" is a reasonable assertion of shared space. \n\nThe author might be seen as being firm, but it's about setting boundaries. The partner and her family labeling them as aggressively opinionated might indicate a sensitivity to the author finally speaking up after usually being quiet. That could imply that the author was previously accommodating but now their limits are being tested. \n\nIn relationships, communication about personal boundaries is crucial. If the author had concerns, expressing them isn't wrong. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations if they live in a shared space. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
