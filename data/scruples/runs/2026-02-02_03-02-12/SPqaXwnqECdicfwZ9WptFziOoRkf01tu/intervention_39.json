I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. The key points here are about boundaries and differing expectations.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner had just come back from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. The discussion arose about the partner's parents and their friends showing up as surprises. The author expressed discomfort with this, mentioning that they might have things to do and need some alone time. The partner's side seems upset because they feel it's unfair, and the author is now seen as being too aggressive.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, relationship dynamics, and personal boundaries. The author is sharing their honest feelings, which is valid. It's important to respect each other's living space. The partner's family might be used to a more open, spontaneous approach, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries. The author's house is shared, so they have the right to voice their preferences. However, the way the author expressed their opinion might have come off as abrupt, especially if they usually hold back. But the core issue is about differing expectations, not necessarily the author being in the wrong. The partner's family's reaction of labeling them as aggressively opinionated might be an overreaction. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their space and privacy. So the answer is B.\n"
