I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family like to drop by each other's houses as surprises. The author dislikes this because they might have things to do and want some alone time. He mentioned that he wouldn't want the house to be messy if people show up unannounced.\n\nThe partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, but the author says it's his house too. The partner's parents are labeling him as aggressively opinionated because he usually holds back his opinions around them.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let's break it down. Boundaries in relationships are important. If someone feels uncomfortable with surprise visits, it's reasonable to express that. The author is stating his preference, which is valid. He's not being aggressive, just setting boundaries. The partner's family, on the other hand, might have different social norms. The conflict arises because their expectations don't align. The author isn't wrong for wanting his space. The partner and her family need to respect his boundaries, but he's also in a position where he's standing up for his needs. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
