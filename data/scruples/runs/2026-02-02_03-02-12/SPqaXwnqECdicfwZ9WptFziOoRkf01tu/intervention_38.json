I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests at their home, which is shared with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author's partner and her family view surprise visits as a nice gesture. The author, however, feels it's intrusive and prefers having days to themselves without unexpected company. They mentioned that the house might not be tidy if people show up unannounced, which is a valid point about personal space and privacy.\n\nThe key here is that the author is asserting their boundaries. They're not being aggressive; they're stating their preferences. The partner and her family might not realize that the author needs personal time and space, which is something everyone is entitled to. The author's response seems reasonable and respectful, even if they usually hold back their opinions. The conflict arises from differing expectations about personal space versus family time.\n\nThe partner's reaction suggests that they see the surprise visits as a family norm, but the author is now standing up for their own needs. It's important in relationships to communicate boundaries, especially when living together. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're advocating for their own comfort. The family's labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from discomfort with the new boundaries, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing legitimate needs and asserting their right to personal space, which is crucial in a shared living situation.\n"
