I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in a situation where they expressed discomfort with unexpected guests. The context is that after a trip, the author and their partner's family discussed the habit of showing up unannounced at each other's homes. The author voiced their dislike for this, explaining that they need time to themselves and don't want to be caught off guard. The partner and her family are upset, feeling it's unfair, and the author is now seen as being aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and communication. The author is in a shared living situation, so they have a right to set boundaries. Expressing that they don't like unannounced visits isn't unreasonable. People have different preferences regarding personal space and time. The author's partner might be more flexible, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to state their own needs. \n\nThe partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" is a bit extreme, especially if the author was calm and explained their reasons. Maybe the partner and her family didn't expect the author to voice their opinion so directly, which could lead to tension. However, it's important that all parties respect each other's boundaries once they're established.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their preferences, but maybe there's a need for clearer communication or compromise. However, since the question is whether the author is at fault, the answer seems to be no. They're justified in setting their boundaries.\n"
