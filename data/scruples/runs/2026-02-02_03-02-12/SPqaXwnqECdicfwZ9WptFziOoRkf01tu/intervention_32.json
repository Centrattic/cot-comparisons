I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not liking unexpected guests. The person (author) shares that after returning from a trip, they had a discussion with their partner and her family about surprise visits. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do and want some alone time. The partner's family is upset, calling the author aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The author is stating their boundaries, which is generally a healthy thing. They mentioned that the house is as much theirs as their partner's, so having a say in who comes over makes sense. The key points here are the right to set personal boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nThe partner's family seems to have different expectations, but the author isn't wrong for having different preferences. However, the way the author communicated their feelings might have influenced the outcome. The user said they usually bite their tongue, then expressed their opinion, leading to being labeled as aggressive. It's possible that the tone or method of communication could have been smoother, but the content of their message is valid.\n\nIn relationships, especially with blended families, differing views on social norms are common. The author isn't wrong for asserting their needs. The main issue here is the clash between the author's boundaries and the family's traditions. The problem isn't the author's stance but possibly the family's inability to respect those boundaries. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
