I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a meal. During the meal, they discussed the family's habit of showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like this, but the author doesn't. The author expressed their discomfort, mentioning needing time on their own and not wanting the house to be messy. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the author's house being emphasized as their shared home. The author is now labeled as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nSo, the main issue is boundaries regarding guests. The author is asserting their personal space and preferences. The partner's family sees unannounced visits as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The conflict arises from differing expectations and communication styles.\n\nI should consider cultural norms here. In some cultures, dropping by uninvited is common, but it's not universally accepted. The author is setting boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. The partner is caught between two expectations, leading to tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They clearly stated their feelings without being aggressive, as per the story. They mentioned needing personal time and the state of their home. The partner's family's reaction might be due to not being aware of these boundaries beforehand. The author isn't refusing entirely but is expressing a preference. The partner's family might feel disrespected because their social norms are different, but the author's right to their own space is valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're asserting their needs, which is healthy. The issue is more about differing expectations and the partner not mediating the conflict effectively. The author isn't being malicious but is standing up for their own comfort, which is reasonable.\n"
