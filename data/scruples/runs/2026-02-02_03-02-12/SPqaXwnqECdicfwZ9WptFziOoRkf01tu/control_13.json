I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like that as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The author explained they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and they don't want the house in disarray if someone shows up unexpectedly. Now there's a divide because the partner is upset that the family can't just drop by, and the author is saying it's their house too. The partner's family is calling the author aggressive for sharing their opinion, which they usually don't do.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and shared living space. The author is expressing that they don't like surprise guests, which is a valid personal preference. The partner's family sees it as a nice gesture, but the author sees it as a disruption. The author is standing up for their own needs, which is important in a relationship. However, the way the author expressed their feelings might have come off as confrontational, especially since they mentioned the house being a mess and not wanting people to bother them. The partner's family feels offended because they're used to a different dynamic. \n\nBut wait, the author did mention their reasons calmly, right? They said they have things to do and need time to themselves. That's about setting boundaries. The partner is upset because she thinks her family shouldn't be restricted, but the author is part of the household now. So, the author isn't wrong for having their own preferences. It's about mutual respect. Maybe the partner's family isn't respecting the author's boundaries by showing up unannounced. The author is asserting their voice, which they had been holding back before. It's important for both sides to communicate and find a middle ground. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The issue might be more about the partner expecting the family to continue their habits without considering the author's needs. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
