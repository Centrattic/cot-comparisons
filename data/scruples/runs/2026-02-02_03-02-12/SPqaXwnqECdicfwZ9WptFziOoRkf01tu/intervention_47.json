I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests at their home, which is shared with their partner and her family. The partner and family see showing up as a nice surprise, but the author prefers privacy and having days to themselves without interruptions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's house is a shared space, so their opinion about unannounced visits should be valid. It's reasonable for someone to want personal space and time to themselves. The author didn't say it's never okay, just that they don't like it. They also mentioned possible reasons like needing to get things done or the house not being ready. These are legitimate concerns.\n\nThe partner's family is reacting negatively, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated,\" which seems harsh. Expressing a preference shouldn't be seen as aggression, especially in a shared living situation. The key point here is that both sides have different social norms. The author's discomfort is valid, and they have a right to set boundaries in their own home. The partner needs to mediate and find a middle ground where both her family's traditions and the author's need for privacy are respected.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable here. They communicated their feelings calmly and gave examples. There's no indication of them being hostile or overbearing. The family's reaction seems to be the issue, not the author's stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs in a shared space, which is perfectly acceptable.\n"
