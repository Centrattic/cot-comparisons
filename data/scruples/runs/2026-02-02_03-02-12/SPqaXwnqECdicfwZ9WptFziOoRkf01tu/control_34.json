I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends sometimes show up unannounced at each other's houses as a surprise. The partner and sister think it's nice, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained that they might have things to do and need a day to themselves without unexpected guests, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. This caused a divide because the partner feels it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's partner's family labeled them as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries in relationships and respecting each other's preferences. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a personal boundary. The partner's family seems to have a different social norm where dropping by without notice is acceptable. The author's partner is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, especially when it's a new partner meeting family, communication is key. The author did express their feelings, albeit maybe in a way that the partner's family didn't expect. The author's main point is about needing personal space and respecting the home environment. They didn't necessarily say they dislike the family, just that unannounced visits are an issue for them. The partner's family's reaction of labeling them as aggressive suggests a possible cultural or expectation clash.\n\nHowever, it's valid for the author to set boundaries. It's not unreasonable to want control over one's schedule and home. The problem arises if the partner's family feels that their traditions or ways are being dismissed. But the author's right to have their own preferences should be respected as well.\n\nThe partner is in a tricky spot because she might feel torn between her family's habits and her partner's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for expressing their needs, especially when it's a shared home. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations since it's a shared living space now. The author's approach could have been more diplomatic, but the core issue is about differing expectations, not inherent wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They are asserting their boundaries, which is important in any relationship. The issue is more about differing values and communication styles rather than the author being at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
