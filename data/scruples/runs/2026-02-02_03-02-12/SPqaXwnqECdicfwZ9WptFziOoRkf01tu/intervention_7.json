I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland. They had a nice meal planned, and during that, the topic of surprise visits came up. The author expressed discomfort with unexpected guests, explaining they need some alone time and don't want the house messy. The partner's family feels it's unfair, and the author is now seen as too opinionated.\n\nSo, the main issue is about boundaries. The author is asserting their right to have space and control over when people visit their home. The partner's family is used to dropping by without notice, which the author disagrees with. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect. The author is not wrong to set boundaries, especially in a shared home. However, the way the author expressed their opinion might have come off as abrupt. The partner's family might feel disrespected if the author didn't consider their traditions or if the conversation was handled poorly. \n\nBut the author did explain their reasons calmly, mentioning needing personal time and house state. The partner's family's reaction might be more about not wanting to change their habits rather than the author being wrong. \n\nThe key here is that boundaries are personal. The author isn't in the wrong for having different preferences. The partner's family isn't wrong either, but they need to adjust if they're living together or sharing a home. The conflict arises from differing expectations. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their needs, which is valid. The issue is about differing perspectives, not a clear error on the author's part. The partner's family needs to respect the author's boundaries if they want to maintain harmony.\n"
