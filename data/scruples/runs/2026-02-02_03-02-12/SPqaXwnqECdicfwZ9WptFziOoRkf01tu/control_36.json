I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests.\n\nThe author is part of a couple, and they went on a trip with their partner's family. Now they want to have a nice meal at a fancy restaurant to wrap up the vacation. The topic came up when discussing their partner's parents and friends just showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained they might have things to do and need some alone time, plus they don't want the house to be messy. This caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's house is as much theirs as the partner's. The family labels the author as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is expressing their preference about uninvited guests. They have their own needs for privacy and personal space. The partner's family is used to this kind of spontaneity, but the author isn't. The author made their feelings known, which led to conflict. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both parties respect each other's boundaries. The author is asserting their own space, which is a valid need. The partner's family might not understand, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The key here is whether the author overstepped by expressing their opinion. The author didn't say it's wrong for the family to do that, just that they don't like it. They also mentioned it's their house as well, which is a point about shared living space. \n\nThe family's reaction of labeling the author as aggressive might be due to not respecting their boundaries. The author tried to communicate their needs, which is healthy. The partner is caught in the middle, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nI think the right answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and express their preferences, even if it upsets others.\n"
