I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their partner's family having differing views on unexpected guests. The author expressed dislike for surprise visitors, and now there's tension because the partner's family feels it's unfair and the author is seen as being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author shares a home with their partner, so they have a right to their space and privacy. The partner's family has a habit of showing up unannounced, which the author finds inconvenient. The author communicated their feelings calmly, explaining they need personal time and that the house should be presentable. However, the partner is defending her family, and they're labeling the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're stating their boundaries, which is reasonable. Everyone has the right to set boundaries in a shared living space. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where unannounced visits are acceptable, but that doesn't make it right. The author isn't being aggressive; they're expressing their needs. The partner's family's reaction seems to be more about their own expectations rather than the author's actions. \n\nThe divide comes from differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for wanting privacy. They're not being rude; they're being honest. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if they want to maintain a good relationship with the author. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're standing up for their space, which is valid.\n"
