I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a pre-booked fancy meal after a trip. The discussion came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, mentioning needing time for themselves and not wanting the house to be messy. The partner feels it's unfair, and the author's opinion is seen as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to determine if the author is correct in their stance. Personal boundaries are important. The author is cohabiting, so the house is shared. The partner's family might have different social norms, but the author has the right to set boundaries. The partner's family's surprise visits could be intrusive, especially if the author wasn't consulted. The author's response was direct but reasonable. The partner's family's reaction to labeling them as aggressive seems unfair, as the author is asserting their needs. \n\nPossible considerations: Cultural differences in social norms, communication styles, and mutual respect. The author's main issue is about personal space and preparation time. The partner's family might not realize the impact of their actions. The author's approach might have been abrupt, but the underlying issue is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to express their discomfort and set boundaries in their shared home. The partner and her family need to respect those boundaries.\n"
