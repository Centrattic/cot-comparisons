I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner's family had just come back from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. The author expressed their dislike for surprise guests because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The partner's family seems upset, thinking it's unfair, but the author is standing their ground, saying it's their house too.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author is setting a boundary about their personal space and time. It's reasonable for someone to want to have control over their schedule and not have unplanned visitors. The partner's family might not be considering the author's perspective, expecting the same social norms they're used to.\n\nThe author didn't act out or be aggressive; they simply shared their feelings. The partner's family labeled them as aggressively opinionated, which seems like a misinterpretation. The author's right to have their house rules respected is valid. They are part of the household, so their input matters.\n\nI think the author is in the right here because they're asserting their personal boundaries without being confrontational. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not from the author being wrong.\n"
