I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner's family who often drop by without notice. The author expressed their discomfort, leading to a conflict with the partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They value personal space and time, which is a common need. They mentioned having things to do and wanting days to themselves. This is reasonable. The partner, however, sees these surprise visits as nice, so there's a cultural or personal difference in expectations here.\n\nThe author's house is shared with the partner, so they have a right to set boundaries. The key point is that the author communicated their feelings calmly, not aggressively. They even finished by saying they wouldn't want the house to be messy if others showed up. That shows consideration, not just self-interest.\n\nThe partner and family's reaction seems to stem from differing views on social norms. The partner is upset because they feel it's unfair, but the author is asserting their right to privacy and autonomy in their shared home. The author isn't being aggressive; they're voicing their needs. The family's labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair, especially since the author usually holds back their opinions to avoid conflict.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to respect each other's needs. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially in their own home. The partner needs to understand that the author's needs are valid too. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
