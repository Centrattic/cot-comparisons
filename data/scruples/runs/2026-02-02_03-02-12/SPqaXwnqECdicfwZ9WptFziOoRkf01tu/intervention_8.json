I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner's family showing up unannounced, and the author expressing discomfort with that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and their partner just came back from a trip, had a booked dinner, and during the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up as surprises. The partner and sister liked surprises, but the author didn't, explaining they might need personal time or have tasks. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the in-laws think the author is being aggressively opinionated because they usually hold back.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about boundaries. The author is setting a boundary about unexpected guests, which the partner and her family are not respecting. The author is asserting their right to have the house as much as the partner. \n\nI think the author is justified in expressing their feelings here. People have different comfort levels with social interactions. The author isn't against guests entirely but wants to know in advance. The partner's family's behavior is considered rude by some standards, and the author is just stating their preference. The divide comes from the partner not supporting the author's boundary, which is the partner's issue, not the author's. The author isn't wrong for wanting control over their own space. So, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
