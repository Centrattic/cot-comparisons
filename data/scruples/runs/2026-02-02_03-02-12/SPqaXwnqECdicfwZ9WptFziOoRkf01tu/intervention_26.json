I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author didn't like the idea of people showing up unannounced at each other's houses. They expressed their opinion, and now there's a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is part of a shared living situation with their partner, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might be used to a more open, surprise visit approach, but that doesn't mean the author's preference is invalid. \n\nExpressing a dislike for unexpected guests is reasonable. The author explained their reasons: needing time to themselves and not wanting the house to be in disarray. These are valid concerns. The partner's family taking offense might be more about their own expectations than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe partner is mediating here, saying it's unfair. But the author is asserting their space, which is important in any living arrangement. The key point is mutual respect. The author isn't being aggressive without cause; they're stating their needs. The family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" could be a defense mechanism because their own habits are being challenged.\n\nNo one should have to live in a way that makes them uncomfortable unless they've agreed otherwise. The author's right to their own space isn't wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
