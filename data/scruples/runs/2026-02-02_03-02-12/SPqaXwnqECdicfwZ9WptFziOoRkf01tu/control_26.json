I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who frequently have unannounced visits. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is in a relationship and part of a shared household. They pre-booked a meal after a trip, which suggests planning ahead. The author's main issue is with unexpected guests and needing personal space. The partner's family views these visits as nice surprises, but the author feels it's intrusive.\n\nThe author's argument is that the house is shared, and they have their own needs (like getting things done or having a day to themselves). The partner's family is upset, thinking it's unfair they can't drop by. The author didn't express this before, which might have contributed to the sudden conflict.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. Partners should communicate their preferences. The author did express their feelings, which is valid. However, maybe the way they communicated it could be smoother, but the content is justified. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective before. The house being a shared space means both sides should respect each other's needs. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries here. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're asserting their space in a shared environment.\n"
