I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they expressed disliking unexpected guests. The situation is that after a trip, they had a meal discussing how the partner's family visits each other without notice. The author didn't like that and explained their reasons, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author shares a home with their partner, so they have a right to set boundaries about their space. It's reasonable for someone to want privacy and time to themselves. The author's concern about the house being in disarray if guests show up unannounced is practical too.\n\nThe partner's family might be used to a different dynamic, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The key here is mutual respect. The author communicated their feelings, which is important. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a reaction to the boundaries being set, which is a common issue when people feel their habits are being challenged.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they usually bite their tongue, so this might be the first time they've expressed this. It's possible the family wasn't expecting that and felt it was out of nowhere. However, that doesn't justify their reaction. The author's stance is valid because sharing a home means both parties should respect each other's preferences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their space and expressed their feelings calmly. The conflict arises from differing expectations, but that doesn't make the author at fault.\n"
