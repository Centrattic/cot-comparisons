I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that after a trip, the author, their partner, and her family were discussing how the partner's parents and friends drop by unexpectedly. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need personal time and don't want the house unprepared. Now there's tension because the partner and her family are upset, saying it's unfair since it's their house too.\n\nFirst, I need to assess boundaries and communication. The author is sharing their feelings about needing personal space and not wanting unannounced visits. That seems reasonable. People have different preferences regarding privacy. The author's partner and her family might see the house as a shared space, so their perspective is also valid. However, the author made their stance clear, which might not have been expected by the family, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, expressing one's needs isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it's communicated matters. The author mentioned they usually bite their tongue, so this might be the first time they've spoken up, which could explain the family's reaction. The key here is mutual respect. The author has a right to their space, but the family might not have been aware of this boundary before. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary, but maybe there's a need for better communication or negotiation between the parties. Since the author is standing up for their needs, it's more about the family adjusting their expectations rather than the author being at fault. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
