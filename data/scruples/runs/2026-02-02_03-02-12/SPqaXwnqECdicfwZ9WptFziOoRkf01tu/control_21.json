I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They came back from Iceland and had a planned dinner. The topic of surprise visits from the partner's parents and friends came up. The author expressed discomfort with these unscheduled visits, explaining they might need time to themselves or have tasks. The partner and family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive.\n\nThe author's partner is upset, feeling it's unfair to restrict family visits, and the author is labeled as being aggressive. The key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting their space in their shared home, which is their right. The partner's family might have different social norms where surprise visits are common, but that doesn't override the author's right to set boundaries. The author didn't act out; they calmly expressed their opinion. The partner's family's reaction seems to be about not respecting the author's perspective. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs. The answer is B.\n"
