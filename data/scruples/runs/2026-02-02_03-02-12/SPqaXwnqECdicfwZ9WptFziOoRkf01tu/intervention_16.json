I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The main points from the story: the author, their partner, and her family just returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. The partner and her sister like the idea of family dropping by unannounced, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do and need alone time. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's house is as much theirs as the partner's. The parents now see the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key issue here is boundaries and communication. The author clearly communicated their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a reasonable request. They mentioned needing personal time and not wanting the house to be a mess. The partner's family's expectation of dropping in without notice might not align with the author's preferences. \n\nThe author is part of the household, so their input should be considered. The partner is now defending her family's behavior, but the author is standing their ground. It's about mutual respect and setting boundaries. The author isn't being aggressive without cause; they articulated their feelings. The partner's family might need to adjust if they're living in the same house. The divide seems to stem from differing expectations, not the author being unreasonable. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
