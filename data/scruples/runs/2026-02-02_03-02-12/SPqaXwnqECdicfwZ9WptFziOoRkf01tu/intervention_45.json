I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and sister like it, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and mentioned the house might not be in order. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the parents calling the author aggressive for finally sharing their opinion.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is about personal boundaries and privacy. They shared their feelings about unexpected guests, which is a valid concern. People have different comfort levels with spontaneity and privacy. The partner's family seems to have a different cultural or personal norm regarding unannounced visits. The author's response was to state their preferences, which is reasonable. However, the partner is upset because they feel it's unfair, implying that the family's tradition or behavior is being challenged. The author is standing up for their own needs, which is important in a relationship. The partner's family labeling the author as aggressive suggests they might not be used to someone asserting boundaries, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The key here is that the author is advocating for their own space and needs in a shared living situation, which is a legitimate stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're expressing their boundaries, which is necessary for mutual respect in any relationship.\n"
