I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests.\n\nThe author's partner and her family like to show up unannounced to each other's houses. The author, however, doesn't like this because they might have things to do and need some alone time. They expressed this by saying they don't want the house to be messy if someone arrives suddenly. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author is seen as being too opinionated.\n\nFrom my perspective, the key points are setting boundaries and mutual respect. The author is sharing their house and wants to maintain some autonomy. It's reasonable to not want people dropping by without notice. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are common, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to express their discomfort. \n\nThe argument arises because the partner is defending her family's habits, but the author is also asserting their own needs. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but now has to speak up suggests they're trying to be respectful while also standing up for themselves. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to stem from a place of defending her family's behavior, possibly not considering the author's perspective. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" makes sense because it's their shared home. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. They have a valid reason to prefer not having unexpected guests. The partner and her family might need to adjust their habits to respect the author's wishes, which is a common issue in relationships where different family dynamics meet. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
