I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The author, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. This has caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's opinion is making the partner's family upset.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is about unexpected guests. The author is not in favor of them, while the partner and her family are. The author explained their reasoning, but the partner is taking it as unfair. The author also points out that the house is theirs as much as the partner's. \n\nI think the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author expressed their discomfort, which is valid. People have different preferences regarding privacy and unexpected visits. The partner's family might be used to a more open lifestyle, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for having different expectations. \n\nHowever, the author did mention not biting their tongue as usual, which might have escalated the situation. The partner's family might feel disrespected if it's seen as a sudden change in stance. But the author also has a right to their own space and time. \n\nIt seems like a conflict of values. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially in their own home. The partner might need to understand that the author's needs are valid too. So I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
