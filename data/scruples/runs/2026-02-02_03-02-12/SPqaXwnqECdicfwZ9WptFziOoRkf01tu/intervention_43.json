I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author, their partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need personal space and time, and that the house shouldn't be in a mess if people come uninvited. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the author being labeled as aggressively opinionated.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, but wants confirmation. The answer should be A or B. \n\nTo determine this, I should consider cultural norms, communication styles, and boundaries. The author is sharing their feelings and setting boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the way they communicated it might have been abrupt. The partner's family might be used to a more open approach to hospitality. The author's house is a shared space, so their input is valid. But the conflict arises because the partner feels it's unfair, possibly because her family expects that kind of openness. The author's being \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from the fact that they didn't voice this before, so the sudden assertion of their preferences surprised the family.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't express their feelings before, bringing it up now is valid, but maybe the timing (during dinner) caused tension. The author isn't wrong for having different preferences, but maybe the delivery could have been softer. However, the core issue is about personal boundaries. Since the author owns the house as much as the partner, they have the right to their preferences. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. The key points are valid boundaries and communication, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
