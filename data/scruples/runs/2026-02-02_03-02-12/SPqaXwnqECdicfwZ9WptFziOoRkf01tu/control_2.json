I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a meal. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or want alone time and that the house should be ready for unexpected visits. This caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's opinion is labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is sharing their feelings about uninvited guests, which is a valid personal boundary. The partner's family is used to this behavior, but the author feels it's important to have control over their home. The partner is defending her family, and the author is standing their ground by saying it's their house too. \n\nBoundaries in relationships are important. The author isn't being aggressive, just stating their preferences. The problem arises from differing expectations. The partner's family might not realize the impact of their actions. The author isn't wrong for setting these boundaries. They're communicating their needs, which is healthy. The partner's family's reaction of labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" is a defense mechanism. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their space and preferences. The issue is more about the partner and her family not respecting the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
