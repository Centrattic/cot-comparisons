I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo the author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends just show up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now the partner is upset, saying it's unfair her family can't just drop by, and the author's opinion has made them seem aggressive to her parents.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to confirm. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (author isn't wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is sharing their feelings about not liking unexpected guests. They gave valid reasons: needing personal time and not wanting the house to be in disarray. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important, especially when they cohabitate. The partner's family might have different social norms, which the author is now clashing with.\n\nBut the partner is taking the author's stance as a problem, saying it's unfair. The author is standing their ground, which could be seen as necessary for maintaining personal space. On the other hand, the partner's family might feel their traditions or ways of showing affection are being dismissed.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? Maybe in the partner's family, dropping by without notice is a norm. The author is asserting their right to privacy and control over their living space. That seems reasonable. The author isn't forbidding guests entirely but is expressing discomfort with unannounced visits. The partner's frustration could stem from feeling her family's habits are being criticized.\n\nThe phrase \"aggressively opinionated\" from the parents might indicate that the author's communication style was off. Maybe they could have expressed their feelings more gently. However, the core issue is the author's right to set boundaries. Even if the delivery could be improved, the sentiment isn't inherently wrong.\n\nIn relationships, especially with blended families, it's crucial to negotiate mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for having different preferences. The partner, however, needs to recognize that her family's traditions might need adjustment when it affects her partner's comfort.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs, which is a healthy part of any relationship. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not from the author being at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
