I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about unexpected guests. The person (AITA) didn't like when their partner's parents and friends just showed up unannounced. They expressed their dislike, mentioned needing personal time and not wanting the house messy. The partner and family are upset, saying it's unfair and the AITA is now seen as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the AITA is wrong. So, the key points: the house is shared, so both the partner and their family should consider the other's preferences. The AITA is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. Everyone has the right to privacy and personal space. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the AITA is wrong to state their preferences. The partner is caught between two family expectations. The AITA's response was about respecting their space, which is valid. The family might feel entitled, but that's not the AITA's fault. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). Need to check for any nuances. The AITA didn't act out, just expressed their opinion, which is okay. The family's reaction is more about their own expectations versus the AITA's boundaries. So B.\n"
