I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests and differing opinions on that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, their partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy meal. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends often surprise each other by showing up at their houses. The author expressed that they don't like this, explaining they might have things to do, need a day to themselves, and that the house might not be clean for unexpected visitors. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair her family can't just show up, and the author is labeled as aggressive by her parents.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is setting a boundary about not liking unexpected guests, which is a common need for some people. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive. The author mentioned that they usually don't share their opinion, so this might be a first-time expression. The partner's family is reacting negatively, calling the author aggressive, but that could be because they're not used to hearing their opinion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, is the author wrong for not liking surprises? Probably not. Everyone has different preferences regarding personal space and boundaries. The issue is more about how the partner and her family perceive this. The author is standing up for their space, which is valid. However, maybe the way they communicated their feelings could be adjusted, but the core issue is about differing expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe partner might need to understand that the author's home should be a shared space where both parties' preferences are respected. The author isn't wrong for expressing a need for privacy or personal time. The family's reaction seems to stem from not being used to such boundaries. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs in a relationship where previous communication might have been avoided, leading to tension now.\n"
