I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The writer's partner and her family are used to showing up unannounced, but the writer doesn't like that. The writer expressed their discomfort, leading to a conflict where the partner and family are upset.\n\nFirst, the writer is sharing their feelings about not wanting unexpected guests. They mentioned that they might have things to do and need some alone time. That's a valid personal boundary. The partner's family is used to this behavior, but the writer is now part of the household, so they're asserting that the house is also theirs. \n\nThe key here is about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The writer didn't overreact; they just communicated their feelings. The partner and family are upset because they feel it's unfair, but the writer's right to set boundaries is important, especially in a shared living space. The writer isn't saying the family can never visit, just that they should be expected to announce themselves. \n\nThe partner's family labeling the writer as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair. The writer was calm and explained their reasons. The problem comes from the partner and family not respecting the new boundary. So, the writer isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs. The answer should be B.\n"
