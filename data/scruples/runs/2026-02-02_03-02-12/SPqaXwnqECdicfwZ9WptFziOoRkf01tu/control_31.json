I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The scenario involves their partner's family dropping by unannounced, and the author expressing discomfort with that. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their partner had just returned from a trip and planned a fancy dinner. They discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up as surprises. The author didn't like the idea, explaining they might have things to do or need alone time, and that the house should be presentable. This caused conflict because the partner felt her family shouldn't be restricted, and the author was labeled as aggressive.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is about differing social norms. The partner's family sees unannounced visits as a nice surprise, but the author finds it inconvenient. The author's stance is about personal space and boundaries. They mentioned the house is shared, so they have a right to their preferences. However, the partner and her family might feel it's about respecting their traditions or being accommodating.\n\nThe author's response was to express their discomfort, which is reasonable. They didn't make a scene but stated their reasons. The partner's family taking offense might be because they're not used to someone setting firm boundaries. The key here is whether the author overstepped by expressing their preference. Since they are cohabiting, both parties should respect each other's needs. The author isn't rejecting the partner's family completely but is asking for consideration of their own space. \n\nIt's a common conflict in relationships where in-laws have different expectations. The author's right to set boundaries isn't wrong. The partner might need to find a middle ground, like announcing visits in advance but allowing some flexibility. The author's actions don't seem to be in the wrong; they're advocating for their needs, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
