I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's partner's family expecting to show up unannounced, and the author expressing discomfort with that. The partner and her parents are upset, saying it's not fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a relationship with someone whose family has a different social norm regarding uninvited guests. The author communicated their feelings, stating they don't like unexpected visitors because they might have things to do or need alone time. They also mentioned the house being in a state if guests show up without notice. The partner and her family are upset, feeling it's unfair, and the author is labeled as aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is living in their own home, which they share with their partner. Expressing a preference about unannounced visits is a reasonable boundary. Everyone has the right to set boundaries in their own home. The partner's family might have different expectations, but that doesn't make the author wrong for stating their needs. The author isn't being aggressive; they're asserting their personal space. The partner's reaction seems to be about fairness, but fairness here could be about respecting individual boundaries versus family traditions. The author's partner might not realize that their family's actions are encroaching on the author's personal space. The author's response was direct but not hostile. It's about mutual respect and communication. Since the author isn't violating any norms or laws, just expressing their preferences, they're not in the wrong. The main issue is the clash in expectations, not the author's actions. So the answer should be B.\n"
