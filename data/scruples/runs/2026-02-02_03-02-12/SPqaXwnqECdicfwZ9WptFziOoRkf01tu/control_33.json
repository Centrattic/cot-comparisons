I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a meal at a fancy restaurant. During the conversation, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends often show up as surprises. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they might need time alone or to prepare, and that they don't want the house to be messy if someone comes unannounced. The partner and her family are now upset, with the parents labeling the author as aggressive for not keeping their opinions to themselves.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author is in a relationship and shares a home with their partner. The issue is about differing expectations regarding unannounced guests. The author's concern is valid because everyone has different boundaries. It's reasonable for someone to want privacy or time to themselves. The partner's family might see surprise visits as a sign of closeness or friendliness, but the author feels it's an intrusion. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did express their feelings, even if they usually hold back. The partner is upset because they feel their family's behavior is being criticized, and the parents think the author is being too direct. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries in their own home. However, the way they communicated might have been a factor. But the main issue is about differing norms. The author's perspective is valid. The partner and family need to respect the author's boundaries, just as the author should respect their family's traditions, but since it's the author's home, they have the right to set the rules. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
