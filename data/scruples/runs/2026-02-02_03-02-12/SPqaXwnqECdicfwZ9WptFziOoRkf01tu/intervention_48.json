I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. The key points are the disagreement over surprise visits and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's partner and her family see surprise visits as a nice gesture. The author doesn't like them because they might have plans or need time to themselves and don't want to have to clean or prepare. The partner is upset that the author isn't okay with this, and the author's family feels the author is being aggressive for expressing their opinion.\n\nI need to consider boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting their own space and preferences, which is valid. The partner and her family might be used to a different way of socializing, but that doesn't make the author wrong for having different expectations. The author is living in their own home, so it's reasonable to set boundaries about who can come in and when. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but now expressed them might be causing tension, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. They have the right to their own preferences.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the partner's family's expectations are part of their cultural or family norms. However, when someone is in a committed relationship and living with their partner, it's important to communicate and find a middle ground. The author isn't saying they can't visit, just that it should be planned. The author's concern about the house being in order is also a practical issue. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key, but so is respecting individual boundaries. The author isn't being aggressive just for having different views; they're advocating for their own needs. The partner's family's reaction seems to be about not respecting the author's perspective. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the right here. They're expressing valid concerns about their personal space and preferences. The correct answer would be B.\n"
