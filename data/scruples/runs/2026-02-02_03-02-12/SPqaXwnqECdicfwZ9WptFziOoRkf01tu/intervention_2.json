I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their partner, along with her family, just came back from Iceland and had a restaurant reservation. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends surprise each other by showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, saying they prefer to have space and not have to drop everything, and mentioned the state of the house. This led to a conflict where the partner and her family are upset, labeling the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a relationship and lives with their partner. The partner's family has a habit of unannounced visits. The author communicated their dislike for it, which the family found offensive. The author's reasoning is about needing personal space and not wanting to be interrupted, as well as being prepared for unexpected guests. The partner is defending the family's behavior, arguing it's not fair, but the author is asserting their own boundaries.\n\nNow, considering social norms and personal boundaries. It's common for people to have different expectations in relationships and family dynamics. The author is expressing their own needs, which is a valid thing to do. However, the partner's family might be used to a different way of doing things. The question is whether the author overstepped by voicing their discomfort, especially if it's a long-standing family tradition.\n\nThe author didn't act out in a mean way; they simply shared their feelings. The reaction from the partner and family seems to be more about feeling disrespected or having their habits criticized. The author's statement about the house being in a state could be seen as a concern for appearance, which is understandable. The key here is that the author is trying to set boundaries, which is their right, especially in a shared living space.\n\nThe partner's side is saying it's not fair, implying that the family's actions are normal and the author is being difficult. But the author's perspective is about mutual respect and shared space. It's a clash of different values. Since the author is just expressing their opinion and isn't being aggressive (unless the tone was off, which isn't mentioned), it's more about differing expectations rather than the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
