I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, their partner, and her family just returned from Iceland. They had a pre-booked meal at a fancy restaurant. The partner's parents and their friends drop by as surprises, which the author doesn't like. The author explained they prefer time to themselves and don't want the house to be messy for unexpected guests. Now, the partner and her family feel it's unfair, and the author is seen as aggressive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting their right to have their space and privacy, which is valid. The partner's family has their own social norms (surprise visits), but that doesn't mean the author should have to adjust if it causes them stress. The author's communication seems reasonable\u2014they explained their stance without being hostile. The partner's family might not respect those boundaries, which is on them. The author isn't in the wrong for setting limits in their own home. So, the answer is B.\n"
