I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests at their home, which is shared with their partner and her family. The main issue is the partner's family feeling that the author is being too rigid, while the author wants to have control over their own space and time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is part of a shared living space, so their home is a joint space. The partner and her family have a habit of showing up unexpectedly, which the author finds intrusive. The author's response was to state their preferences, which is a reasonable request for personal space.\n\nThe partner's family might feel that their traditions or way of socializing are being challenged. However, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially in their own home. It's common in relationships for individuals to have different social norms, and it's important to respect each other's preferences.\n\nI should also think about cultural differences. Maybe the partner's family comes from a culture where dropping by unannounced is more accepted. But the author's house is a shared space, so mutual respect is necessary. The author isn't forbidding guests entirely but is expressing a need for control over their environment, which is valid.\n\nThe partner's reaction that it's \"not fair\" might stem from not considering the author's perspective. The author's point about not wanting the house to be in disarray is practical. People have different standards for cleanliness and readiness, so expecting others to come over without notice can be stressful.\n\nThe author's approach was to communicate their feelings, which is healthy. The partner's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a defensive reaction. Expressing one's needs isn't aggression; it's about setting healthy boundaries.\n\nSo, the key points are the right to personal space, communication of boundaries, and mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior to respect the author's preferences. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
