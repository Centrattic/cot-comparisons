I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from a trip. They had a fancy dinner planned to wrap up the holiday. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister like the surprise, but the author doesn't. They expressed their discomfort, mentioning they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and that the house might not be presentable for unexpected visits. \n\nThis led to a divide. The partner thinks it's unfair the author doesn't let family show up whenever, while the author's argument is that it's their house too. The partner's family labeled the author as aggressively opinionated because they usually don't share their views around them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing their personal boundaries. It's their home, and they have the right to set rules about guests. The partner's family's behavior might be a cultural norm or family tradition, but the author's feelings are valid. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their preferences. The partner's family might not be considering the author's perspective. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't wrong for wanting to have control over their living space. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
