I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that they came back from a trip, had a meal, and discussed how the partner's family just shows up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with that, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. Living together often means compromising on personal space. The author mentioned they want some days to themselves and don't like the idea of unexpected visitors. That's a reasonable boundary. \n\nThe partner's side is saying it's not fair, but the author is asserting that the house is shared. So, the author is standing up for their own needs, which is important. However, maybe they could have approached it differently? Like discussing it privately before the dinner instead of bringing it up in front of the family. But the key point is that the author has the right to feel this way. \n\nThe partner's family is upset, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be their way of feeling defensive. The problem here is that the partner's family hasn't considered the author's perspective, assuming their own behavior is normal. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to express their feelings, which is good. It's possible they could have been more diplomatic, but their needs are valid. The partner's family's reaction seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for having this opinion. They have the right to set boundaries in their shared home. The fault might lie more with the partner's family not respecting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
