I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests, leading to tension with their partner and in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and her family just returned from a trip. They had a nice meal planned, and during the conversation, the topic came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike for this, explaining they might have things to do or need alone time, and that they don't want the house to look messy. This caused a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the author's partner's family labeling them as aggressive for finally speaking up.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The author has a right to their personal space and boundaries. It's reasonable to not want unannounced guests, especially if it disrupts their schedule or causes stress. However, the partner's family might have different social norms where unexpected visits are a way to show affection or maintain close relationships.\n\nThe conflict arises because the author finally expressed their opinion, which they usually hold back. The partner's family might feel disrespected or surprised by the sudden stance. The author's point about the house being theirs as well is valid, indicating shared ownership and responsibility.\n\nIs it fair for the author to express their boundaries? Yes. People have the right to set limits. However, how it's communicated matters. The author's tone might have come across as abrupt if they usually don't voice their opinions. But given that they explained their reasons (personal time, needing to get things done, house state), it's a legitimate concern.\n\nThe partner's perspective is that it's unfair to restrict family visits. But if the author's needs are also valid, there's a need for mutual understanding. The partner and family might need to adjust their expectations since the author is now part of the household. The author isn't wrong for asserting their preferences, especially if it affects their living space and peace.\n\nSo, considering that the author is setting healthy boundaries and the partner's family should respect them, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
