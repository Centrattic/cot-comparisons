I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests, leading to a conflict with their partner and in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author, partner, and partner's family came back from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. During the meal, the topic of unexpected guests came up. The partner and her sister liked surprises, but the author didn't. The author explained their reasons: wanting personal time and not wanting the house to be messy. This caused a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the in-laws labeling the author as aggressive.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. The author is asserting their boundaries in their own home. It's reasonable to want privacy and control over one's space. The partner's family seems to have different social norms, expecting flexibility around unannounced visits. However, the author isn't saying they can't come over at all, just that they need to be aware of the author's needs. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their preferences. The in-laws might not understand the author's perspective, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Boundaries are important, and the author has a right to them. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is being too rigid, but both parties need to find a middle ground. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
