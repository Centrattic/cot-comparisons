I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and her family returned from a trip and had dinner. They discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do and need some alone time. The partner's family is upset, feeling it's unfair, and the author is now seen as aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is stating their preferences and boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. They mentioned that the house is as much theirs as their partner's, which seems valid if they live together. The partner's family might not be respecting the author's personal space and needs, which is a common issue in blended families or when couples have different social norms.\n\nThe author's response was to express their feelings without aggression, just stating their need for alone time and not wanting the house to be messy. The partner is defending her family's behavior, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. People have different boundaries, and it's important to communicate them. The family's reaction to the author being labeled as \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from not expecting the author to set such boundaries, but that's more about the family's sensitivity than the author's wrongness.\n\nI think the author is justified in standing up for their space. It's not unreasonable to dislike surprise visits, especially if it affects personal time and the home environment. The conflict here is more about differing expectations rather than one side being clearly wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
