I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author and their partner, along with her family, just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and sister thought it's a nice surprise, but the author didn't. They mentioned they might be busy or need alone time and that they don't want the house to be unprepared. Now, the partner is upset, saying her family can't just show up whenever, and the author is labeled as aggressive for usually not sharing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are the author's right to their own preferences in their home, the partner's family's expectations, and the resulting conflict. \n\nThe author is in their own home, so it's reasonable they have a say in how it's used. Not wanting unexpected guests because they need personal time or might not be prepared is a valid personal boundary. However, the author did express this opinion in a situation where their partner's family might be used to different norms. Maybe the author could have communicated this earlier to avoid the divide. \n\nBut the partner's side is pushing back, saying it's not fair. The author's point is that the home is shared, so both sides should respect each other's preferences. The partner's family is now upset because the author usually doesn't voice opinions. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stating their preference in that context.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's statement was respectful and whether the partner's family's expectations are being considered. Since the author did state their reasons calmly (needing time for themselves, preparing the house), they aren't necessarily wrong. It's about mutual respect and setting boundaries. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if the author is part of the household now. So probably the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their preferences, and the partner's family may need to be more considerate.\n"
