I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. The topic of the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people drop by. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the parents calling the author \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for expressing their dislike of unexpected guests. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their feelings. They explained their reasons: needing personal time and not wanting the house to be in disarray. That seems reasonable. It's about setting boundaries, which is important in any relationship. People have different needs regarding personal space and time. The partner's side sees it as a cultural norm or a nice surprise, but the author's discomfort is valid.\n\nThe partner's family's reaction is to label the author as being aggressive. That might be a misunderstanding. The author didn't attack anyone; they just stated their preferences. The partner is mediating between two different viewpoints. It's possible that the partner's family isn't used to having their way challenged, so when the author speaks up, they take it as a problem.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? Maybe. Some families are more open to spontaneous visits, while others prefer planned meetings. The author's perspective is about respecting their own needs and the home environment. The partner's family might not realize how intrusive unexpected visits can be.\n\nThe key points: The author had the right to express their discomfort, especially since it's their home as well. They didn't make it about the partner's family per se but about their own needs. The partner's family's reaction seems harsh because it's a misunderstanding of boundary-setting. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their feelings, even if it caused a divide.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs in a relationship where previous boundaries might not have been clearly set. It's about mutual respect and understanding differing perspectives.\n"
