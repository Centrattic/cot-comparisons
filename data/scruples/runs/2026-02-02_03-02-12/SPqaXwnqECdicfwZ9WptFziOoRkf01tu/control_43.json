I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like this, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do, want a day to themselves, and don't want the house messy. Now there's tension because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's being called overly opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are the author's right to personal space, communication, and the partner's family's expectations. The author clearly communicated their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a reasonable request. It's important to respect boundaries in a relationship, especially when it comes to living space. The partner's family might be used to their own way, but the author's input should matter since it's their home as well. The author didn't say the family can't visit ever, just that unexpected visits are an issue. The partner's reaction and the family's labeling the author as aggressive might stem from not understanding the author's perspective. The author might not be in the wrong here because they're asserting their needs in a shared living situation. However, maybe there's a middle ground. But based on the information given, the author's stance seems valid. So the answer is B.\n"
