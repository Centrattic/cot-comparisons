I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with the partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's partner and her family are used to surprising each other by showing up unannounced. The author expresses discomfort with this, explaining that they might have things to do and need some alone time. The partner's family is upset, thinking it's unfair, and the author is labeled as being aggressive for finally sharing their opinion.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and differing social norms. The author is asserting their right to have personal space and time, which is a common and valid need. The partner's family, on the other hand, might be coming from a culture or family tradition where unannounced visits are seen as a sign of affection or spontaneity. The conflict arises when the author's boundaries clash with the partner's family's habits.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't do anything harmful; they're just stating their preference. However, they might have not communicated their boundaries earlier, leading to the family feeling blindsided. But that doesn't make the author wrong; it's more about the family not respecting the new boundary.\n\nThe partner is caught in the middle, trying to balance both sides. The author's statement about the house being their shared space is valid. They have a right to feel that way. The family's reaction of calling the author \"aggressively opinionated\" could be a defense mechanism because they're used to having their way, not considering the author's perspective.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the core is about intentions and fairness. The author's intention was to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The family's reaction is based on their unmet expectations, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
