I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong (AITA). So, the scenario is that the person and their partner's family just returned from Iceland and had a nice dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The person expressed disapproval, saying they don't like unexpected guests because they might be busy or need alone time. The partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but now there's a divide. The person said they usually don't voice their opinions around the partner's family, so now they're called aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the person is in the wrong. The key points are the person's right to their own space and boundaries versus the partner's family's expectations. The person is part of the household, so they have a right to their own preferences. It's reasonable to set boundaries about uninvited guests. The person didn't act out of malice but expressed their feelings. The partner's family might not like it, but that doesn't make the person wrong. The fact that the person usually holds back but now expressed their opinion might be seen as them finally standing up for themselves. The family's reaction is about their expectations, not necessarily right or wrong. So, the person isn't in the wrong for stating their boundaries. Answer B."
