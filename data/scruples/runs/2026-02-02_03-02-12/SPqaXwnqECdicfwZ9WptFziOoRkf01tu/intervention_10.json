I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. The main conflict arises from the author expressing discomfort with surprise visits, which the partner and her family view as a nice gesture.\n\nFirst, the author shares a personal boundary about not wanting to have unexpected guests, especially since they might have things to do or want alone time. They also mention the state of the house, which is a practical concern. The partner's family, however, sees this as being overly critical or aggressive, accusing the author of being \"aggressively opinionated.\" \n\nThe key points here are about communication and differing values. The author is asserting their right to have their home and time respected. Boundaries around personal space and unannounced visits are subjective and can vary between cultures and families. The author's partner is caught in the middle, trying to balance both her family's traditions and her partner's preferences.\n\nThe label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a sign that the partner's family is defensive or not used to having their habits questioned. The author's response was direct but not hostile; they expressed their feelings clearly. It's reasonable for someone to want to have control over their own home and schedule. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to understand and respect each other's boundaries. If the partner's family isn't willing to adjust their behavior despite the author's clear communication, the fault isn't on the author for stating their needs. However, the author should also consider if there's a way to compromise, like setting expectations with the family in advance. But based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort. The divide seems more about differing perspectives rather than the author being at fault.\n"
