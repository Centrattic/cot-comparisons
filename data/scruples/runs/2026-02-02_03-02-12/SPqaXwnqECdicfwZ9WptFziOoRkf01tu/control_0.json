I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a nice dinner planned. They discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author didn't like it, explaining they might have things to do or need alone time, and that the house might not be clean. Now there's a conflict because the partner and her family are upset, saying they can't just show up whenever, and the author is seen as being too aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is reasonable. The author is sharing their own feelings about needing personal space and not wanting unexpected guests. That's a common concern. People have different boundaries, and it's important to communicate them. The author did express their feelings directly, which is good, but maybe the way they communicated it could have been smoother. However, they were clear that the house is shared, implying that their preferences should be considered too. The partner's family might not have been aware of these boundaries before, so the author's communication is necessary for mutual respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's family might see dropping by as a friendly gesture. But the author has the right to set boundaries in their shared home. The issue here is about differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for stating their needs. The problem might be that the partner is not acknowledging the author's perspective. The key points are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their own needs. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
