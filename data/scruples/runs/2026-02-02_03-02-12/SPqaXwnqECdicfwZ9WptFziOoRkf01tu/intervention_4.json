I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They had just returned from a trip and discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced.\n\nThe author expressed their dislike for this, explaining they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and that the house shouldn't be in disarray for unannounced visits. This caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's house is considered jointly. The partner's family now sees the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, considering boundaries. The author has a right to set boundaries in their own home. If they share the house, it's reasonable to expect that both parties agree on house rules. Surprises can be stressful for some people, so the author's preference isn't unreasonable. They explained their reasons clearly: personal time and house condition. \n\nThe partner's side might see this as being too strict, but the author is asserting their needs. The family might be used to a more open policy, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to voice their opinion. The key here is mutual respect. If the author and partner can't agree on house rules, that's a communication issue between them. The author isn't being aggressive without cause; they're stating their needs. \n\nAlso, the partner's family's reaction of labeling the author as aggressive seems a bit harsh. Expressing a different opinion isn't aggression unless done in a mean way. The author seems to have a valid reason for their stance. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
