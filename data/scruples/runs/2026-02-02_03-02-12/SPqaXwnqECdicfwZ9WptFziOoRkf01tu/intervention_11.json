I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing dislike for unexpected guests in their home, which has caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just returned from a trip. They were discussing how the parents and friends of the partner's family surprise each other by showing up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need personal space, and also mentioned that the house might not be in order if people show up unannounced. This led to a divide with the partner, who thinks it's unfair, and the partner's family now sees the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. I need to evaluate if the author's stance is reasonable. \n\nKey factors to consider: The author is sharing their opinion about something that affects their living space. The home is shared, so both the author and the partner have equal claim to it. The author's right to set boundaries about uninvited guests is valid. The partner's family's expectation of being able to drop by without notice might be a cultural or personal norm, but that doesn't override the author's right to privacy and control over their home. \n\nThe author didn't say people can't come over ever, just that unexpected visits are an issue. The partner's family might not realize the impact of their actions, but the author is justified in expressing their needs. The conflict arose because the partner is defending her family's behavior without considering the author's perspective. \n\nIs there any aspect where the author might be wrong? Perhaps if the author didn't communicate this before or if there were prior agreements, but the post doesn't mention that. The author mentions that they usually bite their tongue, so this was a first-time expression. \n\nIn most cases, setting boundaries in a shared living space is reasonable. The family's reaction might stem from not being aware of the author's preferences. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their needs, even if it caused tension. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
