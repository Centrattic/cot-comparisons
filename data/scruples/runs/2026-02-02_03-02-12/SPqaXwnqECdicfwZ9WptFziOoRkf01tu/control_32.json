I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they talked about the partner's parents and their friends showing up as surprises. The partner and her sister like the idea, but the author didn't. They mentioned that they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The partner's side is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author now feels attacked for not biting their tongue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is sharing their home with their partner's family, and it's reasonable for them to have some privacy and control over their space. People have different comfort levels with social interactions. The author isn't against all visits, just the surprise ones. They made a valid point about needing personal time and not wanting the house messy. The partner's family might not respect that boundary, seeing it as a normal thing, but the author has the right to set their own limits.\n\nThe partner is caught between her family and her partner, which complicates things. The author's statement about the house being \"as much theirs as hers\" is important because it's about shared space and mutual respect. The family might not realize that the author's needs are valid, especially if they're not used to someone expressing them. The author isn't being aggressive; they're just stating their preferences. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's perspective, not because the author is wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but finally shared their feelings could indicate that they've been feeling this way for a while. It's healthy to communicate one's needs, even if it causes initial discomfort. The key is whether the author's stance is reasonable, and in this case, it seems reasonable to want to know when guests are coming so they can prepare and have personal time. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their own boundaries, which is necessary in any shared living situation.\n"
