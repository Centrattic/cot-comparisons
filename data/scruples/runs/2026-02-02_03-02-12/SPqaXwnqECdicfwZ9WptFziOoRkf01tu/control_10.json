I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves unexpected guests, specifically the partner's parents and their friends dropping by. The author explains that they're not a fan of surprise visits because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also mention that the house should be in order for guests, which is their home too.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries and differing expectations. The author's partner and her family see unexpected visits as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The author made their feelings known, which led to a divide. The partner feels it's unfair, and the in-laws now think the author is too aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if setting boundaries is wrong. In relationships, it's important to communicate needs. The author isn't against socializing but wants control over when guests come. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective before. It's common for families to have different social norms. The author is stating their side, which is reasonable. They're not being hostile, just expressing their discomfort with unscheduled visits. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a defense mechanism from the in-laws who feel their traditions are being challenged. The author isn't wrong for wanting their space and to maintain their home as they see fit. So, answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
