I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland, had a fancy dinner, and then discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed disliking this because they might have things to do and want alone time. The partner and family think it's a nice surprise, but the author's comments caused a divide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is about personal space and not wanting unannounced guests. They mentioned that they usually bite their tongue, so this was a rare moment of honesty. The partner's side is that it's unfair they can't just drop by, and now the author is seen as aggressive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did express their feelings, which is important for setting boundaries. However, the way they did it might have been abrupt, especially if it was a sudden shift from usually being agreeable. The partner's family might feel disrespected because they're used to the partner being more accommodating. \n\nBut the author is also entitled to their space. Homes are shared, so both parties have to respect each other's boundaries. The author's concern about the house being in a state is valid too. Maybe the issue is more about the partner and family not respecting those boundaries rather than the author being wrong.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The problem might be that the partner and family aren't used to those boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
