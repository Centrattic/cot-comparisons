I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not liking unexpected guests from their partner's family. The key points here are about boundaries and communication.\n\nThe author and their partner returned from a trip and had a planned dinner. They discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need personal time and that the house should be ready for visitors. The partner thinks it's unfair and the parents label the author as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, unannounced visits are common and seen as friendly. However, the author is asserting their own boundaries, which is important for personal space and privacy. The partner's family might not realize the author's perspective since they usually hold back their opinions. The author's statement about the house being \"as much theirs as hers\" indicates a valid claim to personal space in a shared home.\n\nThe partner's reaction suggests they might not be fully supportive of the author's boundaries. The divide comes from differing expectations. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting limits, which is reasonable. The partner's family's reaction to the author's honesty could be a factor in the conflict. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for expressing their feelings. They have the right to their own space and preferences. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
