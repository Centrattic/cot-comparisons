I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests.\n\nThe situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland and had a restaurant reservation. They were discussing how the partner's family and parents visit each other's houses as a surprise. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do and need some alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up unannounced. Now, the partner says it's unfair, and the author is labeled as aggressive for not usually expressing their opinions.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is setting boundaries about their own space and time, which is reasonable. People have different social norms; some like spontaneity, others prefer planning. The author isn't against the partner's family's habits but is stating their own preferences. The partner is upset because they feel it's unfair, but the author is part of the household now, so their input matters. The problem might be more about the partner's family not respecting the author's boundaries once they're communicated. The author isn't being aggressive; they're expressing their needs. The partner's family's reaction seems to be an overreaction. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
