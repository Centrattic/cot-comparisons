I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author, their partner, and the partner's family just returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained they might have things to do and want some alone time, also mentioning the house being in order. This caused a divide because the partner thinks the family should be able to show up whenever, and the author is now seen as \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is about unexpected guests. The author is expressing their dislike for unannounced visits, which is a personal boundary. The partner's family has a different cultural or personal norm where showing up without notice is considered a good gesture.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The author did express their feelings, which is important. It's not right to not share one's feelings, especially in a shared living situation. The author's partner seems to be taking the family's side, but the author is standing up for their own space. The house is shared, so the author has a right to set boundaries. The family's reaction might stem from not expecting such resistance, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nThe author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their preferences. The problem might be that the family isn't used to having their traditions questioned. The author is in a shared home, so their voice matters. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
