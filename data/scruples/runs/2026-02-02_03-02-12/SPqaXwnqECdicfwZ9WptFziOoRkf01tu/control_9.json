I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal. They discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced, which the author dislikes. The author explained they might have things to do and need personal time, and mentioned not wanting the house to be messy. This caused a divide, with the partner and family feeling it's unfair, and the author being called \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is expressing a personal preference about not wanting unexpected guests, which is a valid concern. People have different social norms, and it's common for some to value privacy and planning. The author isn't being aggressive but is stating their needs. However, the partner's family has a different cultural or personal norm of showing up unannounced. \n\nThe author's statement that the house is \"just as much theirs as it is hers\" is a reasonable assertion of shared ownership and space. The conflict arises because the partner feels the family can't just show up, but the author is standing by their own needs. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's perspective or feeling that their traditions are being challenged. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about differing expectations and communication. The author isn't in the wrong for having their own boundaries. They expressed their feelings calmly and directly, which is appropriate. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, or the couple needs to find a compromise. The author's actions don't seem unjustified. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
