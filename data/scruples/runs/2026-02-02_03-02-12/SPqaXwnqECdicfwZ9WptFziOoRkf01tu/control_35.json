I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests at their home. The author, their partner, and her family came back from a trip and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author didn't like the idea of unexpected guests, explaining they might have things to do and need personal time. The partner's family is upset, saying the author is being aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's stance is reasonable. People have different boundaries around their space. Some people are okay with surprise visits, others aren't. The author explains they need time to themselves and don't want the house to be messy. That's a valid reason. They mentioned it in a polite way, not attacking the family's habits but stating their own preferences.\n\nThe partner's side is saying it's unfair the family can't just show up. But the author is sharing their home and it's as much theirs as the partner's. So the author has the right to set boundaries. The family labels the author as aggressively opinionated, but the author just expressed their opinion once, not being aggressive. Maybe the family was used to not having their opinions challenged before, so they took it as a problem.\n\nAlso, the partner is in the middle, which can complicate things. The author might be right to stand their ground here. They're not wrong for wanting their space. The key points are mutual respect and boundaries. If the family can't respect the author's wishes, maybe they need to adjust. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs and setting boundaries in their own home."
