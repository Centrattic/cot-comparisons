I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who often visit without notice. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is part of a shared living situation with their partner's family. It's common for people to have different preferences about personal space and guests. The author's concern about needing personal time and not wanting the house to be a mess is valid. Everyone has the right to some level of personal space and autonomy.\n\nThe partner's side thinks it's okay to drop by, but the author's reaction is about their own needs. The key here is that the author communicated their feelings, albeit after usually holding back. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might indicate a sensitivity to differing opinions, which isn't fair. \n\nAlso, the house is mentioned as \"just as much mine as it is hers,\" so the author has a right to set boundaries there. The partner's family's surprise visits could infringe on the author's space. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asserting their needs. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent from the author. They're trying to communicate their boundaries, which is a healthy thing. The conflict arises from differing expectations, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
