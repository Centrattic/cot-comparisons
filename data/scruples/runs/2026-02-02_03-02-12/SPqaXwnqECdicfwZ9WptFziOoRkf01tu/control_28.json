I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When you're in a partnership, especially when living together, both parties should have a say in how the household is run. The author's main points are about needing personal time and not wanting the house to be messy when guests show up. These are valid concerns. People have different needs for personal space and privacy.\n\nThe partner's family sees unannounced visits as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. It's important to respect each other's preferences. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The term \"aggressively opinionated\" from the partner's parents seems like a mischaracterization. The author was probably trying to set a boundary, which is a healthy thing in a relationship.\n\nNow, the partner is taking the author's stance as a problem. The key here is whether the author's boundaries are unreasonable. Since they live together, the house is shared, so both should agree on guest policies. The author isn't wrong for asserting their need for personal space. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations when visiting a shared home.\n\nNo other red flags here. The author isn't being unreasonable. They're just communicating their needs. The conflict arises from differing expectations, which is common. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
