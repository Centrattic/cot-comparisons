I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think it's okay to show up unannounced, but the author doesn't like that.\n\nSo the author is sharing their house with their partner, and now there's a conflict because of the guests. The partner is on her family's side, saying it's unfair to restrict that. The author is standing their ground, saying it's their house too and they need some privacy.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is wrong. From what's described, the author has valid reasons: they might have things to do, need alone time, and don't want to be caught off guard. The partner's family is used to this, but the author isn't. The key point is that the house is shared, so both parties should respect each other's boundaries. \n\nThe partner's family labeling the author as aggressive is a red flag. Maybe they didn't handle it well, but the author's stance isn't unreasonable. Respecting personal space is important in any relationship. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
