I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and her family returned from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends drop by as surprises. The partner and her sister like it, but the author doesn't. The author expressed their dislike, mentioning they might have things to do or need alone time and that the house might not be tidy. Now, the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's opinion has led to tension, with the partner's family calling them aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is about personal boundaries. They have a right to their space and time. It's reasonable to dislike unannounced visits, especially if they have commitments or need privacy. The partner's side is about family tradition or expectations. They might see these visits as a sign of closeness and spontaneity.\n\nBut the key here is that the author owns the house equally (since it's stated as \"my house as it's hers\"). So, the author's right to set boundaries is valid. The partner's family shouldn't assume they can come over without notice. The author's statement about the house being tidy is also a practical concern; unexpected guests might find it messy, which isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe partner's reaction seems to stem from not respecting the author's boundaries once they were communicated. The author tried to be polite initially, but the partner's family is now accusing them of being aggressive. That seems unfair because the author was expressing a legitimate concern. The divide is because the partner isn't acknowledging the author's perspective equally.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did express their feelings, which is necessary. The partner's family's reaction is about their own expectations not being met, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is standing up for their rights in a shared living space. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
