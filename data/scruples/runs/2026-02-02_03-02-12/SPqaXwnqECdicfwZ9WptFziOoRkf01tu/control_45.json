I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests at their home, which has caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author went on a trip with their partner and her family. They had a fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like this, but the author doesn't. The author explained that they might have things to do and need some alone time, and also mentioned not wanting the house to look messy if uninvited guests come. This led to a divide, with the partner thinking it's unfair and the author's partner's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The question is about whether the author's stance is justified. The author has a right to their own space and preferences in their home. The partner's family's unannounced visits might be a cultural or family norm, but that doesn't mean the author can't have a different opinion. The author is asserting their boundaries, which is reasonable. The partner and her family are reacting strongly, possibly not considering the author's needs. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author isn't banning all visitors, just expressing discomfort with unexpected ones. The partner's family might not realize the impact of their actions. The author's response was honest and reasonable, not aggressive. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid perspective and are standing up for their space. The answer should be B.\n"
