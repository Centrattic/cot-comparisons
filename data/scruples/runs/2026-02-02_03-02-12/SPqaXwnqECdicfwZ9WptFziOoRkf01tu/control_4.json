I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family like to drop by each other's houses as a surprise, but the author doesn't like that. They had a pre-booked fancy dinner after returning from Iceland, and the discussion came up. The author expressed their discomfort with unexpected guests, saying they might be busy or need alone time and that the house might not be ready. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's not fair her family can't just show up, and the author is seen as aggressive for finally speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author is part of the household, so their opinion about their own space matters. It's reasonable for someone to want privacy and to have control over their home environment. The author didn't make a big deal until now but finally expressed their feelings, which the partner and in-laws are taking badly. \n\nThe partner's family's expectation of unannounced visits might be a cultural or family norm, but that doesn't negate the author's right to set boundaries. The author is sharing their home, so it's valid to have input on how it's used. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is excluding their family, but the author's stance is about personal space and respect for their own home. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Probably not. They have a legitimate reason. The partner and her family need to understand that the author's feelings are valid. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to have control over their home and personal time. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
