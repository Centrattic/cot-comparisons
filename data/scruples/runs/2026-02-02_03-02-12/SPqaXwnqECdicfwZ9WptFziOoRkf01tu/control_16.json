I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests and differing opinions between the author, their partner, and her family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal. The partner and her family think it's nice for friends and family to drop by as a surprise. The author doesn't like it, explaining they might have things to do or need alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up unannounced. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair, and the author's partner's parents labeling them as aggressive.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting their right to have alone time and not be disturbed, which is a valid need. The partner's family, on the other hand, see dropping in as a kind gesture. But the author is living in the same house, so their preferences should be considered. The partner seems to be taking her family's side, which might be part of the issue.\n\nThe author isn't being aggressive for having these feelings. They've communicated their discomfort, which is reasonable. The problem arises when the partner's family dismisses those boundaries. The author's stance isn't about rejecting family interactions entirely but about having personal space. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
