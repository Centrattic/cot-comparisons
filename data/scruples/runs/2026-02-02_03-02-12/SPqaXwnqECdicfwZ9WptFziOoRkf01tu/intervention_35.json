I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. During the meal, they talked about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced as surprises. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be in a mess if guests show up. This caused a divide because the partner feels it's unfair the author is setting boundaries, and the partner's parents now see the author as aggressively opinionated because they usually hold back their opinions. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, boundaries are important in any relationship. The author is setting a boundary about their personal space and time. It's reasonable to want some privacy or time to oneself, especially after a trip. The partner's family seems to have different expectations, which might not have been communicated before. The author's response was straightforward but not aggressive. They explained their reasons, which are valid. The partner's family might feel disrespected, but the author is also part of the household now. The fact that the author usually bites their tongue but this time had to speak up shows that it's a significant issue for them. The partner's reaction is to say it's unfair, but the author is asserting their space. The key point is whether the author had the right to express their discomfort. Since the house is shared, the author has a right to set boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
