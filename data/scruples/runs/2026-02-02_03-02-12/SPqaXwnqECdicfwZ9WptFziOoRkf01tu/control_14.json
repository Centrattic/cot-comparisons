I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they don't like unexpected guests. The scenario is that after a trip, they had a discussion about family friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author is living in a house that's shared with their partner and her family. It's important that they have a say in who comes over and when. The author's concern about having a day to themselves and needing the house to be presentable makes sense. People have different social preferences; some like spontaneity, others prefer planning.\n\nThe partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive. The key here is mutual respect. The author is standing up for their own needs, which is reasonable. The partner's reaction might stem from not considering the author's perspective before. The parents labeling the author as aggressive could be a defensive reaction, maybe because they're used to their own way of doing things.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their shared home. The issue might be more about differing expectations and communication. The author's honesty, while it caused a divide, is necessary for maintaining their well-being. So the answer should be B.\n"
