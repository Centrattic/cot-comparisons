I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests, leading to a conflict with their partner's family. \n\nFirst, the situation: After a trip, they had a reservation at a fancy restaurant. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author expressed discomfort, mentioning that they might have things to do and need some alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if guests show up unannounced. This caused a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the author labeled as aggressive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and differing social norms. The author is setting a boundary regarding uninvited guests, which is a personal preference. The partner's family is used to a different social dynamic where showing up without notice is acceptable. The author's response was direct but not confrontational, just stating their discomfort. The partner is taking it as a rejection of her family's behavior, while the author is asserting their own space in the home they share.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for having their own preferences. However, communication style might be a factor. The author usually holds back their opinions, which might have led to sudden expression being seen as aggressive. But the content of the opinion\u2014valuing personal space\u2014is reasonable. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's boundaries rather than the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their personal space and preferences, especially in a shared living situation. The conflict arises from differing social norms and communication styles, not inherent fault on the author's part.\n"
