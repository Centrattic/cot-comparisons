I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that after a trip, they and their partner went to a fancy restaurant. During the meal, they discussed how their partner's parents and their friends surprise each other at their houses. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author disagrees, explaining they might have things to do and need some alone time. The author also mentions not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up unannounced. Now, the partner's family is upset, calling the author aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is part of the household, so their home. The issue is about unannounced guests. The author expressed their discomfort, which led to conflict. The partner is defending her family's behavior, saying they can't just show up whenever. The author is now labeled as aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nFrom a boundaries perspective, the author is asserting their space. In a shared home, both partners should have input on who comes over and when. The author isn't against socializing entirely, just without notice. The partner's family might see it as a cultural or family tradition to drop by, but the author's right to privacy is valid. The partner's reaction suggests she values her family's traditions over her partner's comfort, which could be a problem. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their preference. The family's reaction to being labeled as aggressive is perhaps because they're used to being accommodated, not considering the other person's needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're setting boundaries in their own home, which is reasonable. The answer is B.\n"
