I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, leading to a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, the author explains that after a trip, they had a planned dinner. The discussion arose about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike for this, giving reasons like needing personal time and the house being in order. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. The author is in a shared home, so they have a right to privacy and personal space. The partner's family might not realize that their actions affect the author. The author's response seems reasonable\u2014they're voicing their discomfort without being aggressive, just stating their needs. The partner and family seem to be dismissing the author's feelings, thinking it's unfair. However, the author isn't wrong for wanting control over their own home and schedule. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their personal needs. The family might need to adjust their expectations, understanding that the author's home isn't just their partner's. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions makes their current stance even more about seeking balance. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their boundaries, which is healthy in any relationship.\n"
