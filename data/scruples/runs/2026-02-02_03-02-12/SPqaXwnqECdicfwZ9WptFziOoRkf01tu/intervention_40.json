I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a planned meal. The issue came up when discussing the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced.\n\nThe author expressed their discomfort with the idea, saying they might have things to do and need some alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone drops by. This led to tension because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's family now sees them as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nHmm, the key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their need for personal space and prior commitments. They didn't just say no to the guests but explained their reasoning. The partner's family might not be used to such clear boundaries, especially if the author usually keeps their opinions to themselves. \n\nThe author's perspective is about mutual respect for the home they share. If it's their house too, they have a right to set rules about unexpected visitors. The partner's family might not realize that this is a shared space and that the author has different needs. \n\nSo, the conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for expressing their needs, especially after keeping quiet before. They're trying to establish healthy boundaries. The partner and her family might need to adjust their behavior, but that doesn't make the author at fault. \n\nI think B (No) is the right answer here because the author's actions were about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The issue is more about the other party's reaction than the author being in the wrong.\n"
