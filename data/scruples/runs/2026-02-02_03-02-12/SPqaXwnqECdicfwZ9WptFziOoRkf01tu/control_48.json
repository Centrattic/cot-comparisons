I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault. The scenario involves their partner's family showing up unannounced and the conflict that arose from expressing dislike for that.\n\nFirst, the person is in a relationship with their partner, and they've returned from a trip. They had a planned meal, which is a common way to celebrate a trip. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends dropping by uninvited. The partner and her sister see this as a nice surprise, but the user doesn't. They explained that they prefer having days to themselves and not being disturbed. The user also mentioned that they don't want the house to be messy if someone drops by without notice. \n\nThe partner is upset because she feels her family can't just show up whenever. The user's response was that the house is also theirs, not just the partner's. The partner's family labeled the user as \"aggressively opinionated\" because they usually don't express their opinions around them. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms, personal boundaries, and the dynamics of relationships. In many relationships, both partners are expected to respect each other's boundaries and preferences. The user is setting a boundary about uninvited guests, which is their right. The partner's family is used to a different social norm where surprise visits are acceptable, but the user is communicating that this isn't acceptable for them. \n\nThe key points here are: the user expressed their opinion calmly, explained their reasons, and emphasized that they usually hold back their opinions to avoid conflict. The partner's family is upset not because the user expressed a preference, but because they are used to being able to come over without notice. The user is asserting their own needs in the relationship, which is necessary for a healthy dynamic. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to be about the family's expectations versus the user's boundaries. The user isn't wrong for setting these boundaries. It's reasonable to expect that in a shared living space, both partners' preferences should be considered. The user isn't being aggressive; they're being honest and seeking mutual respect. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They are standing up for their personal space and the shared home, which is a valid and necessary action in a relationship. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations, and the partner should support her partner in setting these boundaries.\n"
