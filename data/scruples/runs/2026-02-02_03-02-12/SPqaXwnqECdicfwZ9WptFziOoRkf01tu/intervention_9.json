I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal. The author doesn't like surprise visits because they might have things to do and want alone time. The partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the author expressed their discomfort. Now there's a divide because the partner is upset that the author is limiting their family's spontaneity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is part of a shared household, so they have a right to set boundaries about their personal space and time. Expressing that they need time to themselves isn't unreasonable. People have different social preferences, and it's important to respect each other's needs. The author's main point is about not wanting to be disturbed and maintaining the house's state, which are valid concerns.\n\nHowever, the partner's family might see it as being overly rigid. But the key here is that the author communicated their feelings, which is essential in any relationship. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs calmly. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" from the in-laws seems harsh because the author is just sharing their perspective. \n\nIn relationships, especially with extended family, it's crucial to have open communication. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The partner might need to mediate by explaining that the author's needs are valid and finding a middle ground, like giving advance notice before visiting. The author's stance is about mutual respect and shared living arrangements, so they are not wrong in this scenario. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
