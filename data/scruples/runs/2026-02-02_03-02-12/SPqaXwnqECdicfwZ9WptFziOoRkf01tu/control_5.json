I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. So the situation is that after a trip, the author and their partner's family had a disagreement about unexpected visits. The author expressed their dislike for surprise guests because they might have things to do and need some alone time. The partner's family is upset, saying the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a household where the partner's family often shows up without notice. The author is saying it's their house too and that they have needs. The partner is defending her family's behavior, but the author feels it's unfair. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when someone moves in with a partner, they usually have to negotiate boundaries. The author is setting a boundary here, which is reasonable. People have different social norms, so the fact that the partner's family is used to surprise visits doesn't mean it's okay if the co-resident isn't comfortable with it. The author is in a shared living space, so their opinion should matter equally. \n\nThe partner's family's reaction to being called \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding. The author expressed their feelings calmly, pointing out the need for mutual respect. The real issue might be that the family didn't consider the author's perspective before the move-in. \n\nSo the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. They have every right to expect that their time and space are respected. The partner's family needs to adjust their behavior considering the new dynamic. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
