I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family see showing up unannounced as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time. The author mentioned that the house isn't always in order and that it's their house too. The partner's family thinks the author is being aggressive for expressing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. When someone shares a home with another's family, setting boundaries about unannounced visits is reasonable. The author isn't opposing all visits but is expressing a preference for not having to deal with unexpected guests. It's important to respect each other's needs. \n\nThe partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective before. The author's response was direct but not hostile. They explained their reasons clearly. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a reaction to the author finally asserting their own needs after usually holding back. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author had valid reasons, and it's fair to expect that others respect those boundaries once communicated. The partner's side might need to adjust their expectations since they're now living in a shared space. \n\nSo, the author doesn't seem to be in the wrong. They're standing up for their personal space and needs, which is a healthy part of any relationship. The conflict arises from differing expectations, but that doesn't make the author at fault.\n"
