I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family who just returned from Iceland. They had a pre-booked fancy meal to wrap up the trip, and during the dinner, the partner and her sister talked about how their parents and friends surprise each other at their homes. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do and sometimes want a day to themselves without people showing up unannounced. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be in disarray when guests come. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author is being labeled as aggressive by the partner's parents.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is reasonable. The key points here are the author's right to their own space and the partner's family's cultural or personal norm of unannounced visits. The author is living in a shared house, so they have a valid point about it being their home too. The unexpected guests could disrupt their schedule or personal time, which is a common boundary issue in relationships. \n\nThe partner's family might have their own way of showing affection or closeness, which is different from the author's preferences. The author isn't saying it's never okay; they're just stating their dislike. The main question is whether the author's expression of preference is being taken as an attack on the partner's family. The author's comment about the house state could be seen as a practical concern rather than an emotional one. \n\nThe divide seems to stem from differing expectations about personal space and boundaries. The author isn't wrong for having their own preferences, especially in their shared living situation. The partner's family's reaction to the author being \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding or defensiveness about their own habits. \n\nI think the author is justified in setting boundaries. It's important for a relationship to respect each other's needs. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations, and the author isn't in the wrong for expressing that. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
