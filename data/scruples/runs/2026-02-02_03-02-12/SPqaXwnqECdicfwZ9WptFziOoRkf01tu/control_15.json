I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family.\n\nFirst, the author and partner returned from a trip and had a planned dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's family habit of showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining that they might have tasks or need alone time and don't want the house messy if guests appear. The partner and her family don't agree, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author is sharing their feelings about personal space and boundaries. They mentioned that the house is as much theirs as the partner's, so their input on who comes over is valid. The partner's family might see this as impolite, but the author isn't being aggressive\u2014they're setting boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's needs is important. The author isn't wrong for having different preferences. Their partner's family might not like it, but that doesn't make the author at fault. The partner is in the middle, possibly not mediating well. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have a right to their space and expressed it calmly.\n"
