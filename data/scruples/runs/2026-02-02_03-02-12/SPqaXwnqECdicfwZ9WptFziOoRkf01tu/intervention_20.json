I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, along with their partner and the partner's family, came back from a trip and wanted to have a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced at each other's houses came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. They expressed that they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves without people dropping by. They also mentioned not wanting the house to look messy if someone shows up. Now, there's a conflict because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author is being seen as too opinionated by the partner's parents.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, and wants to know if I agree. The answer should be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is normal, but in others, it's considered rude. The author's partner's family seems to be from a background where this is acceptable. The author, however, is setting boundaries, which is their right. They live in the same house, so it's reasonable for them to expect that their personal space and time is respected. The author isn't being aggressive; they're expressing their preference. The partner's family might not be used to this, so they're taking offense. The author's partner is defending her family's habits but not considering her partner's feelings. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The author is standing up for their own needs, which is healthy, especially in a relationship where both parties should respect each other's space. The partner's family's reaction of labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" suggests they're not used to having their habits questioned. However, the author isn't wrong for having different expectations. It's about differing perspectives, not necessarily right or wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have every right to set boundaries regarding their home and personal time. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, but the author isn't the one at fault here.\n"
