I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me go through the scenario again.\n\nThe author, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a booked fancy dinner. They were discussing the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people drop by. This caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's partner's family labeled them as aggressively opinionated.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about boundaries and differing expectations. The author is asserting their need for personal space and control over their home. The partner's family is used to surprising each other, which the author finds inconvenient. \n\nThe author's argument is valid because everyone has the right to their own preferences regarding their living space. It's reasonable to want to plan ahead and not have surprise guests disrupt that. The author didn't overreact; they expressed their feelings calmly. However, the partner is caught between two sides, which complicates things. The author's family might feel they're being excluded, but the author's right to their home isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe author's partner is upset because she sees the unannounced visits as a positive trait from her family, but the author is setting boundaries. The author's statement that the house is \"just as much [theirs] as it is hers\" is a valid point about shared living space. The partner's family's reaction to the author being \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from not understanding the author's perspective, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to see if the person did something objectively wrong. Here, the author is expressing their feelings and boundaries, which is appropriate. They didn't accuse anyone harshly, just explained their stance. The conflict arises from differing values, not from the author acting inconsiderately. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
