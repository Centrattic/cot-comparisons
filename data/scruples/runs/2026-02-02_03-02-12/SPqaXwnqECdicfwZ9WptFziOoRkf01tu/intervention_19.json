I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from a trip and discussed the partner's parents showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is about having personal time and space. They mentioned that they might have things to do and need a day to themselves. This is a valid point because everyone has different boundaries regarding personal space and time. The author's partner and her family see the surprise visits as nice, but the author doesn't. \n\nThe partner is upset that the author is being \"aggressively opinionated,\" but the author is asserting their right to their own home. The key point here is that the author is stating their feelings and boundaries, which is important in any relationship. The partner's family might feel that their traditions or social norms are being challenged, but the author is also part of the household now. \n\nHouse rules and boundaries should be mutual. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain some control over their living space. It's reasonable for them to express that they don't like unannounced visits, especially if it affects their ability to manage their time or keep the house in order. \n\nThe partner's reaction might stem from a place of loyalty to her family, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for having different expectations. The conflict arises from differing values\u2014improvisation vs. planning. The author's stance isn't about rejecting the partner's family but about setting clear boundaries for themselves.\n\nIn relationships, especially when merging families, communication and compromise are essential. The author isn't being aggressive; they're being honest about their preferences. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a deflection from the discomfort of having to adjust their behavior. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their personal space and needs, which is a healthy part of any relationship.\n"
