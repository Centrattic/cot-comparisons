I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author's partner and her family often have surprise visits, but the author doesn't like that. They had a disagreement after a trip where the author expressed their discomfort. Now the partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author is being called aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author has a right to their personal space and time. No one should feel pressured to allow unannounced visits if it makes them uncomfortable. The author didn't just lash out; they explained their reasons calmly, mentioning needing to do things and wanting a day to themselves. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe partner's family might be used to a different social norm where unexpected visits are common, but that doesn't mean the author has to accept it. The key here is mutual respect. The author is asserting their own needs, which is important in any relationship. The fact that the partner is taking it as unfair might mean she hasn't fully considered her partner's perspective. \n\nAlso, the author usually holds back their opinions around the family, but this time they spoke up. Being labeled as aggressive is a bit of a deflection. The author's expression of their feelings is valid. Setting boundaries isn't being inconsiderate; it's about maintaining one's own well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The partner and her family need to adjust their expectations. The answer should be B.\n"
