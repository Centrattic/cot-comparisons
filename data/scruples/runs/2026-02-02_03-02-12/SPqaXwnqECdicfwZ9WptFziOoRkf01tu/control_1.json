I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. The conversation turned to the partner's parents and friends dropping by unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they prefer time to themselves and want the house to be presentable. The partner's family now thinks the author is being aggressive, and the partner is upset about the family not being able to drop by.\n\nSo, the main issue is about boundaries and differing social norms. The author is setting a boundary about unexpected guests, which is a reasonable thing to do. People have different preferences on social interactions. The partner's family might be used to a more open, spontaneous approach, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for preferring privacy. \n\nThe partner is in the middle, trying to balance both sides. The author's reaction was straightforward\u2014expressing their dislike and explaining their reasons. The family's reaction to the author being \"aggressively opinionated\" seems a bit harsh if the author was just stating their feelings calmly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not wrong for having their own preferences. It's important in relationships to communicate boundaries. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if it's causing conflict. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're asserting their needs, which is healthy. \n\nNo one is entirely wrong here. The author isn't at fault for expressing their discomfort. The family's expectations might need to be adjusted, but the author isn't the problem. The partner might need to mediate better, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their space.\n"
