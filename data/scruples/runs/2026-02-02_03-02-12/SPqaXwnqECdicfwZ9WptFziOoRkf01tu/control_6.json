I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner had just come back from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. The discussion about the partner's parents dropping by as surprises came up. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining that they need time to themselves and that the house being in disarray is a concern. The partner and her family don't think it's fair to limit their spontaneity, leading to a divide. The author now feels labeled as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author has a right to set boundaries in their own home. Expressing that they don't like surprise visits isn't unreasonable, especially after a trip where they might be tired. The partner's family's expectation to drop by without notice might not consider the author's needs. The author isn't being aggressive; they're communicating their preferences. The partner's side is in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
