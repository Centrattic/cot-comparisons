I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, the context: They had just returned from a trip and had a meal discussing the issue. The author expressed their dislike for surprise visits, mentioning they might need alone time or to do things. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive. The partner is now upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's point about the house being shared is being dismissed. The family labeled the author as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and differing cultural or family expectations. The author is asserting their right to have their space respected, especially since it's their shared home. The partner's family might have different norms about social interactions, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries. The author's response was direct but not hostile\u2014they explained their reasons and stated their house rules. The partner's family's reaction of calling them \"aggressively opinionated\" suggests they weren't expecting the author to push back, which is their own issue. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're standing up for their own needs, which is reasonable. There's no indication the author was rude or overstepped by expressing their discomfort. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
