I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they talked about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need time to themselves, and also mentioned the house state. Now there's a conflict because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's been labeled as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is about personal space and boundaries. They mentioned having their own needs and not wanting to be bothered sometimes. They also pointed out the house state, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the partner's family sees these unannounced visits as nice surprises. But the key here is that the author is the partner's spouse, so the house is shared. The author is saying the house is as much theirs as the partner's, which makes sense. \n\nThe partner is upset that the author didn't bite their tongue, implying that the author should have kept their feelings to themselves to avoid conflict. But the author had a legitimate reason to express their discomfort. The in-laws are reacting negatively, calling the author aggressive, which might be unfair because the author is just stating their boundaries.\n\nI think it's about respecting each other's needs. The author isn't wrong for not liking unexpected guests; it's a personal preference. The partner's family might not realize that this is a boundary issue. The author isn't being aggressive; they're communicating their needs. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
