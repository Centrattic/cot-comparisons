She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author's girlfriend (gf) being friends with a coworker, Sam. The author is upset because the friend called Sam \"her boyfriend,\" even though Sam is just a coworker and not actually the friend's boyfriend. The author found out because the gf deleted messages that were visible on her Fitbit, leading him to confront her. Now he's cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his gf have a complicated history, being on and off for four years and living together for three months. Trust might be an issue. The friend, let's say the coworker (the friend in question is the girl who called Sam her boyfriend), has been friends with the gf for three years. The friend's coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to others much but interacts with the gf. The friend's message was a joke referring to Sam as \"her boyfriend,\" which the gf ignored. The author is now cutting off the friendship because he feels the friend disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main issue is the friend calling another man \"boyfriend\" in a work context. Is that really so bad? The friend might have been joking, as the author acknowledges there are innocent \"work husband\" jokes sometimes. The gf didn't engage with the joke and moved on, so maybe she already set boundaries. The author's reaction is to end the friendship over a single joke, which could be seen as overreacting. But maybe he's justified in feeling disrespected if the friend didn't respect his boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the author found out through deleted messages and used the Fitbit to uncover the messages. The gf didn't mention this herself, so maybe she didn't think it was a big deal. The author's approach is to cut off the friend without the gf's input, which might be controlling. Also, the author mentions they both go through each other's phones, which is a red flag in relationships\u2014monitoring each other's phones can lead to mistrust. \n\nThe author's justification is that the friend shouldn't refer to another man as \"boyfriend,\" but in a work setting, such terms are sometimes used humorously. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the gf didn't react to it. The author's decision to end the friendship over this seems harsh, especially since the friend's comment was a one-time joke. The author is imposing his own boundaries without considering if the friend's actions were truly disrespectful. \n\nAdditionally, the way the author found out (through deleted messages and a Fitbit) suggests that the trust issues are part of the problem. The author might be projecting his own insecurities onto the situation. Cutting off the friend without discussing it openly with his gf might not be fair. The real issue could be the author's jealousy or insecurity rather than the friend's actions. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author feels that the friend's comment is disrespectful to the relationship, he has a right to express that. However, cutting off the friendship entirely over one joke is probably excessive. Relationships require communication, and the author should have discussed his concerns with his gf first rather than making unilateral decisions. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely overreacting. The friend's action was a joke, the gf didn't engage with it, and the author's method of finding out was through invasive means. The author's response is controlling and not proportionate to the situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
