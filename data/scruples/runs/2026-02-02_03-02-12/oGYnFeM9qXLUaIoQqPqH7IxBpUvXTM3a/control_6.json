She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend\" in a message. The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, but through her Fitbit, he saw the messages. Then he told her he doesn't want her to be friends with that girl anymore because the friend doesn't respect him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend (let's call her Jane) called Sam, a coworker, her \"boyfriend.\" The author's girlfriend doesn't interact with many people at work but has a relationship with Sam. The author is upset because the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, which the author doesn't find acceptable. The author then cuts off the friendship, thinking the friend doesn't respect him.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend's message was a joke, probably, but it's using a term that the author finds offensive. The girlfriend didn't respond to it, which she says is because she ignored it. The author uses the fact that messages were deleted to pressure her into revealing them. Then, he decides to end the friendship based on one message.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to feel upset if someone is using a term that implies a relationship when there isn't one. But on the other hand, cutting off a friend over a single sarcastic or joking comment might be overreacting. The friend might not have intended it maliciously. Also, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit to read deleted messages) could be seen as invasive, even if the girlfriend was the one who deleted them.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require trust. If the author is checking the girlfriend's messages and using the Fitbit to find out what was deleted, that could indicate a lack of trust. The girlfriend might have deleted the messages out of embarrassment or to avoid the author's reaction, not because she was hiding something. The author's reaction\u2014cutting off the friend\u2014might be too harsh. The friend might have been making a joke, and the author isn't giving her a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that the friend \"doesn't respect him\" is a bit of a jump. One joke doesn't necessarily mean disrespect. The author could have addressed it with the friend directly instead of ending the friendship. The girlfriend's friend has been there for three years; ending the friendship over this might be disproportionate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be overstepping by cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. The method of finding out through invasive means also adds to the problem. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's acting on jealousy and not giving the friend a fair chance, and his methods are controlling.\n"
