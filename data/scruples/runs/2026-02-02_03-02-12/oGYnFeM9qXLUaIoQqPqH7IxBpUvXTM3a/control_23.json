She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a friend who's been calling another co-worker (Sam) her \"boyfriend\" as a joke. The author finds out through some messages that were deleted but still visible via Fitbit, and then decides that the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship, so he tells his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore.\n\nFirst, the friend called Sam \"boyfriend\" as a joke. The girlfriend says she ignored the message and moved on. The author is upset about this label being used, even if it's a joke. He's also using the fact that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else as a reason to cut off the friendship. But wait, the friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" not the author. So maybe the author is feeling jealous or insecure here.\n\nThe author says he doesn't want the friend to disrespect him or the couple, but the friend's action was directed at Sam, not the author. The girlfriend tried to explain that Sam doesn't talk to many people, just waves at her. The author is cutting off the friend over a joke that's not about him. That seems a bit extreme. Also, the author is using the Fitbit data to know about deleted messages, which might be a privacy issue, but the user mentioned not to focus on that part. However, the fact that he's monitoring her Fitbit to access messages she deleted could be another layer of manipulation or distrust.\n\nIs it fair for the author to cut off the friend just because she joked about Sam? Maybe not. The friend's action, while perhaps using a term the author finds offensive, isn't about the author's relationship. The girlfriend already addressed it by ignoring the message. The author's reaction seems more about his own insecurities or jealousy rather than a justified concern for his girlfriend's boundaries. Also, cutting off a friend over a joke without discussing it with the friend first might be a hasty decision. The friend might not have realized it was offensive, and the girlfriend might have already handled it. The author is taking away her agency in the friendship and making unilateral decisions. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is acting on his own jealousy, using a privacy-invasive method to uncover the messages, and then making a decision to end the friendship without considering the girlfriend's perspective. That makes him the asshole here. He's overreacting and not respecting her existing friendship and her way of handling the situation. The answer should be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
