She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Jane) for over three years. The author is okay with the friend because the coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people at work. But then, Jane refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which makes the author uncomfortable. He confronts the girlfriend after discovering she deleted messages, including one where Jane mentioned Sam as her boyfriend. The girlfriend claims that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else and she ignored the message. The author decides she shouldn't continue the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries. The author mentions that they've been on and off for four years and live together now. That might mean there's some history of trust issues. The fact that they check each other's phones is a red flag. Even though the girlfriend deleted messages, the author uses her Fitbit to find out. This method of checking messages might be manipulative or invasive, depending on how it's done. However, the user notes that the phone-checking isn't the main point here, so maybe I should focus on the friend situation.\n\nThe author's main issue is the friend calling Sam her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend didn't address it, and the author is upset that the friend doesn't respect their relationship. Now, whether it's appropriate to cut off a friend over that. It's a matter of perspective. Some people might see the term as a casual joke, especially if it's not meant to be taken seriously. However, the author is clearly uncomfortable with any other man being associated with his girlfriend in that way, even if it's just a friend's joke.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong to end the friendship. In relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend first, asking her to address the issue with the friend. Cutting off the friend abruptly without giving the girlfriend a chance to explain or resolve it might be seen as overreacting. On the other hand, if the author feels that the friend's behavior is disrespectful and his girlfriend isn't taking it seriously, he might feel justified in his stance.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author caught the girlfriend in the act of hiding messages. That could suggest he has a right to be concerned. However, the way he handled it\u2014using the Fitbit to find out and then deciding to cut off the friend\u2014could be problematic. Trust is important in a relationship, and if the girlfriend was trying to hide something, maybe there's an underlying issue. But cutting off a friend because someone else jokingly refers to a coworker as a \"boyfriend\" might be a bit extreme. It's a judgment call. Some might think the friend was being inconsiderate, others might see it as harmless.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to cut off the friend is based on not wanting his girlfriend to be friends with someone who doesn't respect their relationship. But is that a valid reason? If the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" is just a joke and not meant to be romantic, maybe the author is overstepping by assuming the worst and punishing the girlfriend. The girlfriend might feel that her friend isn't doing anything wrong and that the author is being controlling.\n\nIn terms of the main question: Is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the friend's actions were clearly intended to mock or disrespect the relationship, then maybe the author isn't wrong. But if it's just a casual term used without malice, then cutting off the friend might be too harsh. The girlfriend could have handled the situation by talking to her friend about how it made her feel, but the author is taking it into his own hands without that discussion. So, the author might be acting without giving the friend a chance to change her behavior or even to understand the context. That could be seen as the author being the asshole because he's making a judgment about the friend based on a single message and his own insecurities.\n\nBut wait, the author also mentioned that he believes the girlfriend should have addressed the issue with the friend. If the friend's behavior is persistent and the girlfriend isn't standing up for the relationship, then maybe the author has a point. However, in this case, it's just one instance. The author's reaction is to end the friendship entirely, which is a big step. There's also the aspect of the girlfriend deleting messages. Even if the content was innocent, the act of deleting might indicate she's hiding something, but the author's method of checking via Fitbit could be manipulative, especially if she didn't know. But the user said not to focus on the phone-checking part.\n\nSo, the core issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" for a friend. It's a common term in workplaces to refer to someone as a \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend,\" but it can be sensitive. The author's trust in the girlfriend might be shaken, but does that make cutting off the friend justified? The friend's statement could have been a mistake or a joke, but the author is taking it as a personal slight. The girlfriend didn't take the issue to her friend, and the author is now doing it for her. This could be controlling behavior, assuming he's the one to decide who she can be friends with. \n\nIn some cultures, being called a boyfriend, even jokingly, is a big deal. Others might see it as harmless. The author's reaction is valid if the term crosses a line they've agreed on. However, if they hadn't discussed boundaries beforehand, he's making a unilateral decision. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being stripped. So, the author's action in cutting off the friend might be seen as wrong because he didn't communicate his boundaries first, and then acted on them without discussing with the friend. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong, because he's overreacting by ending the friendship without first addressing it with the friend or the girlfriend in a constructive way.\n"
