She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a three-year friendship with a coworker. The author, the boyfriend, is upset because the coworker referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" and the author doesn't want the gf to continue the friendship. \n\nFirst, the key points: The gf's friend, let's call her Jane, called another coworker (Sam) her \"boyfriend.\" The gf and author had a history of on-and-off relationships and now live together. The author found out through the Fitbit messages that Jane used the term \"boyfriend\" about Sam, which the author took as disrespectful. He then told the gf to stop being friends with Jane because she doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is concerned about the friendship because of the term \"boyfriend\" used by Jane. But there's a lot to unpack here. First, the term \"work husband\" or \"boyfriend\" is often used jokingly in workplaces. It's a common way to refer to a friendly male coworker without any romantic implications. The author, however, seems to take it as a serious boundary issue. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as her boyfriend. But is using the term \"boyfriend\" in a joking way really a sign of disrespect? It's possible that Jane didn't mean anything by it and just used a term of endearment among friends. The author is taking it out of context. Also, the author's method of finding out\u2014using the Fitbit to check deleted messages\u2014could be seen as invasive, even if the gf had previously gone through each other's phones. \n\nThe gf had deleted messages, which the author discovered via the Fitbit. The author then used this as leverage to get her to confess what was deleted. This approach might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation. The author is acting on one message without considering the broader context of the friendship. Cutting off a friend over a single joke might be an overreaction. \n\nAdditionally, the author's trust in the gf was initially there because she told him that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. Now, based on one instance, he's cutting off her friendship. That might be a disproportionate response. The author is also not addressing the root of his insecurity, which might stem from the on-and-off relationship history. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable about his partner being friends with someone who uses such terms. However, the appropriate response would be to discuss boundaries with the friend rather than cutting off the friendship entirely. The author's action of ending the friendship seems harsh and might be based on misunderstanding or overreaction. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong in wanting to set boundaries, but his method and the severity of cutting off the friendship might be. However, since the question is whether he is in the wrong for not allowing the friendship anymore, the answer depends on whether his reaction is justified. Given that the term used was likely a joke and the author's approach was controlling, he might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
