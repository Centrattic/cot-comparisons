She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend (28 years old) has a co-worker friend who has been friends with her for over three years. The co-worker is Sam, a guy who doesn't talk to many people at work but waves at the girlfriend. The author was okay with this until he found out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend\" in a message. The girlfriend admitted she ignored the message and moved on. Now the author is cutting off the friend because of that comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The couple has been on and off for four years and just started living together three months ago. That makes me wonder about their current relationship status and how secure the author feels. The girlfriend's friend has been around for three years, so it's a long-standing friendship. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" but the author is in the relationship. \n\nThe author found out through the girlfriend deleting messages, and he used her Fitbit data to figure out what was deleted. Wait, the Fitbit part might not be directly relevant here, but the main point is the use of a tracking device to monitor messages. That's a bit intrusive, even if it's a wearable fitness device. However, the key issue here is the friend's comment.\n\nCalling someone a \"boyfriend\" can be a term of endearment, a joke, or a term people use for a close male friend. The author is against any \"work husbands\" or jokes about that. The girlfriend's friend might not have realized that by calling Sam \"boygirlfriend,\" it could make the author uncomfortable. The girlfriend herself might not have recognized the potential issue, or maybe she thought it was harmless.\n\nThe author is now cutting off the friend because of this one comment. Is that fair? The friend didn't mean to address the author directly, and the girlfriend didn't engage with Sam. The friend's comment was about another co-worker, Sam, not the author. But by calling the girlfriend's friend's co-worker \"boyfriend,\" maybe the friend was implying a romantic relationship, which the author finds disrespectful because he's the one in the relationship with the girlfriend. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author is not the one who Sam is the boyfriend of. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" which might be a miscommunication or a joke. The author is taking it as a personal slight, which could be a case of jealousy or insecurity. The girlfriend's friend might not have been aware that the author is in a relationship and that such a term would be inappropriate. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to end the friendship based on that one message? The friend has been in the relationship for three years, and the girlfriend claims it's been ignored. The author is using that to justify cutting off contact. But maybe the author is overreacting. The friend may not have intended to disrespect the author, and the girlfriend's friendship was already established. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't address the friend's comment, which could be a problem. The author is expecting his partner to correct such references, which is a valid point. However, the friend refers to Sam as \"boyfriend,\" not the author. So the author is conflating Sam being called a boyfriend with the friend's respect for him. \n\nThe author's actions seem a bit extreme. Instead of cutting off the friend, he might have discussed it with the girlfriend and asked her to bring it up with the friend. By doing this, he's taking away the girlfriend's autonomy in handling her friendship. The friend might not even be aware of the author's insecurities. \n\nAlso, the method of finding out about the messages (using Fitbit) could be a red flag. If the author is monitoring her phone through her Fitbit, that's a breach of privacy. Even if he didn't hack her phone, using a third-party device to track messages isn't exactly respectful. The girlfriend's deletion of messages was an attempt to maintain privacy, and the author circumventing that by using Fitbit shows he's not respecting her privacy either. \n\nSo, the author's main issue is the friend calling Sam \"boyfriend.\" But the friend isn't in the relationship with the author. The author is projecting his own boundaries onto the girlfriend's friendship, which might not be the friend's intention. The friend might have been using a colloquial term without realizing it could be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was to just ignore the message, which the author is now using as a justification to end the friendship. The author might be the one being controlling here, especially considering the history of going through each other's phones. This behavior can erode trust in the relationship. \n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about the friend using a term that refers to a romantic partner, the action of cutting off the friend is extreme. The friend's comment was about another person, and the author is overreacting by not allowing the girlfriend to maintain her friendship. Plus, the method of discovering the message involved privacy invasion, which adds to the problem. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
