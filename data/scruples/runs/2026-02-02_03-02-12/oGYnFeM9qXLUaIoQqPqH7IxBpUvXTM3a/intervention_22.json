She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been on and off for four years and have been living together for three months. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, Sam, for three years. The author initially was okay with this friend because the girlfriend said Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. \n\nThe key issue here is the friend calling another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" The author found out by seeing deleted messages via the Fitbit. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message. The author then decides the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship, and cuts her off.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment was a joke or a slip. The girlfriend didn't engage in the conversation after that, according to her. The author is taking a strong stance by cutting off the friend entirely because of one joke. \n\nBut relationships often involve boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with the term \"boyfriend\" being used for someone else, maybe discussing it with the friend would be better than cutting her off. Ending the friendship over a single joke might be too harsh, especially since the friend didn't realize it was an issue. The girlfriend might feel like her friend is being punished for a minor mistake, and the author might be overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) might have been sneaky, but the user mentioned not to focus on that. The main point is the reaction. The author decided to end the friendship without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. That could be seen as unfair. \n\nHowever, if the author feels that the friend's comment is disrespectful towards their relationship, he has a right to be upset. But cutting off the friend entirely after one instance might not be the best approach. Communication might have been more appropriate. So, maybe the author is being too harsh, hence in the wrong. \n\nBut the user's own perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe because they believe the comment was inappropriate and the friend should have known better. However, the friend might not have intended any harm, and the author's reaction is disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action might be seen as overreach. Cutting off a long-time friend over a joke, without the friend knowing it was an issue, could be seen as the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
