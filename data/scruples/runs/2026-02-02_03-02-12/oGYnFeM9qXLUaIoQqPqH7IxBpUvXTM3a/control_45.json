She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ending their girlfriend's friendship with a coworker who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this before. The issue arises when the coworker refers to another man, Sam, as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" in a message. The author found out through the girlfriend's deleted messages (detected via Fitbit) and then decided to end the friendship because the friend \"doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple.\"\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. The author is expressing jealousy over a term that might be a joke or a work-related nickname. In many workplaces, people use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as friendly nicknames without romantic implications. The author's reaction seems based on a misinterpretation or overstepping by taking a joke or casual term as a personal slight.\n\nThe girlfriend didn't confront the friend about the term, but the author is now cutting off the friendship because of it. The author is using this as a reason to end the friendship without addressing the actual issue with the friend first. Cutting off a long-term friendship over a possibly innocent joke seems harsh. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or overreacting to a situation that doesn't warrant ending a friendship.\n\nAdditionally, the author's method of finding out the deleted message (using Fitbit) and then confronting the girlfriend without discussing the issue with the friend first could be problematic. It suggests a lack of trust and open communication. The right approach would have been to address the friend directly or discuss boundaries with the girlfriend about how such nicknames are perceived.\n\nIn terms of respect in relationships, both partners should communicate their concerns. The author's immediate reaction to end the friendship without giving the friend a chance to explain or clarify might be seen as unfair. The term \"boyfriend\" in a work context might not be meant to imply anything romantic, and the author's assumption that it's a disrespect could be misplaced.\n\nSo, the author's decision to cut off the friendship based on a single message, without addressing it with the friend or considering the context, likely makes them the asshole here. They're overreacting and not allowing for the possibility of misunderstanding or innocent intent. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
