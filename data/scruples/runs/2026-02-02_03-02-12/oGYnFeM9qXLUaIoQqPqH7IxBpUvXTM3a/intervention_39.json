  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The person is a guy whose girlfriend has a friend who jokingly referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The guy found out about this through some messages that the girlfriend had deleted, which he discovered via her Fitbit. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with that friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as her boyfriend.\n\nHmm. First, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether the guy is justified in cutting off the friend over the joke. The friend called a coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the guy finds offensive. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message but said she moved on. The guy feels that the friend is disrespectful and wants the friendship to end.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider the dynamics here. The friend and girlfriend have been friends for three years, and the guy had no issue with their relationship before. The friend was just the only person the coworker interacted with, so maybe there was a friendly dynamic. The joke about \"boyfriend\" might be a work-related term or a joke among colleagues. \n\nBut the guy is now cutting off the friend because of that one message. Is that a reasonable reaction? Well, he's in a new living arrangement (3 months) and they've been on and off for four years. Maybe he's more sensitive about boundaries. However, the friend didn't make the joke as a direct jab at the guy; it's a coworker, so maybe it's just a playful term. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe she didn't take it seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's method of finding out was through snooping via the Fitbit, which might not be the healthiest approach. Even if she deleted the messages, he used her own device's lag to read them. That could indicate a lack of trust, which he claims he had. But he found out she deleted messages, which might be a red flag regardless. \n\nThe question is whether cutting off the friend over a joke is reasonable. If the joke was clearly intended to mock or disrespect the relationship, then maybe. But if it's just a playful term among coworkers, then the guy's reaction might be over the top. Also, the fact that the friend said \"boyfriend\" about a coworker could be innocent, like a work-husband role. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she considers the guy as her boyfriend and the friend's comment might have been a mistake. She didn't respond, so maybe she didn't think it was a big deal. The guy is now taking a strong stance, which could be seen as controlling if the friend's comment was minor. \n\nI think the key factors here are: the nature of the comment, the intent behind it, and the guy's reaction. If the comment was clearly meant to be disrespectful, then maybe justified. But if it's just a joke without malice, cutting off a friend seems harsh. Also, the guy's method of discovering the message through snooping might affect the perception of his actions, even if the content was a concern. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the friend's comment was genuinely disrespectful or just a joke. Since it's a coworker and the friend didn't continue the conversation, it might be the latter. Therefore, the guy might be overreacting, making him the asshole. But I'm leaning towards the answer being that he's in the wrong because cutting off a friend over a single joke, especially in a workplace context, might be too extreme unless there's a pattern of disrespect. The girlfriend might have the right to maintain her friendships unless the friend was clearly mocking their relationship.\n"
