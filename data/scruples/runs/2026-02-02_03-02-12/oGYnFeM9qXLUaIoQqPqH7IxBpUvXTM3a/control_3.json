She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a female coworker friend she's been with for over three years. The coworker, Sam, who's male, has been interacting with her, just waving and maybe some limited conversation. The author was okay with that initially because the girlfriend said Sam doesn't talk to others. Then, there's a message where the friend refers to Sam as \"your boyfriend,\" and the author found out by checking the Fitbit messages since she deleted some on her phone. The author told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore, saying she doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The girlfriend is friends with a coworker for three years, which is a long time. The coworker is male, and the friend called him \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend says was just a message she ignored. But the author is upset and wants the friendship to end. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend over this.\n\nThe key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries. The author mentions he and his girlfriend live together and have been in a relationship (on and off) for four years. The fact that they live together might imply a certain level of commitment. The girlfriend's friend using the term \"boyfriend\" could be seen as a joke, but the author takes it seriously. \n\nThe author used the Fitbit to find out the messages, even though the girlfriend had deleted her phone messages. The author might have crossed a line by invading her privacy, but he says that part isn't the main issue. The main issue is his reaction to the term \"boyfriend\" used by the friend. \n\nNow, is it reasonable for the author to be upset? If the friend referred to another coworker as the girlfriend's boyfriend, that could be confusing, even if it's a joke. The author might feel disrespected or that the friend is making assumptions about their relationship. However, the girlfriend says she ignored the message, so maybe the friend was just being playful without any ill intent. \n\nThe author is now cutting off the friendship based on one message. Is that a fair response? It depends on the context. If the friend consistently made jokes that disrespected the author or the relationship, then maybe. But this seems like a single instance. The girlfriend has a long-standing friendship, so cutting it off abruptly might be seen as overreacting. The author should have discussed his feelings with her first and given her a chance to address the issue with the friend, rather than immediately ending the friendship. \n\nAlso, the author's method of checking the Fitbit to find out deleted messages might have been a privacy invasion, even if the girlfriend didn't know. That could affect how people view his actions. While the main issue isn't about the Fitbit, it shows a pattern of possessiveness and lack of trust. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is being controlling. It's not the friend's responsibility to refer to others in a way that avoids humor, and the author should have communicated his discomfort first. Ending the friendship outright without a discussion seems extreme. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because his reaction is disproportionate and he's violating the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships.\n"
