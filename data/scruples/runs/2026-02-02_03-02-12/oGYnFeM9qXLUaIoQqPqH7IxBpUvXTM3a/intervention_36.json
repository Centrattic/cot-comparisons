She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years. The friend, Sam, is a coworker who interacts little with others but talks to the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through the Fitbit. The friend referred to another coworker as \"boyfriend,\" and the girlfriend didn't confront her. The author then told the girlfriend to cut off the friend because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the author's reaction is justified. The friend using \"boyfriend\" might be a joke or a work husband scenario, which some people consider harmless. But the author is strict about not wanting any other man to be called that in relation to their girlfriend. The girlfriend didn't address the friend's comment, which the author sees as a lack of respect.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's action could be seen as innocuous. On the other, the author is standing up for their relationship boundaries. But cutting off a friend after one incident might be too harsh. The girlfriend didn't act on the message, but the author is taking it as a personal slight against the relationship. Also, the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages, which might indicate a lack of trust. The girlfriend's friend's comment was probably meant as a joke, but the author is taking it seriously. \n\nIs the author wrong for not allowing the friendship anymore? Maybe. The friend's comment might not have been malicious, and the girlfriend didn't respond to it. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially if the friend didn't intend harm. However, the author has the right to set boundaries in their relationship. The key is whether the action was necessary. Cutting off a friend over a single joke might be a bit extreme. But if the author feels disrespected, maybe they have a point. It's a balance between relationship boundaries and the friend's intent. \n\nI think the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the friend's comment was likely a joke, and cutting off the friendship seems too harsh. The author could have discussed the issue with their girlfriend and asked for her to address it, rather than cutting off the friend entirely.\n"
