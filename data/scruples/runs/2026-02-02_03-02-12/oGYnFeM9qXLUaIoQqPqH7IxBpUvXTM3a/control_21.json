She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the main issue is the friend referring to a coworker as \"boyfriend.\" The author believes that's disrespectful and doesn't want the friendship to continue. The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years, and the friend is the only one the coworker interacts with. The author found out through some sneaky methods (checking Fitbit messages) that the friend called the coworker \"boyfriend,\" which led him to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the context: the girlfriend had mentioned before that the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk much to others but does interact with her. The friend's comment might have been a joke, but the author sees it as a serious breach of respect. However, the girlfriend didn't respond to the message and moved on, which she claims was because she didn't want to cause drama. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction is justified. On one hand, he's standing up for his boundaries in the relationship. On the other, cutting off a long-term friendship over a single joke might be too harsh. Also, the method he used to find out (checking Fitbit) could be seen as invasive, even if he didn't directly hack her phone. \n\nFriendships can be complex. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author's response of ending the friendship entirely might be disproportionate. Relationships require communication, so maybe the author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend and given the friend a chance to apologize or clarify. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might feel that her social life is being policed, which could lead to resentment. The author's trust in his girlfriend was initially present, but this incident might have shaken it. However, the way he handled it\u2014using the Fitbit to monitor her\u2014could undermine that trust.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some people find \"work husband\" jokes harmless, while others see them as inappropriate. The author's discomfort is valid, but his solution might be overreacting. The key is whether the friend's comment was a one-time joke or part of a pattern. Since the friend only said it once and the girlfriend moved on, maybe it wasn't a big issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's justified in feeling hurt, but cutting off the friend without addressing it with her first might not be the right approach. The answer hinges on whether the action was proportional and if there was an opportunity for resolution before cutting ties. The methods he used to uncover the message also add a layer of manipulation, which could make his stance less defensible.\n"
