She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over calling another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author is upset because the friend referred to another guy as her boyfriend, which the author sees as disrespectful. But the friend didn't actually confirm that the guy is her boyfriend; she just called him that in a joking manner. \n\nThe author found out through the girlfriend deleting messages, which he discovered via her Fitbit. The key point here is that the friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author is cutting off a long-term friendship over a single, possibly innocent joke. \n\nNow, relationships require trust and communication. The author's reaction is extreme\u2014ending a 3-year friendship because of a joke. The friend might not have intended any harm. The author's decision might stem from jealousy or lack of trust, but cutting off a friend over such a minor issue could be seen as overreacting. \n\nHowever, the author does have a right to feel disrespected if the friend made a joke about his partner's relationship. But the way he's handling it\u2014without discussing it with the girlfriend and the friend\u2014might be problematic. \n\nBalancing both sides: the friend's joke was inappropriate, but the author's response is cutting off a long-time friend. It's a gray area. But generally, cutting off someone over a joke without addressing it first might be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n"
