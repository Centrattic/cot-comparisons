She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a close female coworker who called another coworker (Sam) her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through some deleted messages and now wants his girlfriend to stop being friends with her coworker because of that.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, and he's expressing discomfort with a friend referring to someone else as a \"boyfriend.\" That term can be a bit ambiguous\u2014sometimes people use it jokingly or to mean a close friend, not a romantic partner. The coworker (the friend) might not have intended to disrespect the author, but the term \"boyfriend\" can be confusing, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nThe author discovered the messages through the girlfriend's Fitbit, which he mentions she didn't clean up. But he also admitted to previously allowing phone checking, which is a red flag in relationships. Trust issues and snooping can create more problems. The fact that they've been on and off for four years and just moved in together might indicate existing trust issues. \n\nNow, when the author confronts the situation, he's cutting off the friendship based on one message. The friend might not have realized the term could be offensive, and the girlfriend didn't take offense either, just ignored it. The author's response seems a bit extreme. Relationships require communication, and instead of addressing the concern with the friend, he's cutting off the friendship entirely. That might be overreacting. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (using the girlfriend's Fitbit) might not be the healthiest approach. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, the way he approached it could lead to more distrust. The friend's comment might have been innocent, and the author is making a big deal out of it without giving her a chance to explain or correct herself.\n\nIn terms of the actual situation, calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a workplace isn't inherently wrong if it's a joke. But if the author feels it's disrespectful, he should communicate that to both his girlfriend and her friend. Ending the friendship without discussion and based on a single message might not be justified. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or overly possessive, especially if the friend had no intention of disrespecting the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is acting out of insecurity and possibly mistrust. Cutting off a long-term friendship over a possibly innocent remark isn't a mature or fair response. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author's approach could damage the relationship with his girlfriend. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction is disproportionate and based on not the best methods of handling the situation.\n"
