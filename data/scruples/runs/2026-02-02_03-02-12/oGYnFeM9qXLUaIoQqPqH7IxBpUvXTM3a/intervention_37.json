She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend and her boyfriend dealing with a friend from work. The main issue is that the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend,\" which upsets the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out through some deleted messages that the friend called another guy the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend had moved on from the conversation, but he's now cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nHmm. So, the boyfriend is using the friend's comment as justification to end the friendship. But the friend might not have meant it seriously\u2014maybe it's just workplace banter. The girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, so maybe she didn't think it was a big deal. The boyfriend, however, is taking it as a personal slight against him and the relationship. \n\nBut wait, does the friend have the right to call someone else the girlfriend's boyfriend? That seems like it's crossing a line if they're not actually in a relationship. However, sometimes people use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" jokingly. If that's the case here, maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it. The boyfriend's reaction is to end the friendship, which is pretty drastic. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend discovered the message through the girlfriend's Fitbit, which she didn't know about. He used that to pressure her into telling him about the deleted messages. That's a bit of a privacy invasion, even if he got the info without hacking. Using a Fitbit's delay to get info could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt that her friend is being cut off over a joke. If the friend wasn't trying to be disrespectful but just joked around, the boyfriend's response is overly harsh. The key here is intent. If the friend's comment was innocent, then cutting off the friendship is not justified. But if the friend made a habit of it or was trying to be disrespectful, maybe it is justified. \n\nThe boyfriend also mentions that the friend is the only person the co-worker talks to, implying that the friend might have been the only connection. Ending the friendship could isolate the girlfriend at work, which might not be fair. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend should have talked to the friend first about the term before cutting her off completely. Ending a three-year friendship because of one comment seems extreme. The boyfriend might be overreacting, but he's also standing up for the relationship's boundaries. \n\nHowever, the way he found out (through deleted messages and the Fitbit) might have given him a biased perspective. The girlfriend might not think the friend was being disrespectful, so cutting off the friend without her input could be a problem. \n\nOverall, while the boyfriend's feelings are valid, the action of cutting off the friend entirely without clarification might be too harsh. The friend might not have meant harm, and the decision to end the friendship is a big step that ignores the girlfriend's own judgment of the situation. So, the author might be in the wrong for not giving the friend a chance to explain or for not considering the girlfriend's perspective more.\n"
