She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's been together with him on and off for four years and they've been living together for three months. She has a friend who's worked with her for over three years. This friend (Sam) is a co-worker who doesn't talk to many people but does interact with the girlfriend. The author initially was okay with this because his girlfriend told him it wasn't a big deal.\n\nNow, the issue comes up when the friend (let's call her the friend) refers to another co-worker, Sam, as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and he used her Fitbit to see that she had messages about Sam being called her boyfriend. He confronts her, and she says she ignored the message. The author then cuts off the friendship because he feels disrespected and doesn't want the friend to refer to another man as her boyfriend.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's reaction to the friend's comment, the girlfriend's actions in deleting messages, and the author's decision to end the friendship. \n\nFirst, the friend called another co-worker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" Is that really a big deal? In some workplaces, people might use \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as a joke. The author seems to think that's not acceptable and wants the friend to stop. However, the girlfriend didn't see the issue, as she didn't respond to the message. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the friend didn't respect him as her boyfriend. But the friend's comment was about someone else. The author is cutting off the friendship because of a joke that might be common in the workplace. Is that overreacting? Maybe. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author, just using a term of endearment that's common in some workplaces.\n\nThen there's the method the author used to find out. He used the Fitbit to see deleted messages. While the girlfriend might have given him a way to find the truth, it's a bit underhanded. The girlfriend also went through each other's phones, which isn't healthy. But the author is using that as leverage to get her to confess.\n\nSo, the author is cutting off the friend based on a friend's joke. The friend might not have known the author's boundaries. The girlfriend didn't act on it, so maybe she didn't see it as a problem. The author is taking a strict stance that his girlfriend's friend shouldn't refer to another man as her boyfriend, even if it's a joke. \n\nIs that reasonable? It depends on the couple's values. The author might be in the right if he's clear about his boundaries. However, cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author. The author should have addressed the issue with the friend or the girlfriend to clarify expectations. Instead, he decided to end the friendship unilaterally, which could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the girlfriend didn't see the comment as a problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't discuss his feelings with the girlfriend about the friend's comment but instead took drastic action. That could be the issue. He's punishing the friend for something she might not have meant to do, and he's using the girlfriend's deleted messages (which she might have done for privacy) as a reason to cut someone off. \n\nSo, the author might be overreacting. The friend's comment is a workplace joke, and the author's response is cutting off the friendship without considering the context. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not handling it more maturely and for overreacting.\n"
