She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with her interacting with coworkers, especially since she mentioned the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to many others. But when the friend refers to Sam as \"boyfriend,\" the author takes it seriously and wants the relationship to end.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The author discovered deleted messages through the Fitbit, which might not be the best way to handle things. Even though the girlfriend was the one deleting messages, the author used a somewhat sneaky method to find out. The friend's comment was a joke, but the author took it as a personal slight. \n\nNow, whether it's okay to cut off a friend over a joke. The friend might have used the term \"boyfriend\" in a lighthearted way, not intending disrespect. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, so maybe she didn't take it seriously either. However, the author is upset that the friend didn't respect their relationship by making such a comment. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the author feels that the term \"boyfriend\" is a violation of their boundaries, it's reasonable to discuss it. But cutting off the friend entirely over one joke might be a harsh reaction. The author could have talked to the friend to address the issue instead of ending the friendship without discussing it with their girlfriend first.\n\nAlso, the method of finding out the deleted messages through the Fitbit might have caused unnecessary tension. Trust is crucial in relationships, so using the Fitbit to monitor messages might be seen as invasive, even if the girlfriend was deleting them. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a right to feel uncomfortable with the term \"boyfriend,\" the way they handled the situation\u2014cutting off the friend without addressing it with them and using the Fitbit to snoop\u2014might make them the asshole. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, and cutting off a friend over a joke without discussion could be too extreme. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
