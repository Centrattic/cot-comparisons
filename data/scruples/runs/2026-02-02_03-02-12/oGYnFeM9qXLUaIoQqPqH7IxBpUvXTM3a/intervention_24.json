She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, some background: The girlfriend and this friend (let's call her Jane) have been friends for 3+ years. The author is okay with her being friends with Jane's coworker Sam, who only interacts with his girlfriend at work. Then, a message is sent where Jane refers to Sam as \"your boyfriend.\" The author finds out through the Fitbit messages that the girlfriend deleted texts. When confronted, she explains that she ignored the message. The author then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because she disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether calling another coworker \"boyfriend\" is a valid reason to cut off a friend. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly uncomfortable with any term that implies a romantic connection between his girlfriend and someone else. He might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate and a boundary violation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the friend might have been joking or using a slang term common in the workplace. The girlfriend herself didn't engage with the comment and moved on. The author is using the deleted messages as leverage, which might not be a healthy approach. Also, he's cutting off a long-time friend over one message, which could be seen as overreacting. The friend might not have intended harm, and the girlfriend had already addressed the message by ignoring it.\n\nThe author's trust in the relationship is important, but his method of enforcing boundaries through surveillance (even if she didn't know) could be problematic. The use of the Fitbit to catch deleted messages might indicate jealousy or insecurity rather than a mutual agreement on boundaries.\n\nIn some cultures or workplaces, \"work husband\" or \"boyfriend\" can be casual terms without romantic connotations. However, the author's perspective is that any such term is not acceptable. The key is whether the friend's actions were intended to be disrespectful. If it's just a joke, then the author's reaction could be too harsh. If the friend knew it would upset the author, then it's more serious.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is making a judgment call based on a single message, using covert methods to monitor his girlfriend, and cutting off a friend without considering the context or intent. That seems to put him in the wrong. The correct answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
