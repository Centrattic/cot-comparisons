She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend and the author have been together for three months but have had an on-and-off relationship for four years. The friend in question, let's call her Jane, has been friends with the girlfriend for three years. The friend's coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially because the girlfriend told him that Sam doesn't talk to others.\n\nThen, there's the issue of the Fitbit. The girlfriend deletes messages, but the author discovers that the Fitbit retains them. The inciting incident is a message where Jane refers to Sam as the boyfriend. The author confronts the girlfriend, who claims she ignored the message. The author then tells the girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because she doesn't respect their relationship. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend,\" the author found out through the girlfriend's Fitbit, the girlfriend claims she ignored it, and the author cuts off the friendship. \n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. The author might feel that the friend was being disrespectful by using the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else, which could be seen as mocking or implying something about the relationship. However, the friend might have intended it as a joke or a term of endearment among coworkers, which is common in some workplaces. The author's reaction is to end the friendship, which is a drastic step. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's actions are based on the friend's comment, but the context matters. If the friend knew they were in a relationship and still made the comment, it could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, if the friend was unaware or it was a joke, maybe the author overreacted. Also, the fact that the girlfriend had a history of deleting messages and the author used the Fitbit to find out might be a red flag for privacy issues. \n\nBut the main issue here is the author deciding to cut off the friend solely based on that one comment. Even if the author feels disrespected, cutting off a long-term friend could be harsh. The boyfriend might be overstepping by controlling who his girlfriend can be friends with based on a single joke. The girlfriend might have the right to choose her friends, especially if she didn't engage with the comment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel disrespected and might set boundaries. But cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize could be too much. The friend might not have realized the comment was offensive. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action of cutting off the friendship might be too extreme. The friend made a joke, the girlfriend didn't engage, and the author is enforcing a boundary. However, the way he found out through snooping (via the Fitbit) might undermine his position. Also, the history of going through phones could indicate trust issues on both sides. \n\nIn terms of the actual issue, it's about whether a single joke warrants ending a friendship. If the author had talked to the friend first to express his discomfort, it might have been better. Instead, he immediately cut her off. That seems hasty and possibly controlling. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
