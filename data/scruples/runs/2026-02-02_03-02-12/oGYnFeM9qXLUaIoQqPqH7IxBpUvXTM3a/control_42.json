She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years, and the author was okay with their friendship before. The main issue here is the friend referring to Sam, a male coworker who barely interacts with others, as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author feels this is disrespectful to the relationship and to him.\n\nThe girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. He then confronted her, and she explained that she just ignored the message. The author's response was to cut off the friendship because he thinks the friend doesn't respect him.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. The author is upset that the friend made a joke about another man being the girlfriend's boyfriend. It's understandable to feel disrespected, but is cutting off a long-term friend over a single comment justified? The friend might have been joking, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author's reaction seems impulsive, and he's using the deleted messages as a reason to end the friendship. Also, the author's method of finding out (via Fitbit) might have been a privacy issue, but the user isn't focusing on that.\n\nThe key points are: the friend's comment was a joke, the girlfriend didn't respond to it, and the author is cutting off a friend based on a misinterpretation. The friend might not have intended any harm. The author's reaction seems harsh and not proportionate to the situation. Relationships require communication, but cutting off a friend over a joke could be overreacting. The author is in a position of trust, but his response might be controlling. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
