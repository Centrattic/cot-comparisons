She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Jane) for three years. The coworker Sam is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The AITA found out through a Fitbit message that Jane referred to Sam as her boyfriend. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the AITA discovered this and confronted her.\n\nThe key points here are the boundaries and communication. The girlfriend didn't inform the AITA about the nickname, which he found out through deleted messages. The AITA then decided to cut off the friendship because he felt disrespected. The question is whether this reaction is justified.\n\nI need to consider if calling someone a \"boyfriend\" is a big deal. In some contexts, coworkers might use such terms jokingly, especially if they're not in a relationship. But the AITA feels it's an issue because they're a couple, and he doesn't want any male-female interactions that could be perceived as flirtatious or disrespectful. His concern is about how others perceive their relationship. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's friend didn't know the girlfriend was in a relationship with the AITA. If the girlfriend didn't correct Jane's assumption, maybe she's also at fault for not setting boundaries. But the AITA is using this as a reason to end the friendship, which might be overreacting. Cutting off a friend with a three-year history over a joke could be seen as extreme, especially without the girlfriend having a chance to address the situation with Jane.\n\nAlso, the AITA used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages, which might be an invasion of privacy. Even though he used the Fitbit trick, that's a red flag in a relationship. Trust is important, and if there's a history of checking phones, that could indicate underlying issues. The girlfriend might feel her privacy is violated, which adds to the complexity.\n\nSo, is the AITA in the wrong? He's reacting to a situation where he feels disrespected, but his method of handling it (cutting off the friend) might be too harsh. The friend's comment could be innocent, and cutting off a long-term friend without discussion might not be fair. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or overstepping, especially if the girlfriend didn't have a chance to address the friend herself. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA being in the wrong.\n"
