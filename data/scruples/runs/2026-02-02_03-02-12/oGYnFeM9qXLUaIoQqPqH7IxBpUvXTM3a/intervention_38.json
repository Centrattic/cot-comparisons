She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else her \"boyfriend.\" The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the friend until this incident. The friend refers to another coworker, Sam, as her boyfriend. The author found out through deleted messages that the friend made this comment. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, but the author is upset because the friend didn't respect their relationship.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" in a way that they find disrespectful. They told their girlfriend to stop being friends with her. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI need to consider a few points. Is it reasonable for the author to be upset about a friend calling someone else their boyfriend? Relationships can have boundaries, and maybe the author feels that term is inappropriate here. However, the friend might have just been joking or using a common workplace term. The girlfriend's response was to ignore it, which suggests it might not have been a big deal. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (checking Fitbit messages) might not be the best approach, but the user says not to focus on that. The key is whether cutting off a friend over a one-time joke is too harsh. The author is enforcing their boundaries, but relationships can vary in their tolerance for such things. \n\nSome people might argue that the friend's comment was innocent and the author is overreacting. Others might say that the term \"boyfriend\" in a workplace setting could be problematic and the author has a right to be uncomfortable. The girlfriend's trust in the author might also play a role here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's comment was the trigger, but the author's reaction of cutting off the friendship entirely could be seen as extreme. It's possible that a conversation with the friend to express the issue would have been more appropriate than ending the friendship. However, the author's perspective is that the friend doesn't respect the relationship, which is a valid feeling even if others might disagree.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, enforcing boundaries in a relationship is important. On the other, cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke might be excessive. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms. But given the context, the author's actions stem from feeling disrespected, which is a common reason for such a reaction. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
