She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend (gf) has been friends with this coworker, let's call her Jill, for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is another person who's been at the job for a while but doesn't talk to many people. The author is okay with his gf being friendly with Sam because he knows she mentioned Sam only waves at her and that he's the only one Sam interacts with. \n\nThen, the author mentions they've been on and off for four years and live together now. He found out that his gf was deleting messages, and through her Fitbit, he discovered that her friend Jill called Sam \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset because he thinks Jill is disrespecting him by referring to another guy as the boyfriend. He tells the gf he doesn't want her to be friends with Jill anymore because of this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he doesn't accept \"work husband\" jokes and doesn't want his girlfriend to be friends with someone who makes that kind of comment. He believes the friend should have told Jill not to use that term. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is it okay for the author to cut off the friend based on one message? The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" which could be a joke or a casual term. The author is taking it seriously, but if the friend didn't have malicious intent, is it fair to end the friendship over that? Also, the girlfriend might have explained to Jill that it's not appropriate, which the author is expecting. However, the author is taking matters into his own hands without giving Jill a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nAnother angle: the author found out through sneaky means (checking Fitbit messages). The girlfriend deleted the messages, thinking the author didn't know. The author used that to confront her, which might not be the healthiest approach. Maybe the issue is more about trust and communication than the specific incident. \n\nIs the author overreacting? If the friend's comment was a one-time joke, it's possible the author is being too controlling. On the other hand, if the author has boundaries about how his partner is treated, he's within his rights to express that. However, cutting off the friend entirely might be too harsh. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective: she's been friends with Jill for years, and the author is now dictating who she can and can't be friends with. That could be seen as manipulative or controlling. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author is making a decision based on a single message, using a method that involved snooping (even if through a Fitbit), and not giving the friend a chance to address the comment. This seems like he's overreacting and possibly violating his girlfriend's autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong (Answer A). However, if he's set clear boundaries and the friend's comment is a breach, maybe he's justified (Answer B). But given the context, the harshness of cutting off the friend entirely and the method of finding out, it's more likely Answer A.\n"
