She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to stop being friends with her coworker's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend has been friends with this girl for over three years. The author is okay with her being friends with the coworker Sam, but when he finds out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend\" in a message, he cuts off the friendship. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author discovered them via her Fitbit.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. It's common for people to have expectations about how their partner interacts with others. The author's issue isn't with the coworker Sam but with the friend's comment. The friend called Sam the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author believes she should have addressed it, but she didn't, so he took it upon himself to end the friendship.\n\nIs that fair? Well, cutting off a friend because of a single joke might be harsh. The friend might have been joking, and the girlfriend didn't react. The author is imposing his standards without discussing it with her first. Trust and communication are important. The author's approach seems abrupt; maybe he should have talked to the friend or given her a chance to explain or apologize instead of cutting off the friendship. Also, using the Fitbit to find deleted messages could be a breach of trust if he didn't have her consent, which might add to the complexity here.\n\nSo, the author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, but cutting off a friend based on one message without addressing it properly might be overreacting. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh action without proper communication. Alternatively, if the comment was indeed disrespectful, maybe he's justified. But given that it's a friend with a long history and the context is a coworker situation, it's more about the method than the reason. So, probably A.\n"
