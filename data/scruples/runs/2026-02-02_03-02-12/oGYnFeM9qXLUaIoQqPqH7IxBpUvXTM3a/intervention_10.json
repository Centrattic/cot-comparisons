She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The coworker, Sam, has been interacting with her at work, but the girlfriend mentioned he doesn't talk to anyone else. The author was okay with this before. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author found out through her Fitbit. The friend called another man her \"boyfriend,\" leading the author to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. Trust is important. The author might feel that the friend's comment is disrespectful, but is cutting off the friend entirely justified? The friend might not have intended harm, just a joke. The girlfriend might feel the author is overreacting, especially if they've been on and off for years. Also, the author used the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages, which could be seen as invasive. Even though the friend made the comment, the author is punishing the friend instead of addressing the issue with the girlfriend first. Maybe the girlfriend should have set boundaries with the friend herself, but the author's reaction seems harsh. Relationships require communication, and cutting off a friend over a joke might be too extreme. So, the author's decision to end the friendship might be the asshole move here.\n"
