She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend\".\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for 3+ years. The friend (let's say the friend is a girl named Jane) refers to a coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out through some messages that were deleted but visible on the Fitbit. He then tells his girlfriend to stop being friends with Jane because she doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the main points are: Is it okay for the author to cut off the friend over this? Let's break it down.\n\nThe friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found offensive. The author believes that such terms shouldn't be used even as jokes. The girlfriend didn't confront her friend about it. The author is now cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nHmm. Well, the friend's comment might be a joke or a casual term, but the author is taking it seriously. The girlfriend didn't act on it, which might be part of the problem. The author is using this as a reason to end the friendship without discussing it with the girlfriend first. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid feelings about how his partner is perceived by others. Trust and boundaries in a relationship are important. If the friend's actions make him uncomfortable, he has a right to express that. But cutting off the friend entirely without considering the friendship's history and the friend's intent could be extreme.\n\nAlso, the way he found out\u2014through deleted messages\u2014might raise questions. If the girlfriend didn't tell him, maybe there was a reason. The author might be overreacting by ending the friendship based on a single comment, especially if it's a harmless joke. The friend might not have intended any harm.\n\nBut the author's perspective is that even joking about having a \"boyfriend\" is disrespectful. That's a personal boundary. However, expecting someone to stop being friends with a long-time friend over a joke might be too harsh. It could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSo, the key factors are:\n\n1. Is calling someone a \"work boyfriend\" inherently disrespectful?\n2. Did the author handle the situation appropriately by cutting off the friend without discussion?\n3. Is it fair to end a friendship based on a single incident?\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author overstepped. If the friend's comment was a joke and not malicious, the author's reaction might be too severe. The girlfriend's lack of action could mean she didn't see it as an issue, so the author's unilateral decision to end the friendship without addressing it with her first could be the problem.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong (A) for not allowing the friendship to continue without sufficient reason, as the situation might not justify cutting off a friend over a joke. Alternatively, if the author feels his boundaries are important, maybe not (B). But generally, cutting off someone else's friend based on a single comment without the friend's perspective is usually seen as the asshole's action.\n"
