She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The friend, Sam, only interacts with her at work and waves at her, which the author was okay with before. The issue arises when the friend calls another coworker \"boyfriend\" in a message, which the girlfriend deleted but the author found out about through her Fitbit. \n\nThe author is upset because he feels the friend doesn't respect their relationship. He tells his girlfriend to stop being friends with the friend. Now, is he in the wrong? \n\nWell, the friend's comment was a joke or mistake, not an actual romantic relationship. The girlfriend didn't engage with it and moved on. The author, however, is taking it personally and cutting off the friendship because of one message. Jealousy can be normal, but cutting off a friend over a minor joke might be overreacting. Also, the girlfriend should have addressed the friend's comment, but the author is now punishing both the friend and his girlfriend for it. \n\nThe author's approach seems extreme. Instead of discussing the issue with his girlfriend and maybe talking to the friend, he's ending the friendship abruptly. That could be seen as controlling. So, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong.\n"
