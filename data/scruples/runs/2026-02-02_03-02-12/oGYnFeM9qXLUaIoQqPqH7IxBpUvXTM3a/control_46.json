She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with her co-worker anymore because the co-worker called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has been friends with this co-worker (let's say Jane) for three years. The co-worker Sam, who is described as not talking to anyone much except the girlfriend, waves at her. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted some messages, and through the Fitbit, the author found out that Jane called Sam her \"boyfriend\" in a message. The author confronted the girlfriend and now wants to cut off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in cutting off the friendship. The \"boyfriend\" comment might be a joke, as the girlfriend says she ignored it. But the author is taking it seriously. The girlfriend might not have addressed the comment because she didn't think it was a big deal. The author is upset not just about the comment itself but also because the co-worker doesn't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Jealousy is common, but cutting off a friendship entirely over a joke might be extreme. The author should consider discussing his feelings with his girlfriend instead of making a unilateral decision. However, if the girlfriend didn't address the joke when she could have, maybe she shares some responsibility for not setting boundaries. \n\nThe author's approach seems to be based on a lack of trust, especially since he resorted to checking her Fitbit messages. That might indicate deeper issues in the relationship, like trust problems or control. The act of cutting off the friend because of a single joke might be seen as overreacting. On the other hand, if the author feels disrespected and the girlfriend didn't address the issue, maybe he's justified in his feelings.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's cutting off the friendship without giving the co-worker a chance to explain or without considering the girlfriend's side, then he might be the asshole. The girlfriend's friendship shouldn't be ended over a single joke unless there's a pattern of behavior. Also, using the Fitbit to monitor messages might be a privacy issue, which could affect the judgment.\n\nSo, the author is acting out of jealousy and insecurity, but cutting off the friend might be too harsh. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A) because he's taking control of his girlfriend's friendships without considering if the situation was that serious or if there's a misunderstanding. The co-worker's comment might be a joke, and the girlfriend's response might be innocent. The author's method of finding out and his reaction could be seen as overstepping.\n"
