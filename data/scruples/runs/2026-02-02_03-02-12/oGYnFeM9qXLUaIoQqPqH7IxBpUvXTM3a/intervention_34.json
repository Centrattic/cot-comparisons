She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but waves to the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and he found out via her Fitbit that her friend referred to Sam as her boyfriend. The author then told her not to be friends with the coworker anymore because he felt disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the friend called someone else the boyfriend, which the girlfriend didn't correct. The author takes issue with that, thinking it's a boundary issue. But the friend might have just been joking or not thinking. The problem is, the friend didn't know they were in a relationship, so maybe it's an innocent mistake. But the girlfriend didn't address it, which is a problem. The author's reaction is cutting off the friend entirely. Is that too harsh?\n\nThe friend's comment was disrespectful, but maybe the appropriate response would be to talk to the friend about it rather than cutting them off. The author didn't give the girl a chance to explain or apologize. The girlfriend also didn't correct the friend, which could be a point of contention between them, but the author's immediate reaction to end the friendship might be over the top. Relationships require communication, but cutting off a friend over a joke might not be justified unless there's a pattern of disrespect. Since this seems like a one-time incident, the author's action might be too severe. So maybe he's in the wrong for not giving her friend a chance to address it. Answer A.\n"
