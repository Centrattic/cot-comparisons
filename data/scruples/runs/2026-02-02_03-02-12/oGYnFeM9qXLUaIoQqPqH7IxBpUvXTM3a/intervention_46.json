  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (presumably the guy) is upset because his girlfriend has a female coworker friend who referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend.\" The guy is cutting off the friend because he doesn't think the friend respects him or their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and this coworker (Sam) have been friends for over three years. The guy is okay with the friendship initially because the girlfriend told him Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. Then, the guy discovers that the friend called another guy the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" in a message. He found out via her Fitbit because she deleted the messages but the Fitbit lagged. He confronts her and now wants her to stop being friends with the coworker.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. So, is cutting off a friend over a joke about a coworker being called a boyfriend justified? Well, the context matters. The guy is in a relationship and feels that the friend's comment is inappropriate. He's asserting his boundaries regarding how others refer to other men in the context of his girlfriend's relationships. However, the way he found out through snooping might be an issue. Even though he used the Fitbit as a way to see deleted messages, the act of going through her phone could be seen as invasive. Also, the friend's comment might have been a joke, not a serious endorsement of the relationship. The girlfriend might not have known about the message or might have thought it was harmless. \n\nThe guy is cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. That could be harsh. Communication between the girlfriend and the friend would probably be more appropriate before taking such a drastic step. Also, the guy is not considering the longevity of the friendship. Three years is a long time, and cutting off a friend over one message might be an overreaction unless there was prior issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy has a right to feel disrespected if the friend is making jokes about his girlfriend's romantic life, especially if it involves another man. If the friend had a history of making such comments or being inappropriate, that's different. But this seems like a one-off incident. The girlfriend might not have been aware of the message, so the guy's reaction might be based on incomplete information. \n\nAnother angle: the guy's trust in his girlfriend. The girlfriend told him that she's the only one Sam interacts with at work, and he trusted her. Now, he's questioning that trust because of a friend's comment. Maybe the issue isn't just the friend's joke but his own insecurities or past experiences in the on-and-off relationship. The fact that they've been on and off for four years and live together now could mean there's underlying tension. The guy's method of confronting the issue by cutting off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend first might be the problem. He should have talked to the girlfriend and her friend to resolve the issue instead of immediately cutting the friend out.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used the Fitbit to snoop might undermine his position. Even if the friend's comment was inappropriate, the way he found out could make him look like the one in the wrong. Trust is a two-way street, and if he's invading her privacy, that could be a bigger issue than the friend's comment.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy's actions\u2014cutting off the friend based on a single message, discovered through snooping\u2014might make him the asshole here. The appropriate step would be to address the comment with the friend and the girlfriend, not immediately end the friendship. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
