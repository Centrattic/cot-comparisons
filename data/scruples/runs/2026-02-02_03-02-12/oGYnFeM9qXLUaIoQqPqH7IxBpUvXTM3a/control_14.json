She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over calling another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend and the friend have been coworkers for over three years. The author was okay with the friend waving and interacting a bit with his girlfriend, but now the friend called a male coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the author took as a joke or disrespect. The girlfriend had deleted messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit messages. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore.\n\nSo the key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The author is asserting that the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate, especially since it refers to another man. The girlfriend might have thought it was a casual term, like a \"work husband,\" which some people use jokingly. However, the author is not okay with that and wants the friendship cut off.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In a relationship, it's important for partners to communicate their boundaries. The author's reaction is based on the friend's actions, not the girlfriend's. The girlfriend didn't engage with the joke (she ignored the message), but the author is upset about the friend's choice of words. \n\nIs it reasonable to end a friendship over a casual joke? That depends. If the friend is aware of the girlfriend's relationship status and still uses terms like \"boyfriend\" to refer to someone else, that could be seen as crossing a line. But if it was a harmless joke and the friend didn't mean any disrespect, cutting off the friendship might be too harsh. \n\nThe author's method of finding out (through the Fitbit) and using that to pressure the girlfriend into deleting the friend might also be an issue. The girlfriend might feel betrayed or manipulated by the author's tactics, even if the author's intention was to protect the relationship.\n\nIn terms of the friend's responsibility, if the friend was joking and didn't realize it was a problem, the girlfriend might have the responsibility to address it with the friend instead of cutting the friendship. The author's immediate reaction to cut off the friend without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize could be seen as overreacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is within his rights to be upset if he finds the term \"boyfriend\" being used for someone else disrespectful. However, the approach taken\u2014cutting off the friend abruptly without discussion\u2014might be seen as extreme. Healthy relationships involve communication and finding solutions together, not unilateral decisions based on intercepted messages.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions might be seen as controlling or overreacting, especially given the method used to find out and the immediate decision to end the friendship. The girlfriend's friend's use of the term may not have been malicious, and the author's response lacks nuance. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
