She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another guy her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author is okay with that initially because the girlfriend told him that Sam was just friendly and not more.\n\nThen there's the issue about the friend referring to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through the Fitbit messages that the friend made that comment. The author then decides that the friend doesn't respect them as a couple and cuts off the friendship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing that. Let's break it down. The friend called another man \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as disrespectful. But is that really a valid reason to end a friendship? The girlfriend claims that she just ignored the message and moved on. She didn't correct the friend or confront her, but maybe she didn't think it was a big deal. \n\nThe author is enforcing their boundaries based on the friend's words. But the friend might not have meant anything by it. In some workplaces, people might use terms like \"boyfriend\" casually or as a joke. The author is taking it seriously, possibly overreacting. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to read deleted messages, which could be a privacy issue. Even though the girlfriend didn't know about the Fitbit, the author is using that information to make a decision. That might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected and wants their relationship to be acknowledged. They might feel that the friend is being dismissive of their relationship. However, cutting off a friend just because someone used a term that was a joke could be seen as extreme. The friend didn't do anything to harm the relationship, and the girlfriend didn't act on the comment. \n\nThe author's actions might be based on jealousy or insecurity. They're making a friend lose their job or end their friendship over a single message. It's possible that the friend didn't realize the comment could be an issue. The author should have discussed their concerns with the girlfriend first, maybe even tried to talk to the friend about it before cutting ties. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction seems a bit harsh. The friend's comment might not have been malicious, and the author didn't give her a chance to explain. Ending the friendship without addressing the issue directly could be seen as the author overstepping. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're cutting off the friend without proper communication and overreacting to a possibly innocuous comment.\n"
