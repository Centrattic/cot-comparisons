She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years, and the coworker only interacts with her. The author is okay with this initially. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and the author finds out through her Fitbit that a message from the friend referred to another guy as \"her boyfriend.\" The author then tells his girlfriend to cut off the friend because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider the key points. The friend called another coworker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The girlfriend didn't address it and just ignored the message. The author then decides the friend is disrespectful and wants to end the friendship.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be upset about this. If a friend refers to someone else as a partner without clarification, it could be seen as crossing a line, especially in a relationship. The friend might be joking, but the author isn't okay with that. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be a harsh reaction. The friend could have been unaware of the girlfriend's relationship status or was just being playful. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend, but the author is now taking action based on that. Also, the author used the Fitbit data to find out about the deleted messages, which might be a point of contention. However, the user says not to focus on the phone checking part.\n\nAnother angle: Trust and communication. The author might feel that the friend isn't respectful, but is it the author's place to dictate who his girlfriend can be friends with? Relationships require boundaries, but cutting off a friend over one incident could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is also important. If she values the friendship, the author's decision might be seen as overstepping. However, if the friend is indeed making jokes about other people as partners, maybe the author has a valid point. \n\nIn some cases, couples set boundaries about how each partner interacts with others. If the girlfriend knew this was a dealbreaker and didn't address the friend's comment, maybe the author is justified. But if the friend's comment was a one-off and the girlfriend's friend didn't know they were in a relationship, then the author might be reacting too strongly.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is making a judgment about the friend's intentions based on one message. The friend might not have realized the inappropriateness. The author's reaction is cutting off the friendship entirely, which is a significant step. While the friend's comment was problematic, the author's response might be disproportionate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's taking a harsh action without fully understanding the context and potentially overreacting.\n"
