She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through deleted messages (which he could see via the Fitbit) that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" referring to someone else. He then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with that person anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his girlfriend have been in an on-again, off-again relationship for four years and have been living together for three months. The friend in question has been a coworker for three years. The friend interacts minimally with others at work but does wave at the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially, trusting her when she said there wasn't much interaction.\n\nNow, the key issue is the friend calling another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The author feels this is disrespectful and doesn't want the friendship to continue. But is that a valid reason? Friends can have nicknames or terms they use jokingly. The girlfriend didn't engage with the message and moved on, which the author believes. However, the author is taking a hard stance because he doesn't accept \"work husbands\" or similar terms. \n\nThe author's approach seems a bit extreme. Ending a friendship over a single joke might be harsh. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend might have already addressed it by ignoring it. The author's justification is about respect for the relationship, but maybe he should have discussed boundaries with his girlfriend instead of cutting off the friend. Also, the fact that the author used the Fitbit to check deleted messages might affect how the girlfriend perceives this decision, possibly leading to trust issues. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is clear about his boundaries regarding terms like \"boyfriend,\" then the friend's use of that term does cross a line. However, the author's reaction of ending the friendship without considering the friend's intent or the girlfriend's existing relationship with her friend might be too abrupt. Perhaps a conversation with the friend to address the term would have been better than cutting her off entirely.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be overstepping by unilaterally ending a friendship that the girlfriend has had for years. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined. The author's trust in her might also be tested here if he's not allowing her to maintain her social connections based on a single instance. \n\nSo, while the author has valid feelings about the term being used, his response could be seen as controlling or not allowing his girlfriend to handle the situation as she sees fit. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not giving her the agency to decide how to address the friend's comment and by cutting off the friendship without a proper discussion.\n"
