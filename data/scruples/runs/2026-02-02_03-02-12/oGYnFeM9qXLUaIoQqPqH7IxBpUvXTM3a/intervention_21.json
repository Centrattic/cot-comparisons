She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the key points: The author's girlfriend (GF) has a friend who's been her coworker for three years. The friend referred to another guy, Sam, as her \"boyfriend,\" even though the GF claims Sam doesn't talk to anyone and the friend might not know he's not her actual boyfriend. The author found out through the GF's Fitbit messages, which she had deleted from her phone. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. The author feels that the friend's comment is inappropriate, especially since they're in a committed relationship. The GF didn't address the friend's remark, which the author sees as her not standing up for him or the relationship. However, cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke or misstep seems harsh. The friend might not have realized the context or the implications of her comment. Also, the author's method of finding out through sneaking into the Fitbit messages shows a lack of trust and transparency, which could be problematic in itself. \n\nBut the author's decision is based on his comfort and boundaries. If he feels that the label \"boyfriend\" is disrespectful, then he's entitled to that feeling. However, the response (cutting off the friend) might be an overreaction. The GF could have addressed the friend directly rather than the author taking unilateral action. \n\nIn some cultures or relationships, calling someone a \"work husband\" is common and harmless. The author might not be wrong in his feelings, but the reaction might be too extreme. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nAdditionally, the GF's deletion of messages and the author using the Fitbit to find out suggests some issues in their communication. But the main issue here is the author's decision to end the friendship. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether cutting off a friend over this is reasonable. If the friend's comment was a one-time joke and the GF didn't engage with it, the author might be overstepping. However, if the GF's friend repeatedly disrespects the relationship, then it's his right to set boundaries. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's setting boundaries for his relationship, but the method and severity of cutting off the friend might be questionable. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since people have different boundaries, but cutting off a friend over a joke could be seen as harsh, maybe he's not in the wrong but it's a close call. \n\nSo, answer B (No).\n"
