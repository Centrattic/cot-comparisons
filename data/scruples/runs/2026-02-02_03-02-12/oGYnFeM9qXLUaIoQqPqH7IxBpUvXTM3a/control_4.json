She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years. The friend refers to a male coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend,\" even though the girlfriend's boyfriend (the author) lives with her and they've been together for four years. The author found out through deleted messages and her Fitbit. He then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because he feels disrespected.\n\nSo, the main points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries. The author is upset that the friend used the term \"boyfriend,\" which he finds disrespectful. But is that a valid reason to cut off the friendship?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, using such a term could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the boyfriend is present and the term is misleading. However, the friend might have just been joking or using it casually. The girlfriend might have thought it was harmless, but the author sees it as a serious issue.\n\nThe author's approach\u2014cutting off the friend without discussing it with his girlfriend\u2014could be problematic. Relationships often involve communication and compromise. Instead of immediately cutting the friend off, discussing the issue with his girlfriend and seeing how she handles it with her friend might have been a better approach. By doing it unilaterally, he's taking control of her social life, which can lead to resentment.\n\nAlso, the method he used to find out about the messages (using her Fitbit) raises questions about privacy and trust. Even if she was hiding messages, hacking into her Fitbit might not be the healthiest way to address the issue. Trust is a two-way street, and if he's breaching her privacy, that could be a bigger issue than the friend's comment.\n\nHowever, the author does have a right to his feelings. If he feels disrespected by the use of the term \"boyfriend,\" that's valid. But the way he's handling it might be overreacting. Cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke might be excessive unless there's a pattern of disrespect.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the key factors are how he handled the situation and his respect for his girlfriend's autonomy. By cutting the friend off without discussing it, he's imposing his will on her, which can be controlling. The friend might have been just teasing, and the girlfriend might have already addressed it. The author's actions could be seen as jumping to conclusions and overstepping, which would make him the asshole.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's making a unilateral decision based on a single instance of potentially innocent behavior, and his method of finding out the information involved privacy invasion. Healthy relationships involve communication, not surveillance and unilateral decisions.\n"
