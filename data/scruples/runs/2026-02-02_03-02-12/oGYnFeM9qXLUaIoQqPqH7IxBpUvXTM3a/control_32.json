She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the friend because the coworker (Sam) only interacts with the girlfriend and others don't talk much. The girlfriend deletes messages, but the author finds out via her Fitbit that she deleted messages including one where the friend referred to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points: The author is upset that the friend called Sam the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend didn't correct the friend and ignored the message. The author now wants the girlfriend to end the friendship.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend's comment might be a joke or a work husband situation, which some people do play along with. But the girlfriend didn't address it. The author is cutting off the friend based on one message. \n\nIs cutting off a friend over a joke too harsh? Maybe. The author's trust is important, but reacting by ending the friendship entirely could be seen as overreacting. The friend might not have meant anything by it, and the girlfriend didn't engage. The author might be acting out of jealousy or insecurity. The fact that the author is using the Fitbit to check messages also shows some level of distrust. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that the friend's comment is disrespectful. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on if the reaction is disproportionate. Ending a three-year friendship over one joke might be too much. The girlfriend should maybe address it with her friend instead of the author cutting her off. The author's approach could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend the chance to correct herself.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to protect the relationship. However, the method of cutting off the friend without discussion might be too extreme. So, the author's actions could be considered wrong because they're not giving the friend the opportunity to explain or change their behavior, and it's based on a single message. The girlfriend's past behavior (deleting messages) also raises questions about trust, but the author's response might be excessive.\n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because cutting off the friend over a joke without discussion is too harsh.\n"
