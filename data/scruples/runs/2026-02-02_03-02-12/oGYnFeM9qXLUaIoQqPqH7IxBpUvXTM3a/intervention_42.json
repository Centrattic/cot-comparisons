She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the main issue is the friend using the term \"boyfriend\" to refer to Sam, the coworker, in a message that the girlfriend deleted. The author found out through checking the Fitbit messages and then decided to end the friendship. \n\nThe girlfriend and the author have been in an on-again, off-again relationship for four years and now live together. The friend in question has been a coworker for three years and is one of the few people Sam interacts with. The friend mentioned Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend claims was a joke and she moved on. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are trust and communication. The author says they trusted the girlfriend since she mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. Then, the friend's comment about Sam as \"her boyfriend\" might be seen as a joke or a slip of the tongue, but the author took it seriously and decided to end the friendship. \n\nIs it fair for the author to demand the girlfriend to stop being friends with someone because of a single joke? The author might be acting out of jealousy or a desire to set boundaries. However, cutting off a friend based on one message could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend might feel that it's her choice who she's friends with, unless there's a prior agreement about such things.\n\nAlso, the method the author used to find out about the message (through Fitbit) raises questions about privacy. Even though the girlfriend didn't know, the author's approach to handling the situation might come off as controlling. The author's reaction could be perceived as overreacting, especially if the friend's comment was innocent and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. \n\nThe on-again, off-again relationship history might indicate some trust issues. The author's decision to cut off the friend because of a term of endearment used in a joke, even if it's not the intended boyfriend, could be seen as a breach of the girlfriend's social autonomy. Unless there was a prior boundary about how friends refer to others, the author might be in the wrong by not allowing her to maintain the friendship over something trivial.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author is still maintaining that they don't want to focus on the phone-checking aspect, but it's part of the context, suggests there's more to the trust issues. The girlfriend might feel that the author is using this incident to justify control over her relationships, which could be a red flag.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not allowing the girlfriend to be friends with the coworker over a single joke and possibly overstepping by using the Fitbit to monitor messages. The reaction is overly controlling and not based on a clear agreement or serious misconduct.\n"
