She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The coworker, Sam, only interacts with her at work, and the author was initially okay with that. Now, there's a message where the friend calls Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The author then decides to end the friendship, claiming the friend doesn't respect him or the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that even if it was a joke, the term is inappropriate. He believes his girlfriend should have addressed it, and he's taking it as a personal slight. The girlfriend deleted messages, which he discovered through her Fitbit, and used that to pressure her into telling him what was deleted. He now wants the friend blocked.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be overreacting. The friend called someone else \"boyfriend\" once, and the author is ending the friendship. That seems extreme. Also, the author is using the fact that his girlfriend deleted messages (which she might do for privacy) to control her. The way he found out through her Fitbit might be invasive, even if he didn't hack her phone directly. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend's comment was likely a joke in a work environment where they might use such terms casually. The author's reaction could be controlling, as he's dictating who she can be friends with based on a single instance. Healthy relationships allow for some autonomy. So, the author's actions seem to overstep by cutting off a long-term friend without considering the context and the girlfriend's perspective. It's possible the author is being overly possessive here, which might be the wrong move.\n"
