She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over calling someone else her \"boyfriend.\" Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, Sam, for 3+ years. The author was okay with the friendship because the coworker didn't talk to anyone else at work and just waved at his girlfriend. Now, the friend sent a message calling another guy, Sam, as her \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend deleted. The author found out through her Fitbit messages and then told her to confess all the deleted messages. The girlfriend said she ignored the message, and the author is now cutting off the friend because they don't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nThe key points here are about trust, boundaries in relationships, and how to handle jealousy or insecurity. The author is upset because the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for another man, which the author finds disrespectful. But is cutting off the friend entirely a reasonable response?\n\nThe girlfriend's friend might have been joking or using a term of endearment, which is common in some workplaces. The girlfriend deleted the message, possibly to avoid conflict or because she realized it could be an issue. The author, however, is taking a strict stance against any use of the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else, even if the context is a joke or friendly. \n\nThe author's actions stem from their own feelings of insecurity, maybe not trusting the relationship fully despite past on-and-off issues. However, cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh. The friend didn't address the author directly; the term was used between the friend and the girlfriend. The girlfriend didn't correct the friend, which could be a point for the author to address, but cutting off the friend entirely without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize might be overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit messages to confront the girlfriend, which might be a breach of privacy. While the girlfriend did delete messages, the author's approach to uncovering them through her Fitbit could be seen as manipulative. The girlfriend might feel that the author is invading her privacy, which adds another layer of tension.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of immediately cutting off the friend, it might have been better for the author to discuss their feelings with the girlfriend and let her address the issue with her friend. The author's decision to end the friendship without giving the friend a chance to clarify could be seen as controlling or overly possessive, which might make them the asshole. However, his feelings of being disrespected are valid, but the response needs to be proportionate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions seem extreme. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but their response could be seen as an overreaction. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since cutting off the friend without a proper discussion might be too harsh, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong). But maybe not entirely. It's a bit of a grey area. However, the main issue is the immediate cut-off without understanding the context of the friend's message. So, the author is in the wrong for not giving the friend a chance to explain and for taking a harsh stance over a potentially innocuous joke.\n"
