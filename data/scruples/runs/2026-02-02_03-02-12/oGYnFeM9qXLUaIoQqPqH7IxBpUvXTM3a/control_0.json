She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the friend initially, trusting his girlfriend's assurance that the coworker doesn't interact much with others. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and the author discovers through her Fitbit that one of the deleted messages referred to the coworker as \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's reaction. Let's think about boundaries in relationships. Jealousy is natural, but how it's handled matters. The friend called another coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. But first, is there a cultural or situational context where \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" is common and harmless? If people in their workplace use such terms jokingly, maybe it's not malicious. The girlfriend might have considered it a friendly nickname, and she didn't act on it, just ignored the message. \n\nThe author's punishment is cutting off the friend entirely because of one message. Is that a proportionate response? The friend didn't do anything wrong except for a joke. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe the friend isn't a threat. The author is using the deleted message as a reason, but the friend's comment was about someone else, not the author himself. The author's action seems to be based on suspicion without the girlfriend's wrongdoing. \n\nAlso, the author is using the Fitbit to monitor messages, which shows a lack of trust. Even though the girlfriend deleted messages, the author's method of finding out might have been invasive. The girlfriend might feel that her privacy was violated, leading to tension. The author's main issue is not the friend's comment but the girlfriend's deletion of messages, which could indicate something deeper, but the author is focusing on the friend's joke as the reason to cut her off. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed the concern with the girlfriend first, rather than taking unilateral action. Ending a friendship over a friend's joke without consulting the girlfriend could be seen as overstepping. The author is assuming the worst about the friend's intentions without evidence beyond a single message. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's friend might not realize the term \"boyfriend\" could be an issue. It's possible she didn't intend to disrespect the author and was just using a common workplace term. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's established friendships. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are more about his insecurity or jealousy than the friend's actual behavior. Cutting off a friend over a single, possibly harmless comment without discussing it with his girlfriend is likely an overreaction. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
