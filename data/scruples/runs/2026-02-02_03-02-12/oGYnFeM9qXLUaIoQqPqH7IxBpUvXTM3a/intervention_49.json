She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being friends with a coworker, a woman named Sam, who called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The author found out via the Fitbit messages that the friend had used this term, leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend mentions another coworker as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend claims she just ignored. The author didn't like it because he sees it as a lack of respect towards their relationship. \n\nNow, is the author being reasonable? Well, in relationships, boundaries can vary. Some might see referring to someone else as a \"boyfriend\" in the workplace as a joke or an innocent term, especially if there's no actual relationship. Others might find it disrespectful. The author's reaction is to end the friendship because of this. \n\nBut here's the thing: the friend might not have intended any harm. The term \"boyfriend\" could be workplace slang or a light-hearted way to refer to a colleague they interact with. The girlfriend didn't correct the friend, which the author finds problematic, but maybe she didn't see it as an issue before. \n\nThe author's main issue seems to be about respect and how his relationship is perceived. However, cutting off a three-year friendship over a single comment might be a harsh reaction. The friend didn't do anything to the author directly; it's more about how the author interprets the friend's actions towards his girlfriend. \n\nAlso, the author discovered this through the girlfriend's Fitbit, which raises privacy issues. Even though he used the Fitbit to find out, he might have breached her trust in another way. But the user is specifically asking about the decision to end the friendship, not the privacy angle. \n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's acting out of jealousy or a desire to protect his relationship, which is understandable. But the friend's comment might not warrant cutting off the friendship entirely. It could have been a better approach to talk to the friend and address the issue rather than ending the friendship. Therefore, the author's action might be seen as overreacting. But some might argue that in a relationship, partners have the right to set boundaries. \n\nI think it's a close call. The key points are whether the author's reaction is proportionate and if the friend's comment was truly disrespectful. If the friend was just using casual language, then the author's reaction is too harsh. But if the friend was intentionally undermining the relationship, then it's justified. Since the context is a workplace with other colleagues, it's more likely a casual term. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
