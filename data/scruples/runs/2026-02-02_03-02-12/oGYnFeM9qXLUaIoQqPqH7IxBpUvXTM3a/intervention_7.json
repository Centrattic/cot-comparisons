She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for 3+ years. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to many people at work, but interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. Then, a message was sent where the friend called another coworker (Sam?) as \"her boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend deleted but the author found out through the Fitbit messages. The author then told the girlfriend to end the friendship because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" was a joke or a serious claim. The author seems to take it as a serious boundary violation. But the friend might have meant it as a work husband or a joke. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, which could indicate she didn't approve of the term. However, the author is using this as a reason to end the friendship. \n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. The author's actions seem to stem from jealousy or insecurity. However, the friend might not have intended any harm. The author is taking a drastic step by ending the friendship without directly addressing the friend or the girlfriend. Did the girlfriend have the chance to address it with the friend first? The author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Also, the fact that the author used the Fitbit to find out about the messages might indicate a lack of trust and maybe snooping, which could be part of the issue here.\n\nIs cutting off a friend over a joke acceptable? It might depend on how the term was used. If it was a recurring issue or clearly meant to imply a relationship, then maybe. But if it was a one-time joke, the author's reaction might be too harsh. Additionally, the author's method of discovering the messages through the Fitbit could be seen as invasive, which might contribute to the problem. The girlfriend deleting messages might have been an attempt to keep things private, which could be normal in some relationships but might also indicate something more serious.\n\nSo, the author is acting out of jealousy and possibly insecurity, using a one-time incident to cut off a long-term friendship. The girl might have a right to be friends with others, and the friend may not have intended any disrespect. The author's approach seems to be cutting things off without giving the friend a chance to explain or correct the behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here because the reaction is disproportionate and possibly based on mistrust.\n"
