She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend who referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for over three years. The coworker, Sam, has been at the job for three years and only interacts minimally with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this friendship because he trusted her. However, the girlfriend deleted some messages, which the author discovered via Fitbit messages. One of the deleted texts was the friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then cut off the friendship because he felt the friend disrespected him and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The friend called someone else the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as inappropriate. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author doesn't approve of \"work husbands\" and believes the friend should have known better. He's enforcing his boundaries here.\n\nBut wait, is cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke fair? The friend might have been joking, and the girlfriend already addressed it by ignoring it. The author is reacting based on something he found out through sneaky means (checking her phone via Fitbit). The method of discovery might have been invasive, even if the content was a concern. Also, the author is taking away the girlfriend's autonomy to decide how to handle the situation with her friend. \n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and overreaction. The author's trust was shaken, but cutting off a friend based on one instance might be excessive. The girlfriend might feel that the author is being overly possessive or not trusting her judgment. Also, the author's method of discovering the message (using Fitbit) might have been a breach of privacy, which could affect the validity of his reaction.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss concerns openly. The author's approach was to cut off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend or understanding the context of the joke. This could be seen as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's established friendship. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid and he has the right to set boundaries, the way he handled it\u2014cutting off the friend without discussion\u2014might be considered inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings and autonomy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
