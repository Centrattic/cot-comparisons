She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for over three years, and the author initially wasn't a problem with their friendship. The issue arises when the friend refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful. The author discovered this through some indirect means (Fitbit messages) and then decided to end the friendship.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships: the author feels that the friend's comment disrespects their relationship. But is it reasonable to cut off a long-term friend over a joke or a term that might be considered a \"work husband\"? The girlfriend claims the friend was joking, and she ignored the message. The author didn't confront the friend directly but decided to end the friendship based on a single message. \n\nThe author's approach seems a bit abrupt. They didn't give the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. Also, the method of finding out about the messages through the Fitbit might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation, even if it worked out. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling, especially since they're cutting off a friend the girlfriend has known for years over a term that's common in workplaces. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have talked to their girlfriend about their feelings first and maybe discussed how to address the friend's comment. Cutting off the friend unilaterally without giving them a chance to explain might be overreacting. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the term \"boyfriend\" could be a light-hearted joke. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend isn't directly interacting with the author, so the author's reaction could be more about insecurity or jealousy than the friend's actions. The author's trust in their girlfriend was initially okay, but now they're acting on a single message. That might not be fair, given the context provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction seems harsh and possibly disproportionate. They didn't handle it in a way that maintains the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships unless there's a valid reason to believe the friend was being genuinely disrespectful. Since the friend was just joking and the girlfriend ignored it, the author cutting off the friendship without a discussion might make them the asshole here.\n"
