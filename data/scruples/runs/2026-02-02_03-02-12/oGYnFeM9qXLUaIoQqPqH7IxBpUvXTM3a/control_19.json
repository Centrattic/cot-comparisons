She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is the boyfriend cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The boyfriend is okay with the friendship initially, trusting her. Then, a friend refers to a male coworker (Sam) as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend deletes messages, which the boyfriend uncovers through her Fitbit. He confronts her, and she claims she ignored the message. The boyfriend then decides to end the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nThe key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction is based on the friend's comment, which he sees as a lack of respect. However, the friend might not have intended anything malicious\u2014maybe it was a joke or a term of endearment. The boyfriend is enforcing a strict boundary that the friend might not have realized was an issue. \n\nBut is cutting off a friend over a single joke or term too harsh? The girlfriend didn't act on the comment and moved past it. The boyfriend's response seems extreme, especially since the friend might not have known the term was offensive. However, the boyfriend has the right to set boundaries in his relationship. The problem is whether his reaction is proportionate. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend used the Fitbit to monitor her, which might be a red flag. Even if he discovered the deleted messages through this method, it complicates the situation. Trust is a two-way street, and if the boyfriend is suspicious and monitoring, that could contribute to the tension.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe discussing the issue and setting clear expectations with the friend would be a better approach. Ending a three-year friendship over one incidence might be too much. The author's action could be seen as controlling or overreacting, hence possibly being in the wrong (A). But if he's standing up for his relationship boundaries, then maybe not (B). \n\nConsidering all factors, the boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. The friend's comment might not justify cutting off the friendship, especially without addressing it directly. The author is likely in the wrong for overreacting and not communicating properly.\n"
