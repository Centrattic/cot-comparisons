She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a long-time friend at work, and the author (the boyfriend) is upset because the friend called another co-worker the gf's \"boyfriend.\" The author then decides the gf shouldn't be friends with this person anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author found out the friend referred to another guy as the gf's \"boyfriend\" and took it as a sign of disrespect. The gf had a history of deleting messages, which the author discovered through her Fitbit. The author confronts her, and then cuts off the friendship because of the joke.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In many relationships, partners have different boundaries about what they're comfortable with regarding friends. The author feels disrespected by the friend's comment and is upset that the gf didn't address it. On the other hand, the friend might have thought it was a harmless joke. The author is taking a strong stance, cutting off the friendship entirely based on one message.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the couple is in a committed relationship. However, the way the author handled it\u2014cutting off the friend without discussing it with the gf first\u2014might be problematic. The author's approach might be too harsh, but the friend's action might be disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out about the deleted messages through the Fitbit complicates things. Using this as leverage to pressure the gf into confessing could be seen as manipulative. Even if the friend's message was inappropriate, the author's response might be overly punitive. In relationships, communication is key, but the author seems to take unilateral action without considering the gf's perspective or the context of the friend's comment.\n\nSo, while the friend's comment was likely an issue, the author's reaction might be disproportionate. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The author's decision to end the friendship without discussing it thoroughly with his gf could be the part where he's in the wrong. He's making a judgment based on a single instance without considering other factors, like whether the friend intended harm or if the gf and friend have resolved it. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
