She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend refers to a male coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend,\" even though the girlfriend's partner (the author) isn't Sam. The author found out through deleted messages and a Fitbit message. He then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with the friend because he feels disrespected and the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. The author is upset and wants the friendship to end. But is that justified?\n\nThe friend might have just been joking or using a term colloquially, not meaning to disrespect the author's relationship. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, and the friend might not have intended any harm. The author's reaction is cutting off the friend entirely. That's a significant step. \n\nJealousy is a common issue, but cutting off a friend over a joke or a term could be harsh. The friend didn't say anything to the author directly, and the girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it either. The author's decision seems to be based on a single message, even if it was a joke. \n\nAlso, the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to read deleted messages, which could be seen as violating trust, even if he didn't hack the phone. The fact that he found out through her Fitbit might influence his judgment. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend first, maybe talk to the friend about the term instead of cutting her off. Ending a three-year friendship over one incident might be an overreaction unless there's a pattern of disrespect. \n\nSo, the author is acting out of jealousy but not necessarily in the wrong because he has the right to feel disrespected. However, cutting off the friend without addressing the issue directly might be the wrong approach. The answer might depend on whether the friend's comment was malicious or innocent. If it's the latter, the author is in the wrong for overreacting. If the term was meant to mock their relationship, then maybe not. But since the friend didn't intend harm and the girlfriend already addressed it, the author's reaction is too extreme. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he cut off the friend without proper communication and overreacted.\n"
