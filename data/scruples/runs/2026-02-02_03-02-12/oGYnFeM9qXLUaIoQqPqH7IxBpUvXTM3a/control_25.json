She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who has a friend at work, and the author (the boyfriend) is upset because the friend called another coworker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author is cutting off the friend because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend, Sam, only interacts with the girlfriend at work. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author found out by checking her Fitbit. One of the deleted messages had the friend referring to Sam as the girlfriend's boyfriend. The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nNow, the author is asking if he's the asshole for cutting off the friend. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The friend called someone else the girlfriend's boyfriend. The author is taking this as a personal slight. But is that reasonable? The girlfriend might not see the friend's comment as a big deal. The author is using that as a reason to end the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting. Also, the girlfriend mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else, which might mean the friend is just joking or using casual terms common in the workplace. The author might be projecting his own insecurities or jealousy here.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of trust. The author found out the girlfriend was deleting messages, which might indicate she felt the need to hide something. But the author used a Fitbit to find out, which could be considered invasive. The author's method of checking her messages without her knowledge might be problematic. But the actual issue is the friend's comment. \n\nIs it reasonable to end a friendship over a single joke? That seems harsh. The friend might not have intended anything malicious. The author is making a judgment based on one message and ending a three-year friendship. That could be seen as overreacting. Also, the author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize. The girlfriend might have already addressed it with the friend, but the author is still cutting ties. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that even joking about another person as a partner is disrespectful. If the couple has established boundaries about such terms, then the friend's comment could be a breach. However, the author's approach of cutting off the friend without discussion might be too extreme. Communication between the couple about the author's feelings and then discussing with the friend might be a better approach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are based on jealousy and possibly a lack of communication. Ending a friendship over a single joke without proper context might make the author in the wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because cutting off the friend without understanding the context and overreacting is unreasonable.\n"
