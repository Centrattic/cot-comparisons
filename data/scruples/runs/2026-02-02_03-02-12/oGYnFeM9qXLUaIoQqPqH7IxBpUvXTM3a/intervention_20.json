She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend (gf) who has a long-time female coworker friend. The author, the boyfriend, finds out that the coworker refers to a male coworker as the gf's \"boyfriend\" in a message, which the gf had deleted but the author discovered via her Fitbit. The author then tells the gf to cut off the friendship because the coworker doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset that the coworker used the term \"boyfriend\" when referring to another man. He interprets this as a lack of respect for their relationship. The gf had mentioned that this coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to others much and only interacts with her, so maybe there's a history of some familiarity. The author used the Fitbit data to find out about the deleted messages, which the gf is unaware of.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and communication. The author's main issue is the label \"boyfriend\" being used for someone who isn't him. That might feel like a breach of boundaries, especially if they're in a committed relationship. However, the coworker might not have any ill intent and could be using the term casually, like a joke or a nickname, which is common in workplaces. The gf claims she ignored the message and moved on, so maybe she didn't see it as an issue. \n\nThe author's response is to cut off the friendship entirely. That seems pretty drastic. Ending a friendship over a single joke or misused term could be seen as overreacting, especially if the coworker didn't mean any harm. Also, the author's method of finding out (checking Fitbit messages) might have been a breach of trust, even if the gf deleted messages first. The fact that he used the Fitbit to read messages without her knowledge could be problematic. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing the friendship. The author's justification is that the coworker doesn't respect him as the \"man\" in the relationship. However, it's possible that the coworker didn't intend to disrespect them. The author is taking it upon himself to end the friendship based on one message, which could be seen as controlling or not giving the coworker a chance to clarify. \n\nAdditionally, the author's approach to using the Fitbit data might have been manipulative. He made the gf confess by threatening to use the Fitbit info, which could strain their trust. The author also doesn't consider that the gf might value this friendship and that cutting it off could hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within his rights to feel uncomfortable with someone referring to another man as the boyfriend. In a committed relationship, partners have the right to set boundaries. However, the way he's enforcing it by cutting off the friendship without discussing it with the coworker might be too severe. A better approach could have been to talk to the coworker directly and express the discomfort, rather than ending the friendship abruptly.\n\nIn terms of the gf's actions, she deleted messages but might have done so to avoid conflict or because she thought the joke was harmless. The author's reaction is more about his feelings of insecurity or jealousy than the actual harm caused. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as overreacting. Ending a friendship based on a single, possibly innocent message without giving the coworker a chance to explain is a strong move. Also, using the Fitbit as leverage to get information might have violated their trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for handling the situation so harshly.\n"
