She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author (let's say Person A) is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend (Person B). They live together and have been on and off for four years. His girlfriend has been friends with a co-worker, Sam, for over three years. Initially, the author was okay with Sam waving at her and being the only one he interacts with at work. But now, there's an issue because the co-worker (a female friend, not Sam) referred to Sam as \"boyfriend\" of the girlfriend. The author discovered this through deleted messages on the Fitbit, and now he's cutting off the friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: he found out that the friend called Sam the \"boyfriend,\" which he finds disrespectful. He tells his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with her anymore. The friend's comment was a joke or a work relationship, but the author isn't okay with any such terms. \n\nNow, let's consider the perspectives. The girlfriend's friend made a joke or used a term that the author found offensive. The author believes that the friend shouldn't have used that term and wants the friendship ended. But is that reasonable?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk to his girlfriend about his feelings before cutting off her friend. He used a sneaky method (checking her Fitbit) to find out the messages and then acted without discussing it with her. That's a red flag. Trust and open communication are important. Instead of taking the drastic step of cutting off the friend, maybe he should have discussed his discomfort with the term and how it made him feel. \n\nAlso, the friend's comment might have been innocent. The girlfriend ignored it and moved on. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author. The author is taking it as a personal slight, but the context isn't entirely clear. Maybe the friend was just using a term of endearment in a professional setting, which is sometimes common. However, the author's reaction is to end the friendship, which is a big step. \n\nAnother point is the method of discovery. The author is in a position where he's checking his girlfriend's phone through her Fitbit, which might be an invasion of privacy. Even though she deleted messages, using her Fitbit data without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. This might affect how the situation is viewed. \n\nIs it fair for the author to cut off the friend? Well, it's his choice, but the way he handled it\u2014without open communication and based on a single message\u2014might be hasty. The friend didn't directly address the author about the term. The girlfriend might feel that her friend's comment was trivial and that ending the friendship is an overreaction. \n\nIn relationships, partners need to navigate boundaries and how they handle each other's friendships. The author's approach might be seen as controlling, especially if the term used by the friend was not intended to be disrespectful. The fact that the girlfriend and her friend have been close for a long time adds another layer. Ending the friendship abruptly without discussing it with her could harm the relationship more. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he handled it without proper communication, used a privacy-invading method to find out the information, and made a drastic decision based on a potentially innocent comment. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author, and the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially without first talking to his girlfriend about his feelings.\n"
