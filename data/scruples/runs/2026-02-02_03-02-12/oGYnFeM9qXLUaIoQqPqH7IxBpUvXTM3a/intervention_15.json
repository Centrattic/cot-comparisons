She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else her \"boyfriend\". \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend (GF) has a friend who's been friends for 3+ years. The friend refers to a male coworker as her \"boyfriend\" in a message that the author discovered via a deleted text message shown on the Fitbit. The author then decides the GF shouldn't be friends with her anymore because the friend disrespected him by calling someone else her boyfriend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about jealousy and trust. The author feels that the friend's comment is inappropriate, especially since the GF is in a relationship with him. The GF might not have intended the term to be taken seriously, maybe it was a joke or a work nickname. But the author is taking it as a personal slight, leading to cutting off the friend.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication and mutual understanding. The author's reaction seems pretty extreme. Cutting off a friend over a single joke or misused term could be seen as overreacting. The GF might feel that her friend's comment was innocent, and the author is not respecting her judgment in her friendships. Also, the fact that the author was checking the GF's phone and using the Fitbit data to confront her might have contributed to the situation. Trust issues here are evident. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is being misused, especially since they have a long-term relationship. The GF might have not addressed the friend's comment, which the author sees as her not standing up for him. But the decision to end the friendship entirely seems drastic. The author is making a judgment about the friend's intentions based on one instance, which might not be fair. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationship dynamics vary, but cutting someone off without discussing and understanding the context could be seen as controlling. The author might not be in the wrong if they feel disrespected, but the way they handled it (cutting off the friend without maybe first talking to the GF about their feelings, or the GF addressing the friend directly) might be where the issue lies. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action might be seen as overstepping. They're making a decision about the GF's friendships based on a single incident, which could be perceived as being inconsiderate of her feelings and the nature of her relationship with her friend. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction is extreme and possibly controlling, even if they felt disrespected.\n"
