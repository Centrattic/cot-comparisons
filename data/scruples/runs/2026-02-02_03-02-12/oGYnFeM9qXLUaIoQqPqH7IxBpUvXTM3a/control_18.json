She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, and she's been friends with a coworker (a girl) for over three years. The coworker in question, Sam, is another guy who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that until he found out that the friend (the coworker's name isn't mentioned, let's call her Jane) referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author now wants his girlfriend to stop being friends with Jane because Jane doesn't respect him and the relationship.\n\nSo the main points here: The friend called Sam the boyfriend, the girlfriend didn't respond to that message, and the author used the Fitbit messages to find out about the deleted texts. Then he told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author is making a decision based on a single message where Jane jokingly referred to Sam as the boyfriend. Is that a valid reason to cut off the friendship? The girlfriend has been friends with Jane for three years, and the author is now interfering because of one instance. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. The girlfriend didn't know the Fitbit was keeping messages, so the author leveraged that to get information. That seems a bit manipulative. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, the author used a technical workaround to access them. Maybe that's an invasion of privacy, but the user says not to focus on the phone-checking part. Still, the method raises some red flags about trust issues.\n\nThen, the author is making the decision to cut off the friend without considering if the friend's comment was just a joke. The friend might have been teasing, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author is assuming malice in the friend's action. But \"boyfriend\" in a workplace setting could be a common term for someone you're close to but not actually dating. So maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author is taking control of the situation by cutting off the friend without discussing it thoroughly. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined. Even if the author is uncomfortable, cutting off a friend over one joke is extreme. The friend might not have intended any disrespect, and the girlfriend's reaction (ignoring the message) shows she didn't take it seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels his boundaries have been crossed. He might believe that any reference to another man in a relationship context is inappropriate. But relationships require communication. Instead of cutting off the friend, the author should have talked to his girlfriend about his feelings and maybe discussed boundaries with the friend. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author used underhanded methods to find out about the messages, made a unilateral decision to end the friendship based on a single joke, and didn't consider the context or the friend's intent. This seems controlling and not respecting the girlfriend's long-term friendship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
