She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to outline the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (the girl) for over three years. The author is okay with the girlfriend having a male coworker (Sam) who only interacts with her, but then another coworker (let's call her Jane) refers to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The author finds out through some deleted messages that the friend made this comment, and he's upset because he feels disrespected. So he tells his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore.\n\nNow, considering the context: The girlfriend's friend called another man her \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The author is concerned about his girlfriend's judgment and the friend's respect for their relationship. However, the friend might have been joking or using \"work husband\" terms commonly in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message and moved on, but the author took a hard stance on cutting off the friendship.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel disrespected. If he doesn't want his girlfriend to have a \"work husband,\" then others referring to someone else as her boyfriend could be a problem. But on the other hand, is it the author's place to dictate who his girlfriend can be friends with? The friend was just making a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage. The author took it a step further by cutting off the friend based on a single message. That seems harsh. Relationships require communication, and maybe the author should have discussed his concerns first instead of cutting off the friend entirely. \n\nAlso, the way he found out through deleted messages (even if the Fitbit helped) might indicate trust issues. Maybe the girlfriend didn't tell him about the joke because she thought it was harmless, and the author's reaction was over the top. The key here is whether the friend's action was a genuine disrespect or just a joke. If it's the latter, cutting off the friendship isn't justified. If the author had communicated his feelings first, maybe there's a better way to handle it. So, the author might be in the wrong for taking such a drastic step without discussing it properly.\n"
