She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy whose girlfriend has a close female coworker (let's call them Sam) who referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author took issue with and decided to cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's main issue is that the friend called another man \"boyfriend,\" which he finds disrespectful. He discovered this through messages his girlfriend deleted, which he found out about via her Fitbit. He then ended the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The friend's comment might be a joke or a colloquial term used in the workplace, like a \"work husband,\" which isn't necessarily romantic. The author is taking it as a personal slight, maybe overreacting. The girlfriend tried to downplay it by moving on, but the author is cutting off the friend based on one message. \n\nThe friend might not have intended any harm. The author's approach of ending the friendship abruptly because of a joke could be seen as controlling or overstepping. The girlfriend's friendship with the coworker had been established for years, so ending it over a single instance might not be justified. \n\nAlso, the author's method of discovering the messages through the Fitbit and confronting the girlfriend might have been manipulative. He used her unawareness of the Fitbit not syncing properly, which could be seen as deceitful. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. The author's actions might erode trust if he's using covert methods to monitor his partner. While he has feelings about how others refer to his partner's relationships, his reaction seems extreme. The friend's comment might not have been directed at the author, and cutting off a long-term friendship based on a misunderstanding could be his fault here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's overreaction and method of handling the situation likely make him the asshole. He's taking a joke too seriously and using underhanded tactics to control his partner's friendships. The answer is probably A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I missed. The friend's comment was about someone else, so the author is projecting his own insecurities or jealousy. Yeah, he's in the wrong for cutting off the friend without proper communication and understanding the context.\n"
