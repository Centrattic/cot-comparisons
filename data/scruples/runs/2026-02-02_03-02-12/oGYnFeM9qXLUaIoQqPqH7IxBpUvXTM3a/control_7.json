She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue is that the guy is upset because his girlfriend's friend called another guy \"her boyfriend\" jokingly. He found out by checking her Fitbit, which revealed deleted messages. He then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore because they don't respect him and the relationship.\n\nFirst, the guy is being controlling here. He's cutting off his girlfriend's friend based on a joke. The friend said \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" as a joke, which is common in workplaces. The girlfriend might have ignored it, and the guy isn't satisfied. His reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as the \"man\" and the couple. But is that a valid reason to end a friendship?\n\nAlso, he's using the fact that she deleted messages, which he discovered through her Fitbit. He's been checking her phone before, which is a red flag. Even if he found out through the Fitbit, the fact that he's invading her privacy is problematic. Trust is important in a relationship, and his actions show a lack of trust.\n\nHe's also making a big deal over a joke. Workplace friendships sometimes have playful banter. If the friend meant it as a joke and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously, cutting off the friend seems extreme. The guy's reaction is more about his own insecurity or jealousy rather than a genuine disrespectful act. The friend didn't mean harm, and the joke didn't affect the couple's relationship beyond the guy's perception.\n\nMoreover, the guy is taking sides without considering the context. The girlfriend might have explained that the friend was just joking, but he's already decided to end the friendship. This shows a lack of communication and understanding. Relationships require compromise, and cutting off a friend over a minor issue isn't healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy's actions\u2014checking her phone, invading privacy, and cutting off a friend over a joke\u2014are controlling and overreactive. He's not in the right because his response is disproportionate to the situation, and he's violating trust by monitoring her communications.\n"
