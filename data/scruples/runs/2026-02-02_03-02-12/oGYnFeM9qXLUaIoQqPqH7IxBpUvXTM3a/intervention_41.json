She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's girlfriend has been friends with a coworker named Sam for over three years. The author was okay with the friendship because the girlfriend said Sam doesn't talk to anyone else at work and only waves at her. Then, the author found out that the friend had referred to Sam as \"boyfriend\" in a message, and the girlfriend had deleted those messages. The author confronted her using her Fitbit data and ended up cutting off the friend because he felt disrespected.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend called another guy \"boyfriend,\" the author feels it's inappropriate, and he's cutting off the friendship as a result. The girlfriend had deleted messages, which the author discovered through the Fitbit. The author is not okay with \"work husbands\" or jokes like that and wants the friend to stop being friends with her.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend made a joke that could be considered inappropriate, depending on context. The author is upset that the friend made that reference and doesn't want his girlfriend to be friends with her anymore. But is that a reasonable response?\n\nIn relationships, boundaries vary. Some people are okay with work-related nicknames or jokes, others aren't. The author isn't okay with it and communicated that to his girlfriend. However, cutting off the friend entirely might be a strong reaction. The girlfriend had a long-standing friendship, and the friend's comment might have been a one-time joke. The author is taking away the decision from the girlfriend; she might feel that it's her choice who she's friends with. Also, the fact that the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages could be an issue of trust or privacy, but the user mentioned not to focus on that part.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend. But maybe the friend didn't mean any disrespect, just a joke. The author might be overreacting by cutting off the friendship. The girlfriend might feel that her social life is being controlled, which could strain the relationship. On the other hand, the author has valid feelings about being disrespected, even if it's a joke.\n\nIn many cases, open communication and discussing boundaries would be better than cutting someone off. The author could have talked to the friend about how the nickname was inappropriate instead of ending the friendship. Ending the friendship might be too harsh. Also, the girlfriend's reaction to the friend's comment (ignoring it) suggests she didn't find it okay, but she might have handled it differently.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action of cutting off the friend might be too extreme. It's about whether the friend's action was a big enough issue to lose a three-year friendship. The author might be in the wrong because he's not allowing the girlfriend to handle the situation as she sees fit and is making a unilateral decision based on a potentially minor incident.\n"
