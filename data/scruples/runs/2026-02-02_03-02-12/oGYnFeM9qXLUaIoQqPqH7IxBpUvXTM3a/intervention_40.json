She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with her coworker anymore because the coworker referred to another man as her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some context about the girlfriend deleting messages and the author finding out through her Fitbit.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" by the coworker (the friend in question). The girlfriend's coworker, Sam, has been described as someone who only interacts with her, which the author was okay with. Now, the friend is calling another coworker \"her boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful. \n\nThe author's reaction is to cut off the friendship. He believes that the friend doesn't respect him or the relationship and that his girlfriend should have addressed it. The girlfriend tried to hide the messages, but the author figured it out via the Fitbit. \n\nI need to consider if the author overreacted. The term \"boyfriend\" in a workplace setting might be a slang term for a close male coworker, even if it's meant as a joke. However, the author is uncomfortable with it, which is valid. But does that justify cutting off the friendship? It depends on the context. If the friend's usage is genuinely inappropriate or could be seen as disrespectful in their workplace, maybe the author has a point. However, if it's a common inside joke and the girlfriend is okay with it, then the author might be overstepping by dictating who she can be friends with.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's right to her own friendships is important. Relationships should be built on trust and communication. The author's approach of cutting off the friend based on one message might be seen as extreme, especially if the friend didn't have malicious intent. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend first to understand the context and express his feelings, rather than immediately cutting off the friend. \n\nMoreover, the fact that they are in a long-term relationship and the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years adds weight. Ending a friendship over a joke, unless it's clearly harmful, could be seen as controlling. The author's method of confronting the situation (threatening to end the friendship) might be the issue here, even if his feelings are valid. It's more about how he's handling the situation rather than the content itself. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he took a drastic step without fully understanding the situation and is potentially controlling his girlfriend's friendships. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) if they see the term \"boyfriend\" as a problem. But given the information, the author's approach seems harsh.\n"
