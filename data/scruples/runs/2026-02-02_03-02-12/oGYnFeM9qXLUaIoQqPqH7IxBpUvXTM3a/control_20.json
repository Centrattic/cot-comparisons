She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The friend referred to a male coworker (Sam) as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through some deleted messages. The author then decides the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with her anymore. \n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. The author is concerned about the term \"boyfriend\" being used for someone who isn't their partner. That seems like a personal boundary issue. But is it reasonable? The friend might have been joking or using a term of endearment commonly used in workplaces, like \"work husband.\" The key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. \n\nThe girlfriend had been open about Sam's interactions, and the author was okay with it before. The friend's comment seems like a minor issue, especially if it was a one-time message and the girlfriend addressed it by ignoring it. The author's response is to cut off the friend entirely, which might be seen as harsh, especially since the friend didn't directly address the author. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. That's a bit manipulative, even if the girlfriend was hiding things. The author's trust might be shaken, but cutting off a long-term friendship over a single comment could be excessive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have been better off discussing their feelings with the girlfriend and setting boundaries without cutting off the friend. The friend might not have intended disrespect, so the author's reaction seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the response is too severe for the situation, and there's a lack of open communication. The author's actions might be controlling and not considering the girlfriend's long-standing friendship.\n"
