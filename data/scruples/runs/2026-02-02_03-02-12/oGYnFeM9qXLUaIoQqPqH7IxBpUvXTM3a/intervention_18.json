She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Sam's friend, maybe?) for three years. The author is okay with the friend waving at his girlfriend and the coworker (Sam) being the only one he talks to. But when a message is deleted, the author finds out through the Fitbit that the friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" even though the girlfriend says she ignored the message.\n\nThe author then decides the friend doesn't respect him or the relationship and cuts off the friendship. The key question is whether this reaction is justified.\n\nLooking at the factors: The friend made a joke by calling a coworker her boyfriend, which the girlfriend didn't address. The author feels disrespected because of this joke. However, the friend might have seen it as a harmless work-related joke, common in some workplaces. The girlfriend herself didn't confront the friend, which could imply she found it trivial. The author's decision to end the friendship based on a single joke might be seen as overreacting, especially since the friend has been a long-time friend. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that he doesn't accept such terms in their relationship, and the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" is disrespectful. The girlfriend's lack of action (deleting messages) and the author's discovery through the Fitbit might play into his distrust. However, cutting off a friend entirely over one instance could be seen as harsh. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend's response (ignoring the message) suggests she didn't take it seriously either.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel disrespected and to set boundaries in his relationship. If he communicated that he finds such terms unacceptable, the friend should respect that. However, the method of cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to apologize might be problematic. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's reaction is based on his comfort with the relationship's boundaries, but the severity of the punishment (ending the friendship) versus the offense (a joke) might make him the asshole. Alternatively, if the friend's joke was a clear boundary violation, then it's justified. The ambiguity here is key. Since the friend might not have known it was a problem and the girlfriend didn't address it, the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping. So, the answer might be A, but I'm a bit torn. However, given that the author is acting out of his own discomfort without considering the friend's intent, it's possible he's in the wrong.\n"
