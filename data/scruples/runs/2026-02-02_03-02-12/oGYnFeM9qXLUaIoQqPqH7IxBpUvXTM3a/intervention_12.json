She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years, and the author was initially okay with their interaction. The issue arises when the friend refers to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out through the girlfriend's Fitbit messages that she deleted a message where the friend made this reference. He then decides the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship, leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. It's common for people to feel uncomfortable when their partner has a close friend, especially if there's a co-worker involved. The friend's comment could be seen as crossing a line, using a term that implies a romantic relationship where there isn't one. However, the author's reaction is to cut off the friend entirely, which might be an overreaction unless there's a history of similar issues.\n\nThe girlfriend's role is also important. She didn't tell the author about the friend's comment initially, but when questioned, she explained that she ignored it. The author found out through her Fitbit, which complicates things. The key here is whether the friend's comment was a one-time joke or part of a pattern. If it's a one-time thing, cutting off the friend might be too harsh. Also, the author is making a judgment based on a single instance, which could be seen as not giving the friend a chance to address or clarify the comment.\n\nTrust is another factor. The author initially trusted the girlfriend when she said the co-worker wasn't close. Now, he's not trusting the friendship because of one joke. It's possible that the author is overreacting, especially if the friend didn't mean it maliciously. However, the author has the right to feel that his relationship is being disrespected.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author could have discussed his discomfort with the girlfriend first, rather than cutting off the friend. Ending a friendship based on a single comment without context might be seen as extreme. The girlfriend might feel betrayed if her friend was cut off without being given a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action might be seen as an overreaction. The friend's comment, while potentially inappropriate, doesn't necessarily justify ending the relationship. The author should have addressed the issue with the girlfriend first and maybe with the friend, rather than taking unilateral action. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
