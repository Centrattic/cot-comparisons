She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The friend, Sam, only interacts with her, and the author was okay with that initially. Then, the friend made a joke calling another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and he used a Fitbit to check. He confronted her, and now he's cutting off the friend.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about trust and boundaries. The author is upset because the friend used a term that implies a relationship with someone else. But the friend was joking, and the girlfriend didn't engage with the message. The author is cutting off the friend based on a single joke. Is that reasonable?\n\nJealousy isn't new in relationships, but cutting off a friend over a joke might be overreacting. The friend didn't do anything malicious. The girlfriend didn't act on the joke either. The author's justification is about respect, but maybe the friend didn't intend to disrespect the relationship. The author also used the girlfriend's deleted messages via Fitbit, which might not be the healthiest way to approach the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid feelings about how others refer to partners. However, the solution of cutting off a long-time friend over a single comment seems harsh. The friend might not have realized it was offensive, and the girlfriend didn't take the bait. The author's method of confronting this (using the Fitbit trick) could undermine trust and privacy.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping. They're making a judgment about the friend's intentions without clear evidence of harm. The friend's comment was a joke, not a genuine relationship. The author should address the concern with the girlfriend and maybe the friend, but cutting off the friend entirely over this seems extreme. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
