She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" The key points here are the context of their relationship, the dynamics with the co-worker, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the co-worker (Sam) have been working together for three years. The author was initially okay with their friendship, as the girlfriend mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to many others and just waves at her. So there's some history here. The issue arises when the friend refers to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful.\n\nThe author discovered this through the Fitbit messages, which the girlfriend had deleted on her phone. The friend's message was a joke, and the girlfriend claims she ignored it. The author then tells the girlfriend to cut off the friend because they don't respect him as the boyfriend. The question is whether this is a justified reaction.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. It's common for couples to have different levels of jealousy or possessiveness. The friend's comment was a joke, not a serious claim. The girlfriend didn't engage with it and moved on. The author is upset that the friend used that term, but is it enough to end a three-year friendship? \n\nAlso, the method of discovering the message\u2014using the Fitbit\u2014raises questions about trust. The girlfriend is under the impression the author hacked her phone, which might indicate a lack of trust or a possessive attitude. However, the user's main concern is the action of cutting off the friend.\n\nIs the friend's joke a valid reason to end the friendship? The friend might have been unaware of the girlfriend's relationship status or just being playful. The girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The author is enforcing a boundary that the girlfriend didn't even enforce. The question is whether the author overstepped by making the decision for her to end the friendship.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend and let her decide how to handle the situation. Cutting off a friend based on a single joke might be too harsh, especially if the girlfriend is in the friendship. The author's actions might be seen as controlling, especially if the friend didn't intend harm.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the approach taken\u2014cutting off the friend unilaterally\u2014might be the issue. The answer depends on whether the author's reaction is proportionate and whether he respected the girlfriend's autonomy in handling the situation.\n"
