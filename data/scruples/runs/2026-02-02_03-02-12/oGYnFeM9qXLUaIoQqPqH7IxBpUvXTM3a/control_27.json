She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with their friend, Sam, being around because he doesn't talk to others. But when the friend refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" the author gets upset. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through the Fitbit. The key point is the author ending the friendship because of the friend's joke.\n\nSo, the main question is whether calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a work context is a legitimate reason to cut off a friend. The author thinks it's disrespectful and doesn't want their girlfriend to have such a friend. The girlfriend might not see it as a big deal. \n\nI should consider if the author's reaction is proportionate. The friend used a term that the author found offensive, but is that a valid reason to end the friendship? Maybe the author overreacted. Also, the author didn't confront the friend directly but decided to end the friendship without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nAnother angle: The author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. The girlfriend didn't know the messages were visible there. But the author's main issue is the friend's comment, not the phone privacy. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend didn't address the friend's comment and the author is now cutting the friend off, maybe the author should have talked to the friend first. Cutting off a friend over a joke might be harsh unless there's a pattern of disrespect. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend called another person her \"boyfriend,\" which could be a work joke. The author's reaction seems possessive. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship. \n\nSo, maybe the author is being controlling by ending the friendship without discussion. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the reaction is disproportionate and not addressing the issue directly with the friend first. But some people might say the author is justified in not wanting disrespect. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the friend's comment was a clear boundary issue, the author isn't in the wrong. But the situation seems more like a misunderstanding. The answer could be A because cutting off a friend over a joke isn't right without talking to them. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
