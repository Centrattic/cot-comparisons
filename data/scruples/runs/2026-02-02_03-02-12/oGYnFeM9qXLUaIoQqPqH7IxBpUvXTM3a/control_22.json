She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The key points here are the context of the relationship, trust issues, and the reaction to the friend's comment.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for three months but have a history of being on and off for four years. They live together now. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (Sam) for over three years. The author was okay with the friendship initially, trusting her when she said Sam doesn't talk to others and just waves at her. \n\nThe main incident is when the friend refers to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author discovered this through the girlfriend deleting messages, which he found out via her Fitbit. He confronts her and then decides to cut off the friendship because he feels disrespected. He argues that even if it's a joke or a \"work husband\" thing, he's not okay with it and believes the friend shouldn't have made that comment.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here: The author's jealousy is evident. He's using the friend's comment as a reason to end the friendship, but maybe there's more to it. The girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, moving the conversation on, and the author believes her. However, the way he found out\u2014by checking her phone and Fitbit\u2014might indicate a lack of trust. Even though he claims to trust her, the fact that he used the Fitbit to uncover deleted messages suggests otherwise. \n\nIs cutting off a friend over a single joke or miscommunication a reasonable response? It depends on the context. If the friend regularly makes such comments or if the girlfriend had a history of being disrespectful, maybe. But here, it's a one-time instance. The author's reaction seems extreme. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended to be disrespectful; it could be a joke or a term of endearment they use at work. Also, the author is cutting off the friend because of a comment about another man, which might be more about his own insecurities than the friend's actions. \n\nThe girlfriend's handling of the situation is also a factor. She might have thought the term was harmless and didn't realize it would upset her boyfriend. The author's decision to end the friendship without discussing it with her might be hasty. Communication is key in relationships, and maybe a conversation with the friend to express his feelings would have been better than an immediate cutoff. \n\nAdditionally, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) shows a lack of trust, which could contribute to the girlfriend feeling that the relationship is unstable. The fact that they've been on and off for four years might mean trust is an ongoing issue. The author's reaction here could be a manifestation of deeper trust issues rather than the specific incident itself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014cutting off the friend over a single comment and using invasive methods to uncover the situation\u2014seem excessive and possibly based on his own insecurities rather than the friend's actual wrongdoing. The girlfriend's friend likely didn't intend harm, and the author's response isn't proportionate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not handling the situation with more communication and understanding.\n"
