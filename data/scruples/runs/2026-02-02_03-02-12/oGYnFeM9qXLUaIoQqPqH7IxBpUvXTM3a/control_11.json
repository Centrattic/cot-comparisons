She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a friend from work who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out about this because the friend sent a message referring to the coworker as \"boyfriend,\" and the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author discovered through her Fitbit. Then the author told the girlfriend to end the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him as her partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In some workplaces, people might use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as jokes or to describe a close, non-romantic relationship. But the author is not okay with that, even if it's a joke. The girlfriend might have friends who use such terms without meaning anything by it, but the author sees it as a violation of boundaries.\n\nThe author's main issue is with the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" to refer to another coworker. He feels that this is a disrespect to him as the actual boyfriend. However, the friend might not have known that the author was the boyfriend, and the girlfriend might not have corrected the friend. The author is punishing the friend by cutting ties because of a joke that might be common in their workplace.\n\nAnother point is that the author found out through the girlfriend deleting messages and using the Fitbit to catch her. This could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even though the author used the Fitbit to discover the messages, the main issue here is the friend's comment. The author's reaction is cutting off the friend, which might be an overreaction. Breaking off a three-year friendship over a single joke, even if it's offensive, might be too harsh. The girlfriend might have been the one to correct the friend if she found it offensive, but the author is taking it upon himself to end the friendship without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend might not have been aware that the author would take this so seriously. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the author is making a big deal out of a workplace joke. Relationships require communication, so maybe the author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend first instead of cutting off the friend. The fact that the author uses the friend's joke as a reason to end the friendship could be seen as controlling or possessive, which might be unfair to the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly feels that the term is disrespectful and that the joke is undermining their relationship, he has the right to express that. However, cutting off the friend entirely without giving them a chance to understand his perspective might be too extreme. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the friend might not have known about the relationship when they made the comment. The girlfriend could have addressed the friend's language directly, but the author is taking it upon himself to end the friendship, which might not be the friend's fault.\n\nIn summary, while the author's feelings are valid, his response of cutting off the friend might be an overreaction. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author should communicate his boundaries clearly without taking such a drastic action. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
