She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend who referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and her friend (let's call her Jane) have been friends for three years. The friend has a co-worker named Sam who only interacts with her. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the friend called another co-worker Sam's \"boyfriend,\" leading the author to cut off the friendship.\n\nThe author found out because his girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, he saw the deleted messages. He confronted her, and when he found out about the \"boyfriend\" comment, he told her to stop being friends with Jane because she doesn't respect him or their relationship. The author believes that the friend shouldn't have used that term and that the girlfriend should have addressed it.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key points are: 1) The author found out through sneaky means (checking Fitbit messages despite deleting texts), 2) The friend's comment was a joke or casual reference, possibly a \"work husband,\" which is common in workplaces, 3) The author is cutting off the friend solely based on that one comment, without giving Jane a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has valid feelings about how others refer to his partner's relationships. On the other hand, cutting off a friend over a single joke, especially when the girlfriend didn't take it seriously, might be an overreaction. Also, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit data) could be seen as violating privacy, which adds to the problem.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is reacting to a perceived disrespect, but the response is cutting off the friend entirely. The friend might not have intended harm, and the girlfriend didn't object to the term. The author's approach seems harsh, especially without discussing with Jane first. The fact that the author used underhanded methods to find out the information might also affect the perception of his rightness. So, the author's actions are questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
