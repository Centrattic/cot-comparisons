She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been together on and off for four years. They live together now. She has a friend who's been a co-worker for three years. The friend, let's call her Jane, refers to another co-worker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend\" in a message that the girlfriend deletes. The author finds out through her Fitbit messages that this happened, even though she didn't tell him. He then confronts her and tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as her partner.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about trust, boundaries, and communication. The author's reaction seems to stem from feeling disrespected by Jane's comment. But is cutting off the friendship entirely over one joke a bit extreme? Let's consider the girlfriend's side. She's been friends with Jane for years, and she tried to delete the message, maybe to avoid conflict. The author used the Fitbit data without her knowledge, which might be a privacy issue. Also, the friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" but it's possible that this was a joke or a term of endearment common in their workplace. The author is enforcing a strict boundary that maybe the girlfriend didn't set with Jane. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that even joking about another man being the boyfriend is crossing a line, especially since they have trust issues given their on-again, off-again relationship. The fact that the girlfriend deleted messages makes the author feel insecure, and his reaction is driven by that insecurity. But cutting off a long-term friendship over this seems harsh. The friend might have not intended any harm, and the author is making a judgment based on a single message. \n\nI should also consider if the author has a right to be upset. If the girlfriend had a conversation with Jane about the term \"boyfriend\" and it continued, maybe it's different. But in this case, the girlfriend says she ignored the message, so maybe she didn't address it with Jane. The author is stepping in to enforce a boundary that perhaps the girlfriend didn't. \n\nAnother angle is the method of finding out the message. Using the Fitbit to read messages without her knowledge could be a privacy violation. Even though she deleted the messages, the author's approach might be problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might stem from valid feelings of insecurity and a desire to protect the relationship. However, cutting off the friendship entirely without discussing it with his girlfriend and understanding the context could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend might feel that he's taking control of her friendships without considering her feelings. The friend's comment, while possibly inconsiderate, might not warrant ending the friendship unless there's a pattern of behavior. \n\nTherefore, while the author has valid concerns, his response might be disproportionate. The decision to cut off the friend is up to them, but doing so abruptly without a conversation with the girlfriend might be where he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, the user initially thought the author isn't wrong. Let me check again. The user's own thought is that the author isn't wrong, but the analysis here suggests that the response might be too harsh. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his concerns with his girlfriend rather than unilaterally deciding to cut off the friend. The friend's joke might not have been intended to harm, and the author's reaction could strain the relationship. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong for not handling it more maturely. Therefore, answer A.\n"
