She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend live together and have been together for a while. She has a friend at work who he's been okay with because she told him that the co-worker, Sam, doesn't really talk to anyone else. But then, the girlfriend deleted some messages. The author found out through her Fitbit because the messages took longer to delete there. He confronted her and found out that her friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which he didn't like. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with that friend anymore because it's disrespectful.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is the friend using the term \"boyfriend\" about Sam. The author is upset about this and has decided to end the friendship. Now, is he in the wrong?\n\nWell, relationships involve trust and communication. The girlfriend didn't tell him about the friend's comment, but the author found out through sneaking (using Fitbit data). Even though she deleted messages, he used that to confront her, which might not be the healthiest approach. However, the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" for Sam seems inappropriate. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend, which is a significant action. \n\nIs it right for the author to end the friendship based on one comment? The girlfriend might have a right to her friendships, and maybe the friend was just joking. The author's trust was broken not by the friend's comment but by the girlfriend hiding messages. So maybe the issue is more about the girlfriend's secrecy rather than the friend's words. The author is acting out of jealousy, which can be a red flag. Ending a friendship over a joke might be harsh. Also, the girlfriend might not have done anything wrong beyond not reporting the comment, which was a mistake. The author's method of finding out (snooping via Fitbit) is questionable. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot here. He's acting on jealousy and discovered the comment through sneaky means. While he might feel disrespected, cutting off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend might be overreacting. The girlfriend's friend might not have meant anything by it. The real issue could be the girlfriend's secrecy and the author's snooping. The author's reaction might be based on his own insecurities rather than the friend's actual wrongdoing. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without addressing the communication issues in the relationship first.\n"
