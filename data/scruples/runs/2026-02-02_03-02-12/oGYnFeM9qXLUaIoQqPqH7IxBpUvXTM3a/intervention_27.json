She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is the asshole for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend and the friend (let's call her Jane) have been friends for over three years. The friend has a coworker named Sam who only interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author discovered via her Fitbit. The deleted message was Jane calling Sam the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because she disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is upset because Jane used the term \"boyfriend\" to refer to Sam, implying a relationship that isn't real. The author believes that Jane's use of the term is disrespectful and wants the friendship to end. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend might have already addressed the issue by ignoring the message. The author is taking it a step further by cutting off the friend. The question is, is that justified?\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author found out about the deleted message through sneaky means (using the Fitbit), which might not be the healthiest approach. Also, cutting off a friend over a joke is a big step. Even if the term \"boyfriend\" was used jokingly, it's possible Jane didn't realize it would cause such a reaction. The girlfriend might have considered it harmless, and the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially since he didn't discuss it with her first but instead decided to end the friendship unilaterally.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that the term \"boyfriend\" is disrespectful to their relationship, and he wants to protect his boundaries. There's a valid point about respecting the relationship dynamics. But the method of cutting off the friend without considering the context or Jane's intentions might be harsh. The girlfriend might still value the friendship, and the author's decision could strain their relationship further, especially if she feels he's being too controlling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend's comment was a joke and not a serious issue, the author's reaction might be disproportionate. On the other hand, if he feels the term undermines their relationship, his concern is understandable. The line between protecting the relationship and being overly possessive can be thin here. The fact that he resorted to spying (via Fitbit) doesn't help his case either, as it shows a lack of trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the way he's handling it might make him the asshole. Cutting off a friend over a single joke, especially if it's not malicious, could be seen as an overreaction. The answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach is harsh and based on circumstantial evidence without considering the friend's intent.\n"
