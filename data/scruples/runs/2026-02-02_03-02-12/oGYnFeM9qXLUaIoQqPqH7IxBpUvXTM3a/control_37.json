She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend and the friend have been close for three years. The friend refers to another coworker, Sam, as \"her boyfriend,\" which the author takes issue with. The author discovers this through messages the girlfriend deleted, which he found out via her Fitbit. He then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore because it's disrespectful.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. He doesn't seem to trust the friend's intentions, even though the girlfriend says Sam doesn't talk to many people. The author's reaction is to cut off the friendship entirely. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment could be innocent, like a work husband or a joke. The girlfriend might have already addressed it or thought it was harmless. The author's approach is pretty drastic\u2014cutting off a three-year friendship over one comment. That seems harsh. Also, the author's method of finding out (through Fitbit) might indicate he's been snooping, which could be a red flag in the relationship. But the main issue is whether the author is justified in ending the friendship. Since the friend's comment alone isn't necessarily malicious, the author overreacting by cutting off the friend might be the problem. So, the answer is likely the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
