She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the question) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the main issue here is the friend using the term \"boyfriend\" to refer to Sam, the coworker who only interacts with the girlfriend. The author is upset because they feel this is disrespectful and implies a relationship that isn't there. The girlfriend had a long-standing friendship with this coworker, and the author is now cutting off the friend because of that one comment.\n\nNow, considering the context: the girlfriend had mentioned before that Sam doesn't talk to anyone much and only waves at her. So the author was okay with that situation. Then the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" leading to the author's decision to cut off the friendship. The author also mentions that the girlfriend deleted messages, which they discovered through her Fitbit. But they clarify that the main issue isn't about the deleted messages but about the friend's comment.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. Whether the friend's comment was a joke or meant to be taken seriously.\n2. If the author has a valid reason to feel disrespected or threatened.\n3. The appropriateness of cutting off a friend over a single comment, especially if it was a joke.\n4. The use of surveillance (Fitbit) to monitor deleted messages, but the user says not to focus on that.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the author feels that the friend's comment is inappropriate or disrespects the relationship, it's reasonable to address it. However, cutting off the friend entirely might be an overreaction unless there's a pattern of such behavior. The friend might not have intended any harm, so the author's response could be seen as too harsh.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction is important. If she was okay with the friend's comment and moved on, the author's reaction could be based on their own insecurity rather than the friend's actual actions. The author should have communicated their discomfort with the term first to the girlfriend and maybe to the friend, rather than cutting the friend off immediately.\n\nSo, while the author has a right to feel uncomfortable, the response might be disproportionate. The answer here would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because cutting off a friend over a single joke without addressing it directly could be seen as overstepping, unless there's more context supporting the author's stance.\n"
