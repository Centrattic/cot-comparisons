She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, let's call her Jane, for over three years. The coworker in question, Sam, is someone who doesn't interact much with others but waves at the girlfriend. The author was okay with the friendship initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit that there was a message where Jane referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with Jane because the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are the use of the term \"boyfriend\" by Jane, the author's reaction, and the girlfriend's past behavior (deleting messages). The author believes that Jane's use of the term is crossing a line and that the friend doesn't respect their relationship. The girlfriend tried to move on from the message, and the author is cutting off the friendship because of it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using a term like \"boyfriend\" in a workplace context could be a joke or a term of endearment, even if there's no actual romantic relationship. If Jane and Sam have a close but non-romantic relationship, the term might be casual. However, if the author is uncomfortable with any kind of \"work husband\" or similar terms, that's a personal boundary. But cutting off the friend entirely seems extreme. The author didn't address the issue directly with Jane first, instead cutting off the friendship based on a single incident. The girlfriend might have handled it by talking to Jane, but the author took matters into his own hands without discussing it with her. \n\nAlso, the author's knowledge about the deleted messages comes from the Fitbit, which the girlfriend doesn't know about. This might indicate an invasion of privacy, which is a red flag. Even if the author found out through the Fitbit, using that information to cut off the friend could be seen as unfair. The girlfriend might feel that the author is overreacting, especially if the term was just a joke among coworkers. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the term is inappropriate because he's the actual boyfriend and it undermines the relationship. But the decision to end the friendship is a big step. If the friend didn't realize it was offensive and the girlfriend didn't address it, maybe a conversation with Jane would be better than cutting her off. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's reaction seems overly harsh. He didn't give Jane a chance to explain or correct her behavior. Instead, he cut off the friendship without consulting his girlfriend properly, especially after using privacy-invasive methods to uncover the information. That suggests that he might be in the wrong because he's taking a unilateral decision based on a single incident and possibly misinterpreting the friend's intent. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
