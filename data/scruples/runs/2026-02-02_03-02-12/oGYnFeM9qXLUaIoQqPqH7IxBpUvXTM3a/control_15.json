She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the friend initially because the coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to anyone else at work. Then, the friend refers to another guy as \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The author found out through the girlfriend deleting messages (discovered via her Fitbit) and confronts her. Then he tells her not to be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's main issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else. But there's a lot going on here. The author's approach involved checking her phone and using the Fitbit to find deleted messages. That's a red flag. Trust issues and privacy invasion can harm a relationship. The author's reaction is cutting off a friend based on a single joke. Is that reasonable? Also, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy in friendships is being controlled. The friend's comment might have been a joke, and the author is taking it seriously, but maybe the girlfriend didn't see it as a big issue. However, the author's actions (checking phone, confronting, cutting off) might be overreactions. The key points are: the author's methods of finding out (privacy invasion), the severity of the reaction, and whether the friend's comment was a dealbreaker.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was to delete messages, which could indicate guilt or just being private. The author's trust was broken by her deleting messages, but he used a sneaky method to find out. That's a problem. The friend's comment is a minor issue compared to the author's actions. So, the author might be in the wrong for how he handled it, not just the decision itself. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his methods and overreaction are problematic.\n"
