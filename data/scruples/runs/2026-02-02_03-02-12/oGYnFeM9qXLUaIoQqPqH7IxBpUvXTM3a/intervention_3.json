She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through some deleted messages, which he discovered via the Fitbit, and decided the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the boundaries in a relationship. The author is upset that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else, which he finds disrespectful. He's also concerned about trust because his girlfriend deleted messages, which he found out through the Fitbit. But wait, the main issue is whether cutting off a friend over a joke is justified.\n\nThe friend called another co-worker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which might be a workplace joke. The girlfriend said she ignored it, but the author still takes offense. The problem here is that the friend might not have intended anything serious. The author is reacting strongly by cutting off the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting. Also, the author is using the Fitbit to catch deleted messages, which raises privacy issues. Even though the friend's comment is an issue, the way the author approached it (threatening to end the friendship unless his girlfriend tells the friend to stop) might not be fair. The friend might not even realize it's a problem. The author could have addressed it by talking to the friend directly instead of cutting ties. So, while the friend's comment was inconsiderate, the author's response seems harsh. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without giving them a chance to explain or correct their behavior.\n"
