She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend and this friend have been friends for three years. The friend refers to a male coworker as \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The author discovered this by noticing deleted messages through the Fitbit, which the girlfriend doesn't know about. The author then tells the girlfriend they can't be friends with her anymore because the friend doesn't respect them as a couple.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" for a coworker, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit), and the author's decision to cut off the friendship.\n\nI need to assess whether the author's reaction is justified. On one hand, the friend's comment might be a harmless joke or a term of endearment among coworkers, common in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, so maybe it's not a big issue. The author is being controlling by not allowing the friendship anymore. The method of finding out by checking the Fitbit could be an invasion of privacy, which adds another layer of issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate and could lead to jealousy or misunderstanding. However, cutting off a long-time friend over a single comment seems extreme. The author is acting on a deleted message they found through a sneaky method, which might not be trustworthy. Also, the author is not allowing the girlfriend to decide how to handle her own friendships, which is a matter of personal boundaries.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's actions might be seen as overreacting and controlling. The friend's comment doesn't necessarily indicate disrespect unless there's more to the situation. The author's approach of cutting off the friendship without discussing it with the girlfriend might be the problem here. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
