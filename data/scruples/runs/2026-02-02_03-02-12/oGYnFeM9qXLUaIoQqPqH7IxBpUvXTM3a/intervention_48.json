She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The friend, Sam, only interacts with the girlfriend and others at work, but the girlfriend said he doesn't talk to anyone else. The author was initially okay with this because he trusted her.\n\nThen there's the issue of checking phones. Both of them go through each other's phones. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit that she had, which she didn't know. The deleted message had the friend referring to Sam as \"boyfriend,\" but the girlfriend claims she ignored it. \n\nThe author then told the girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as her partner. The author is against work relationships, even playful ones, and thinks the friend was out of line.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend's friend made a comment that the author found disrespectful. But is cutting off a three-year friend over a one-time message a reasonable reaction? The author's trust might be shaken, especially since there was prior phone checking and message deletion. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being challenged, as she had a long-standing friendship. \n\nThe key points are: the author's actions stem from jealousy or insecurity, using the deleted message as a justification. However, cutting off a friend based on a single joke, especially after checking phones and having prior trust issues, could come off as controlling. The author's approach might be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend's comment was innocent. The girlfriend's response (ignoring the message) suggests she didn't take it seriously, so the author's drastic action might not be justified. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend, discussing boundaries with the friend or addressing the issue with the girlfriend might have been better. The author's decision to end the friendship without knowing the full context of the situation could be seen as not allowing the girlfriend to handle her own social interactions, which her friend might not mean harm. \n\nSo, while the author has valid feelings about respect in the relationship, his method of handling it might be seen as excessive. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's imposing his control over a friendship without sufficient cause and using privacy invasion as a basis for his decision.\n"
