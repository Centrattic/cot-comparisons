She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The guy (Sam) has been a co-worker for a while but isn't close with others. The friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend\" in a message, which the girlfriend deleted. The author found out through the Fitbit messages and then decided to cut off the friend because they felt disrespected.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons for cutting off the friend. The author is upset that the friend made a joke using the term \"boyfriend\" which the author finds offensive. They believe the friend doesn't respect them as the boyfriend. But the friend's comment was likely a joke and not a serious claim. The girlfriend didn't take the comment seriously and moved on, so maybe the friend didn't mean any harm.\n\nThe author's reaction seems a bit extreme. Cutting off a long-term friend over a casual joke might be too harsh. Also, the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages as a reason, but the main issue is the friend's comment. The girlfriend might feel that her friend is being playful, not disrespectful. The author's trust in the girlfriend is important, but the way he's handling the situation could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's actions (deleting messages) might have led to the discovery, but the root issue is the friend's joke. The author is making a judgment about the friend based on a single comment, which might not be fair. So, the author could be in the wrong for overreacting and cutting off the friend without considering the context or the friend's intent.\n"
