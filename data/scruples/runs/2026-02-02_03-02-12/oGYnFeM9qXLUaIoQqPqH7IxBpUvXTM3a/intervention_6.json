She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The friend, Sam, is a co-worker who only interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that. But then the friend refers to another coworker as \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes as a joke or a disrespectful term.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. The author found out the friend called someone else \"boyfriend\" through the girlfriend's deleted messages, which he discovered via the Fitbit. The author then decides to end the friendship, saying the friend doesn't respect him or the couple.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend's comment might have been a joke, and in some workplaces, people use terms like \"boyfriend\" or \"work husband\" casually. The author's reaction is to end the friendship over this. But did the girlfriend know about the term? She says she ignored the message and moved on. The author didn't confront the friend first but went straight to cutting her off. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the term is inappropriate, especially since it's a term of endearment that could imply a romantic relationship. The girlfriend didn't address it, so the author took it upon himself to end the friendship. However, cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke might be an overreaction. The context matters here: if the friend regularly uses such terms, it's different. But in this case, it's a one-time message, and the friend might not have realized it was offensive. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) might indicate a lack of trust, which could be a problem. But the main issue is the response. Ending a friendship over a joke might be too harsh. The author could have talked to the friend first to understand the context and explain why it was offensive instead of cutting her off immediately. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize, and for not discussing it with his girlfriend to see if she wanted to address it. The reaction seems excessive given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
