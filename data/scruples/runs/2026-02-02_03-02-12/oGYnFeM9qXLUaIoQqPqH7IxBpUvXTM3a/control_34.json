  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about his girlfriend's friend calling another coworker her \"boyfriend\" and the author cutting off the friendship. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people at work but waves at her. The author was okay with this initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author discovered through her Fitbit. One of the deleted messages was about Sam being called her \"boyfriend.\" The author now wants her to stop being friends with the coworker because the friend made that comment.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is cutting off a long-term friendship over a joke, the girlfriend didn't know the friend said that, and he used sneaky methods (checking Fitbit) to find out. The friend's comment might have been a joke or a slip, but was it that big of a deal? The author is enforcing a strict rule against any \"work husband\" jokes, which some might see as controlling. Also, the girlfriend didn't intentionally hide the friend's comment; she just deleted messages, maybe to keep things private. The author's reaction seems harsh, especially since the friend might not have realized it was offensive. The fact that he's using the Fitbit to monitor her also raises red flags about trust issues. \n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014cutting off a friend over a single joke, using surveillance to monitor his partner, and not giving the friend a chance to explain\u2014might make him the asshole. He's prioritizing his own insecurity over his girlfriend's long-term friendship without clear justification. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
