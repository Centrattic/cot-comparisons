She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a guy whose girlfriend (28) has a friend (let's call her the friend) who has been working with her for over three years. The friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend,\" which upsets the author. He found out because his girlfriend deleted messages, and using her Fitbit data, he discovered the message where the friend referred to Sam (a coworker) as \"her boyfriend.\" The author then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend have been on and off for four years but are currently living together. They go through each other's phones, which might be a red flag in itself. The friend in question has a coworker, Sam, who doesn't talk to many people, but he does interact with the girlfriend. The friend jokingly calls Sam \"her boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend ignored. The author is upset about this and is cutting off the friendship because of it.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend made a joke calling another man the girlfriend's boyfriend, the author found out through the girlfriend's deleted messages (and Fitbit data), and he's ending the friendship because of it. The author's main argument is that the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship by making that joke.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. \n\n1. **Friendship Boundaries:** The friend has been friends with the girlfriend for three years. The joke about Sam being her boyfriend is likely a light-hearted comment, not a serious one. The author is taking this as a serious disrespect, but maybe it's just a joke among coworkers. The girlfriend even says she ignored the message, suggesting she didn't take it seriously.\n\n2. **Communication Issues:** The author and his girlfriend go through each other's phones, which is a significant issue. Trust issues here might be contributing to his reaction. The fact that he used her Fitbit to find out about the messages shows a lack of trust and maybe an over-the-top method to invade her privacy. That's problematic on its own.\n\n3. **Overreaction to a Joke:** The friend calling someone else \"boyfriend\" is a common workplace joke. It's not clear if there's any actual relationship between Sam and the friend or if it's just a nickname. The author is cutting off a long-time friendship over a joke, which might be excessive. The girlfriend didn't take it seriously and didn't confront the friend about it, so the author's reaction might be unnecessary.\n\n4. **Respect for Friendships:** The author is dictating who his girlfriend can and cannot be friends with based on a single joke. That could be controlling. Healthy relationships involve respecting each other's friends unless there's a valid reason (like harassment or betrayal). A joke doesn't seem like a valid reason here.\n\n5. **Privacy Invasion:** The author's method of finding out about the messages by checking her Fitbit and then using that to pressure her into revealing deleted messages is a privacy violation. Even if the friend's joke was offensive, the way he found out isn't healthy.\n\nPutting this together, the author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, using privacy-invading tactics, and overreacting to a minor issue. The friend's comment is probably not a serious issue, and cutting off a long-time friend over it is a harsh response. The author's actions (phone checking, using Fitbit data) are problematic and suggest a lack of trust and communication issues in the relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
