She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend is upset that his girlfriend's friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend,\" leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years, and the boyfriend was initially okay with their relationship. However, when he discovers messages where the friend refers to another coworker as \"her boyfriend,\" he decides to end the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nThe main issue here is whether cutting off a friend based on a casual joke is justified. The friend's comment might have been a light-hearted joke or a term of endearment common in workplaces. The boyfriend seems to take it as a serious disrespect, but the girlfriend didn't find it problematic and even moved on from the conversation. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend used the girlfriend's deleted messages (revealed through her Fitbit) to confront her. This might indicate a lack of trust, and using a third-party device to monitor her could be seen as invasive. However, the girlfriend did delete messages, which might suggest she was hiding something, but the friend's comment might not have been the main issue.\n\nThe key is whether the boyfriend's reaction is proportionate. Cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke might be an overreaction. The friend didn't address the boyfriend directly, and the girlfriend didn't engage with the comment. The boyfriend's decision to end the friendship based on a third party's remark without discussing it with his girlfriend first could be seen as controlling or insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend has boundaries about how others refer to his partner's relationships, he has the right to express that. However, cutting off the friend entirely without giving them a chance to clarify or apologize might be harsh. The boyfriend's approach seems abrupt and possibly based on jealousy rather than a genuine disrespect from the friend.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of ending the friendship, discussing his concerns with his girlfriend and the friend might have been a better approach. His method of finding out through monitoring also raises questions about trust issues within the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's actions might be seen as the wrong. He overreacted to a minor issue and used underhanded methods to uncover the messages. However, there's a nuance here. If the friend's comment was a recurring issue or part of a pattern, it might be different. But based on the given scenario, it seems like a one-time joke that the girlfriend didn't engage with. Therefore, the boyfriend's decision to cut off the friend is likely an overreaction, making him the asshole here.\n"
