She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because that friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The couple has been on and off for four years and now live together. The girlfriend has a female coworker (let's say Jane) she's been friends with for three years. The guy (author) was okay with her friend because she said the coworker Sam doesn't talk to anyone else and just waves. But now, the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" and the author is upset. He found out through the girlfriend's Fitbit messages (she deletes her texts but the Fitbit lags). He confronted her, and now he's cutting off the friend because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. So, I need to consider a few things. First, the reason for cutting off the friend. The friend made a joke by calling Sam the \"boyfriend.\" The author is not okay with any \"work husband\" jokes. The girlfriend tried to tell him that she was okay with the friend, but the author is still cutting her off.\n\nIs it reasonable for the author to be upset? Maybe he feels disrespected because someone else is using a term that's supposed to be exclusive to their relationship. On the other hand, the friend might have been joking, and maybe the girlfriend had already clarified that Sam isn't her boyfriend. The issue is whether cutting off a three-year friend over a single joke is too harsh. Also, the author is using the fact that the girlfriend deleted messages, which he found out through her Fitbit, which might be a bit of an invasion of privacy. But he says he didn't hack her phone, she just didn't know her Fitbit was a clue.\n\nAnother point: The author is assuming that the friend \"doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple,\" but the friend might have been just making a light-hearted joke. The girlfriend might have addressed it with her friend, but maybe the author is overreacting. Also, the author is making a big decision (cutting off the friend) based on one instance. That could be seen as extreme.\n\nAdditionally, the author's method of finding out the messages through the Fitbit and pressuring the girlfriend to tell him what she deleted might be problematic. It shows a lack of trust, even though the girlfriend was already deleting messages. However, the user says not to focus on the phone checking part.\n\nSo, on one hand, the author is standing up for his relationship and his feelings. On the other hand, cutting off a friend over a joke might be too much, and there's a lack of communication with the friend to resolve it. The girlfriend might have had the chance to address the issue with her friend, but the author is taking matters into his own hands. \n\nIn AITA situations, the key is whether the action was reasonable. If the friend's comment was a one-time joke and the girlfriend had already moved past it, then the author might be overstepping. However, if the author feels that such terms are non-negotiable in their relationship, then maybe it's justified. But cutting off a friend for a single joke seems harsh. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's being overly controlling, but some might argue he's justified in his boundaries. However, the way he's handling it (cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize) could be the issue.\n"
