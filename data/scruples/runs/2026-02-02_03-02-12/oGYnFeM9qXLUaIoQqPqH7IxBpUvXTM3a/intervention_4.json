She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend had a friend who had been friends for over three years, and the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through deleted messages and the Fitbit. He then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction is justified. The friend's comment was likely a joke or a term of endearment among coworkers, which might not be malicious. The author seems to take it as a personal slight and cuts off the friend abruptly. But is that reasonable?\n\nThe girlfriend had already mentioned that the coworker (Sam) only interacts with her, which the author was okay with before. Now, the friend's comment led to conflict. The author is concerned about boundaries, but maybe he should have discussed the issue with the friend first instead of cutting off the friendship. Also, the author's method of finding out (using deleted Fitbit messages) might be a point of contention. However, the user mentioned not to focus on the phone-checking part, so maybe that's a red herring here.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's action was a joke, and the author is overreacting. Relationships require communication, and maybe the author should have talked to the friend to address the comment rather than ending the friendship. The girlfriend might also need to communicate her boundaries to her friend directly.\n\nBut the author feels disrespected and wants to protect his relationship. Is that a valid reason? It's a gray area. Cutting off a friend over a joke might be harsh, but if the comment made the author uncomfortable and the friend didn't respect the relationship, maybe the author has a point.\n\nWait, the key here is whether the friend's comment was intended to be a joke or if it was a genuine term. The friend called the co-worker her \"boyfriend,\" which could be a joke about their work relationship. The author is taking it as a serious issue, but perhaps it's not the friend's intention to disrespect the author. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend entirely without addressing the friend directly.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for cutting off the friend without discussing it with them? Yes, because he's taking a drastic step without understanding the context or giving the friend a chance to explain or clarify. The friend might not have realized the comment was an issue. The author should have first talked to his girlfriend about his feelings and maybe addressed the friend directly, rather than cutting off the friendship abruptly. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's overreacting and not handling the situation with nuance.\n"
