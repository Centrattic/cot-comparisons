She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to continue being friends with a coworker who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, only interacts with her girlfriend, but they're just coworkers. The author was okay with that because they trusted her. Now, the coworker called another guy her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out about through some deleted messages that the girlfriend had. The author then decided to end the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nHmm. The author's main issue is the coworker calling someone else \"boyfriend.\" But the coworker is a woman, right? The friend called the other guy her \"boyfriend.\" Wait, the friend is a woman, and she called another guy her \"boyfriend.\" So that's just a work colleague, maybe a joke between coworkers. The author is upset because the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else, even if it's just a joke. \n\nBut the girlfriend didn't respond to that message. She just moved on. The author found out through deleted messages and then decided to cut off the friendship. The key points here are: the author is reacting to a joke that might be innocent, using a deleted message as a reason, and cutting off the friend without the friend knowing why. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the friend didn't say anything to the author, just joked with the girlfriend about a coworker. The girlfriend didn't engage, so maybe the friend didn't realize it was a problem. The author is taking offense as the boyfriend, but is it justified? \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is exclusive to their relationship, and the friend's use of it for someone else is disrespectful. But usually, people use terms like \"work boyfriend\" as a joke, not as a real relationship. However, the author's reaction seems harsh because the friend didn't address the author directly or disrespect the relationship. \n\nAlso, the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to read deleted messages, which is a bit of a privacy issue. Even if she deleted the messages, the author's method of finding out could be problematic. The girlfriend didn't know he found out, so he's punishing her friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nSo, the author is cutting off a long-time friend over a joke that might not have been intended to be offensive. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend, and the author is making a big decision based on a single message. It seems like the author is being controlling and not trusting his girlfriend, even though she didn't engage with the message. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have talked to the friend first, maybe, to address the joke, but instead he's cutting off the friendship. That seems extreme. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he's overreacting and violating privacy.\n"
