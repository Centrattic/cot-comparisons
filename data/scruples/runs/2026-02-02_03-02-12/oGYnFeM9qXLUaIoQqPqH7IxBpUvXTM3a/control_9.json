She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after she called another co-worker her \"boyfriend\" (Sam). The girlfriend and her friend have known each other for three years, and the author is upset that the friend made that joke. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The girlfriend's friend, let's call her Jane, made a joke by referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, but through her Fitbit, he discovered the conversation. The friend might have been joking, but the author is upset because he sees it as a lack of respect towards their relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend had told the author that Sam is just someone who waves at work and doesn't interact much with others. The author initially trusted her. However, the friend's comment about Sam being her \"boyfriend\" is the trigger. The author then cuts off the friend, saying she doesn't respect him as the boyfriend. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, jealousy and trust are big factors. The author is feeling disrespected by the friend's joke. However, the friend might not have intended anything serious. If the friend is known to joke around with the girlfriend and others, maybe it's just a casual thing. The girlfriend even said she ignored the message and moved on, implying she didn't take it seriously. \n\nBut the author is cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke. That seems extreme. The friend might not have realized the joke could be offensive. Also, the girlfriend had the chance to address it with her friend but didn't, and now the author is taking it further. \n\nThe author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit to check messages) is deceitful, even though the girlfriend lied about deleting them. The fact that he's using this as a reason to cut off the friend might be based on a misunderstanding. If the friend had no ill intent, then cutting her off is harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel disrespected and might want to protect his relationship. But cutting off a friend over a joke could be seen as overreacting unless there's a pattern of behavior. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. The friend's comment could be a one-time joke, and the author is taking it too seriously. The girlfriend should have communicated her boundaries to her friend, but the author's response is extreme. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
