I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe woman is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. She mentions that her family isn't on speaking terms except for rare texts that turn into arguments. She ran away from home two years ago because her family was controlling and mentally abusive. Her mom is a narcissist, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, etc. Now she's independent, in a stable relationship, and pregnant. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell her family, but she feels conflicted. She's scared of their reaction, worried they'll call her a liar, criticize her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child. She's also worried the child might hate her later for not knowing the other side of the family. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, I should consider the circumstances. The author has a history of abuse and control from her family. She left them for her own safety and well-being. Not telling them about the pregnancy could be a protective measure, especially if she believes they would react negatively. But there's also a sense of guilt she's feeling because she hasn't spoken to them in a while. The question is whether she's at fault for not sharing the news.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family members unless there are specific legal ties, but this is more about moral responsibility. The key points here are the safety and well-being of the author and her child. If the family is toxic, withholding the information might be a reasonable choice to protect herself and her child from potential harm. However, some might argue that keeping the child from extended family (even if estranged) could have consequences, but the author is concerned about the child being treated the same way she was.\n\nI should also consider the nature of the relationship. The author hasn't initiated contact; the family only reaches out to harass her. In such cases, the responsibility to keep them informed might be minimal. If the family isn't part of her life, maybe she's not obligated to share updates. However, some people might think that even in estrangement, a parent has a right to know about a grandchild. But if the author believes the family would use that as a point of control or criticism, it's understandable to avoid it.\n\nAnother angle is the child's future. The author is worried the child might resent her for not having contact with the other family. But if the family is toxic, the author might be protecting the child from negative influences. It's a tough balance. Ultimately, the decision hinges on the safety and well-being of both the author and the child. Given the history of abuse and control, the author's choice to not inform them seems like a self-protective measure rather than being in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
