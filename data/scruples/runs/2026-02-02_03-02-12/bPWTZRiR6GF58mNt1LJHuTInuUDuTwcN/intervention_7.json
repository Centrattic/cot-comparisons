We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is pretty intense. She left her family two years ago because they were controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like environment. She's now safe, in a happy relationship, and pregnant. She hasn't told her family because she's scared of their reaction and doesn't want her child to go through the same abuse she did.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's decision not to tell her family isn't just about hiding something; it's about protecting herself and her unborn child from a toxic environment. The family hasn't been supportive; they've been abusive and invasive. The author's fear is legitimate based on her past experiences. \n\nThe main question is whether withholding information from family you're not in contact with is wrong. But if the family isn't part of her life, and she's protecting her child from potential abuse, it's more about safety than secrecy. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her personal safety and her child's well-being are the top priorities here.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's narcissistic behavior, confronting them about the pregnancy could lead to more conflict and emotional harm. The author is prioritizing her mental health and her baby's future. So, in this scenario, it's not about being in the wrong but about making a protective choice based on past trauma. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
