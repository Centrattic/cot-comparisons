We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a history of a very controlling and abusive family. She ran away at 20 because of the mental abuse and the family's controlling behavior. Now, she's pregnant and hasn't told them, fearing their reaction. She's worried they might react badly, criticize her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamics. The family is described as controlling, abusive, with a narcissistic parent and a cult-like environment. The author left to escape that, so maintaining contact is already strained. The key point here is whether she has a responsibility to inform them. Legally, parents aren't required to inform estranged family members about a pregnancy unless there are custody issues or other legal ties. Since she's estranged and the family hasn't been supportive or nurturing, her decision to keep it private is more about her well-being and the child's safety.\n\nEmotionally, she's conflicted but the reasons for not telling them are valid. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations that families should be informed, but in this case, the family's behavior complicates that. The author's priority is her own safety and her child's, which is understandable. \n\nThe aspect of the child meeting the family is a concern, but if the family is abusive, it's in the child's best interest to avoid that. The fear of the child being treated the same way is a legitimate reason to keep it secret. The question is whether her choice is morally wrong. Given the context, it's not wrong to prioritize her well-being and her baby's. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong."
