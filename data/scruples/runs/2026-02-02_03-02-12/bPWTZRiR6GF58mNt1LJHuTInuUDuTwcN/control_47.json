We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They aren't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The family is described as controlling and abusive. The author left home at 20 due to mental abuse and now has a stable life with a boyfriend. She's considering whether to tell her family, fearing their reaction and potential harm to her child. The main question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping this secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is abusive and controlling, with a history of mental abuse. The author left because of this, which suggests she had valid reasons to cut ties. The family hasn't reached out in a supportive way; their texts are more harassment. If she told them, they might react negatively, possibly harming the child or causing her stress. \n\nThe ethical aspect here involves the author's well-being and her child's safety. Since the family is portrayed as toxic, it's reasonable for her to protect herself and her unborn child from potential negativity. The question is whether not informing them makes her wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to choose their family and protect themselves from harmful relationships. The fact that the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship or reached out in a supportive manner plays a significant role. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a healthy, communicative family but from an abusive one. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell, which shows that her decision is based on her own judgment and concerns. The fear of the family's reaction and the potential impact on the child's life are valid concerns. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision to not inform her family isn't out of selfishness but out of a need to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment. Therefore, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
