We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her family, especially her mom, who's described as narcissistic and controlling. The family is very religious and controlling. The author ran away two years ago because of the abuse.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and control. The family hasn't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. The author is scared of how they'll react if she tells them about the pregnancy. She's worried they'll blame her for being unmarried, and she's also concerned about her child being exposed to that toxic environment.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping it a secret. From what I read, the author is in a position where she's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family isn't supportive; they've been harmful in the past. Choosing not to reveal the pregnancy seems like a self-protective measure rather than a malicious act. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The author isn't withholding information out of spite but because she knows the family's reaction would be negative and harmful. So the answer should be B.\n"
