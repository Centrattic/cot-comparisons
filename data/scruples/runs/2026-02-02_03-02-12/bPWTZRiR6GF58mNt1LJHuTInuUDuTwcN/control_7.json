We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that the writer ran away from home two years ago due to a controlling and abusive family. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is religious and controlling. They haven't spoken except for some occasional texts that turn into arguments. She's now pregnant and considering whether to tell her family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the history of abuse and control. She left because of that, so she has valid reasons to be cautious. The family hasn't been supportive; instead, they've been harassing her. She's worried about their reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and how they might treat her child. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, family relationships are important, but so is personal safety and well-being. If the family is abusive, withholding information might be a protective measure. The question is about \"wrongness.\" If she's protecting herself and her child from harm, then she's not in the wrong. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations about family, but her actions are prioritizing her well-being and her child's. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because her decisions are based on protecting herself from an abusive environment. There's no obligation to expose oneself or one's child to harmful situations. The fact that she hasn't initiated contact and only responds to their rare texts shows she's not cutting off communication out of spite but due to necessity. The fear of negative reactions and potential harm to her child supports her choice.\n"
