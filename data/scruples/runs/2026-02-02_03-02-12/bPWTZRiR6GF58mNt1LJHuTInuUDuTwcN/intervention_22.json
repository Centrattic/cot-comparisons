We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author in the given situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about the pregnancy. Let me start by understanding the details.\n\nThe author is about 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They only communicate occasionally, and when they do, it's through texts that turn into arguments. The author ran away from home two years ago at 20 because of a controlling and abusive family environment. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and pushing their religious values. Now she's stable, in a happy relationship, and pregnant, but is struggling with whether to tell her family.\n\nShe mentions feeling guilty for hiding it, but questions if it's really hiding if they haven't talked in months. She's scared of their reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and how they might treat her child. She's also worried the child might resent her later for not knowing the family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she's conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points are the history of abuse, lack of communication, and fear of negative consequences. The author's decision is based on protecting herself and her child from potential harm. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether there's an obligation to inform family. In many cases, people have the right to make decisions about their own lives, especially when there's a history of abuse. The author has a valid reason to avoid contact with her family to protect her mental health and her child's well-being. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being over a family that has been harmful. There's no legal or moral obligation to inform estranged, abusive family members, especially if it could lead to further harm.\n"
