We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author left home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive family. Her mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They have no real communication except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She's now pregnant, and the boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell the family. She feels guilty but is scared of their reaction.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the lack of a positive relationship. The author's decision not to tell her family stem from a place of self-preservation and protecting her child. The family's past behavior suggests they might react negatively, possibly blaming her for being unmarried and pregnant, which could harm her child. The author is also worried about her child being exposed to the same toxic environment she experienced.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether withholding information in this context is morally wrong. Since the family isn't part of her regular life and their interactions are harmful, it's reasonable for her to protect herself and her child. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a malicious intent but to avoid harm. There's no obligation to share personal news with people who have been abusive and aren't supportive. The guilt she feels might be due to societal expectations, but her well-being and her child's safety are paramount. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
