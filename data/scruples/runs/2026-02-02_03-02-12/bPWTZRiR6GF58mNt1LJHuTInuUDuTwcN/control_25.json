We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They haven't been on speaking terms for a while, and the family is described as controlling, abusive, and religious. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The family was abusive, controlling, and the mother is a narcissist. The user ran away because of this. The family doesn't reach out unless it's to scream at her. So the existing relationship is already strained and toxic. The user is scared of how they'll react, especially about being unmarried and pregnant. Also, she's worried about her baby being exposed to that environment.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. From what I read, the family isn't in her life in any healthy way. They don't have a relationship, so keeping the pregnancy secret might not be wrong. She's protecting her child from a harmful environment. Also, she's not hiding it from someone who's actively part of her life. The fact that they haven't spoken for months and only contact her to harass her suggests that she's not obligated to share personal information with them. She's making a choice to prioritize her well-being and her child's well-being over a toxic family connection. So I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
