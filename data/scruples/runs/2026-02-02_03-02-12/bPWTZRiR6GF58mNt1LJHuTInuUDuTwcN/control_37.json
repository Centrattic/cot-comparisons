We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The user provided a detailed scenario where she's been estranged from her family for a while. They mention her family being controlling and abusive, which led her to run away when she was 20. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told her family, and she's struggling with whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't on speaking terms except for rare, hostile texts. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather as part of a controlling, religious environment. The author left because of the abuse. That's a significant red flag. In cases of abuse, maintaining distance is often necessary for the victim's well-being. \n\nThe question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing. If the family isn't part of her life and they haven't reached out except to scream at her, then not sharing big life events like a pregnancy might not be in the wrong. Especially if sharing could put her and her child at risk. The author is protecting herself and her child from potential harm, which is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, some might argue that not telling parents about a grandchild could be seen as a family issue. But given the history of abuse and control, the author's choice to not engage is more about self-preservation. The guilt she feels is understandable, but it's important to consider the family's role in the estrangement. They were the ones who were abusive and controlling, so the responsibility isn't on her for cutting ties. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows he respects her decision. The author's fear of the family's reaction and the potential impact on the child is valid. She's considering the child's well-being, which is a key factor. \n\nIn ethical terms, the \"wrong\" would depend on the intent. If she's hiding it to protect herself and the child from abusers, that's not the wrong. The family's behavior is the root of the problem here. So the answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong. \n\nI should also think about cultural norms, but given the extreme abuse, those norms might not apply. The priority is safety and mental health. So the answer is B.\n"
