We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The family only communicates occasionally through texts, which are usually confrontations. The author ran away from home two years ago because their family was controlling and abusive. The mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult with extreme religious views. They controlled the author's life, invading their privacy and controlling their finances. The author is now in a stable situation with a partner and is pregnant.\n\nThe author is conflicted because the boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, but they feel guilty. The family might react negatively, especially since the author is unmarried. The author is also worried about their baby not meeting the family and how they might treat the child. The main question is whether the author is at fault for not telling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family's behavior. The family is described as abusive and controlling. The author left due to the abuse, so maintaining contact is already difficult. The family's past actions suggest that they are not supportive and could be harmful. The author's decision not to share such a personal news might be a protective measure for themselves and the child.\n\nThe concept of \"hiding\" the pregnancy is discussed. The author hasn't had contact with the family in months, so not telling them isn't a lie if they weren't in regular communication. The fear is valid given the history. The author's priority is to protect their child from potential harm, which is a common concern for parents.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family members about a pregnancy unless there's a specific legal context, which isn't mentioned here. Emotionally, the author is prioritizing their well-being and their child's future over family ties that are toxic. The guilt the author feels might be from societal expectations, but the situation is more complex due to the family's behavior.\n\nIn many cases, when there's a history of abuse or neglect, cutting off contact is a healthy choice. The author isn't at fault for protecting themselves and their child from a harmful environment. The family's potential reaction could be harmful, and the author is avoiding that conflict. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is acting in self-preservation and the child's best interest, given the family's history.\n"
