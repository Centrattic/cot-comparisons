We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, the author describes a history of a very controlling and abusive family environment. They ran away at 20 due to mental abuse, and there's a lot of religious control and invasion of privacy. The family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. Now she's pregnant, 37 weeks along, and hasn't told them. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. The family is described as extremely controlling and abusive. If she told them, they might react negatively, possibly causing harm to her or the unborn child. The author is worried about their reaction, the potential for them to criticize her for being unmarried, and the impact on her baby. Also, the family hasn't been in contact, so the idea of \"hiding\" might not apply if they rarely communicate. \n\nFrom a psychological and emotional standpoint, it's important to prioritize her well-being and the baby's safety. If the family isn't supportive and has a history of abuse, keeping the pregnancy private seems reasonable. The author is also concerned about her child being affected by the family's behavior, which is a valid fear. \n\nLegally, the family has no right to that information unless there's a court order or specific obligation, which isn't mentioned here. Ethically, the decision is personal. The author is prioritizing her safety and her child's safety, which is a valid choice. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She's acting in her best interest and her child's given the toxic family dynamic.\n"
