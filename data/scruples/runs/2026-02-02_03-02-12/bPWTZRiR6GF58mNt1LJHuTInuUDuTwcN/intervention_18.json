We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with their family, which is described as controlling and abusive. They ran away at 20 due to mental abuse and now have a child with their partner. The family hasn't been in touch except for rare texts that turn into screaming. The author is scared of how the family would react\u2014likely negative\u2014given their history of controlling behavior and pushing religious values. They're also worried about their daughter possibly facing the same treatment.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, consider the context: the family is abusive and controlling. The author left the family for safety. Withholding a pregnancy might be seen as avoiding further harm. Since the family doesn't have a healthy relationship, the author's decision could be protective. The author is also considering the child's future, wanting to shield them from abuse. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But in this case, the family hasn't maintained contact and has a history of abuse. The author's priority is their safety and their child's, which is understandable. \n\nThe key factors are the history of abuse, lack of communication, and the potential harm from informing the family. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a current relationship but from a toxic one. The guilt comes from the natural desire to share a major life event, but the circumstances make it a protective choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong. Their decision is based on protecting themselves and their child from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
