We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. They have a complicated family situation\u2014abusive parents, ran away, and have been estranged. The question is whether not telling their mom makes them the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the key points here: the family is described as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like environment. The person left because of the abuse. The mom hasn't reached out except for rare texts that turn into yelling. The author hasn't spoken to them except when they contact her. Now, she's pregnant and considering whether to tell them.\n\nThe main factors here are the safety and well-being of the author and the baby. If the family is abusive and controlling, contacting them could pose a risk. The author's decision to not inform them might be a protective measure. She mentions fear of their reaction, potential harassment, and the baby being affected by the family's behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows support. She's feeling guilt, but in a situation where the family is toxic, it's reasonable to prioritize her and the baby's safety. The family hasn't been part of her life, so not telling them isn't hiding information from a close relationship. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but her personal safety is more important.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the context of abuse. If someone is protecting themselves from abusers, it's usually seen as justified. The answer here is likely B (not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself and the baby from a harmful environment. There's no obligation to reconnect with abusive family members. The fear of future issues for the child is also a valid concern.\n"
