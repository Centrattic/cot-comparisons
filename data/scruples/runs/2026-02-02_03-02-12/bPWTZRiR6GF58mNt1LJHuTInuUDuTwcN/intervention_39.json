We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed. The author left her family because of control and abuse, including narcissistic behavior and a cult-like environment. She's been away for two years, only sporadic contact, and now is 37 weeks pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The family is described as controlling and abusive, invading privacy, controlling finances, and being extremely religious. The author fled for her well-being. Now, she's with a supportive partner and doesn't want to subject her child to that environment. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the current non-communication. The author isn't in contact with her family except for occasional messages that turn into yelling. She's worried about their reaction, judgment, and how they might treat her child. The question is whether not telling them makes her at fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, family responsibilities might be seen as important, but in cases of abuse, the priority is the individual's safety and well-being. The author hasn't cut them off completely, just hasn't told them during a period where communication has been minimal and hostile. The fear of negative reactions and potential harm to the child are valid concerns. The author is protecting herself and her child from harm, which is a reasonable action. The guilt comes from the societal expectation to involve family, but the context here is abuse, which complicates that expectation. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
