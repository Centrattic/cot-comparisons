We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family, who she's not close with. They have a strained relationship, with the mother being described as a narcissistic parent and the family being controlling and abusive. The author ran away two years ago because of the family's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the author and her family. The family is portrayed as toxic, controlling, and abusive, which is a significant factor. The author left home due to these issues and has built a life on her own. The boyfriend isn't pressuring her to tell them, but she feels guilty.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior towards her and the potential consequences of telling them about the pregnancy. The author is worried about their reaction, possible harassment, and the impact on her child. She's also concerned about the family's religious views and how they might treat her child. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, it's important for a person to prioritize their well-being and their child's safety. If the family is abusive and controlling, withholding information to protect oneself and the child is a reasonable decision. The author isn't in contact with them, so not telling them isn't hiding information in an ongoing relationship. The guilt she feels is understandable, but not necessarily valid given the circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the family has cut ties and is abusive, the responsibility isn't on her to maintain contact or share personal information. Protecting her child from a harmful environment is also a valid reason. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to tell her family. The answer should be B.\n"
