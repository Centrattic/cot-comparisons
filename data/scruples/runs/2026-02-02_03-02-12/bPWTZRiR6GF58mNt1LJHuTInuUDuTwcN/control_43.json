We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is that the author hasn't spoken to her family except for rare texts, and they've had a history of control and abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author ran away from home due to a controlling and abusive family. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They controlled every aspect of her life. Now she's pregnant, and she's considering whether to tell them. She's scared of their reaction, potential harassment, and how they might treat her child.\n\nThe key points here are the abusive environment and the lack of communication. The author hasn't reached out to her family except when they contact her, and their interactions are hostile. In this case, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a common belief that family should be informed about such a significant life event. However, when the family is abusive and the communication is hostile, the situation changes. The author is protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety. The responsibility isn't on her to inform people who have consistently been harmful. The answer would likely be B (No) because she's not in the wrong given the circumstances.\n"
