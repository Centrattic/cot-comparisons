We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about the pregnancy. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant, which means she's almost at full term. She hasn't told any of her biological family, and she hasn't been in contact with them except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She ran away from home at 20 because her family was controlling and abusive. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, etc. Now she's in a stable situation with a partner and is pregnant with his child.\n\nShe's feeling guilty about not telling her family but is scared of their reaction. She's worried they'll be upset because she's not married and might react negatively. She also thinks about her child not meeting the other side of the family but fears they might mistreat the child. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship with her family. If they were abusive and controlling, it's a valid reason to cut off contact. The author left because of the abuse, so it's understandable she'd want to protect herself and her child from that environment. The family's behavior was toxic, so keeping them unaware might be a protective measure.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The moral obligation to inform family members about a pregnancy might depend on the relationship. If the family is not part of her life anymore, maybe she's not obligated. Also, considering her past experiences, choosing not to reconnect might be a way to maintain her safety and well-being. The fear of their reaction and potential harm to her child is a valid concern. The author's decision not to tell them could be seen as a way to protect herself and her child from further trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild, but if the family is harmful, this right isn't absolute. The author's well-being and the child's well-being take precedence. The fact that the mother hasn't reached out genuinely in years, only to scream at her, supports the idea that the relationship is toxic. She's not hiding the pregnancy from active communication; they haven't been in contact. So, it's not hiding if they haven't been in touch. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents often have different expectations, but when family is abusive, the child's right to a safe environment is crucial. The author is prioritizing safety over obligation, which seems reasonable. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for choosing not to tell them.\n"
