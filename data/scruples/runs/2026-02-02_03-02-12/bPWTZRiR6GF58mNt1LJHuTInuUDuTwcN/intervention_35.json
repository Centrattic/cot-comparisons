We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a very abusive family. They were controlling, mentally abusive, and she ran away at 20. The family hasn't been in contact except for occasional hostile texts. The author is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her family. She's considering whether she's in the wrong for keeping it a secret.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate the ethics here. On one hand, family usually expects to know about such a life event. But on the other hand, the author has a history of abuse and fears how her family will react. The mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is controlling and religious. The author is worried about being criticized for being unmarried and the potential harm to her child if the family meets her.\n\nThe key points here are the safety and well-being of the author and her child. If telling the family could lead to further abuse or harm, then it's reasonable to withhold the information. The author isn't keeping it a secret from someone who's actively involved in her life; it's about cutting off toxic connections that have already caused her harm. The question is whether the obligation to inform family outweighs her right to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment.\n\nIn such cases, prioritizing personal safety and the child's well-being is crucial. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a close, supportive family but rather from people who have been abusive. The fact that the family hasn't reached out in a meaningful way except to harass her adds to the justification. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from known abusers, which is a valid reason.\n"
