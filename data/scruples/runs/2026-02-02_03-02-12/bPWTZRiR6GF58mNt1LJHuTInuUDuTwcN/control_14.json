We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe woman is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They're not on speaking terms except for rare, hostile texts. She ran away from home two years ago due to a controlling, abusive family environment. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were very controlling, even to the point of checking car mileage and controlling her bank account. She now has a stable life, a happy relationship, and is pregnant with her partner's child.\n\nHer boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell the family. She feels guilty about not telling them but is terrified of their reaction. She worries they'll accuse her of hiding it, call her names because she's unmarried, and that her baby might later resent her for not having the other family in her life. But she's scared the child would face the same abuse she did.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. So, the key points here are the history of abuse, the family's controlling behavior, and her current situation where she's safe but choosing not to engage with them. \n\nFrom her description, the family isn't actively part of her life. They haven't been in contact except for hostile messages. She left because of the abuse. In such cases, prioritizing her well-being and her child's is understandable. The family's potential reaction is a valid concern. If they were abusive and controlling, revealing her pregnancy could lead to more conflict or harm. Also, the child's safety and emotional well-being must be considered. If the family is hostile or judgmental, withholding information might protect the child from a negative environment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family has a right to know about their grandchild, but in this context, the family isn't supportive. The author's decision to cut off contact was a necessary step for her own mental health. Continuing that to protect the child makes sense. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but in her specific circumstances, it's reasonable to avoid contact. She isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's actively part of her life; the family has already disengaged, except for hostile interactions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The priority is her and her child's safety and well-being, given the abusive family history. The responsibility isn't on her to maintain a relationship with a family that was harmful. Her choice to not disclose is a protective measure, not a wrong one.\n"
