We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. Her family has a history of being controlling and abusive. She ran away when she was 20 because of the mental abuse and the family's controlling behavior. Now she's in a happy relationship and pregnant, but she's torn about whether she should tell her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't exactly supportive. They haven't been in contact except for occasional hostile messages. She left because they were abusive, so maybe she has valid reasons not to want to reconnect. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them about her pregnancy.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, family obligations can vary. If someone has cut off contact for valid reasons, like abuse, it's not necessarily wrong to keep the distance. She's protecting herself and the baby from potential negative reactions. The family might react with anger, blame her for being pregnant outside of marriage, or treat the child poorly. That's a real concern. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild, but if the family has been abusive and controlling, the priority is safety and well-being. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are involved in her life; it's about estranged family members who have been harmful. \n\nAlso, the idea of \"hiding\" might not apply here since there's no contact. The last time they spoke was hostile, so she isn't actively concealing it from ongoing relationships. The fear of how they might treat her child is another significant factor. \n\nSo, considering the abusive background, the lack of current contact, and the potential harm from informing them, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a decision to protect herself and her child from a toxic environment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
