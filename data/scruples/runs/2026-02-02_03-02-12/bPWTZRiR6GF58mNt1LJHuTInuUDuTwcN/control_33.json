We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't told her family because they have a complicated relationship. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and mentally harmful. The author ran away at 20 due to abuse, so there's a history of trauma. The main reasons she hasn't told them are fear of their reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and worries about her child being affected by the family's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is understanding her reasoning. She's not hiding the pregnancy from someone who's actively involved in her life; they haven't spoken in a long time. The family's last interactions were hostile. Also, she's protecting her child from possible abuse. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone has a history of abuse and you're protecting yourself and your child from that, it's justified. The family hasn't reached out in a meaningful way, so it's not like she's cutting them off without cause. She's prioritizing her well-being and her child's, which is responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be informed, but if the family is toxic, withholding information can be a form of self-preservation. The guilt she feels is valid, but her reasons for not telling are rooted in protecting herself and her child from further harm. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's a positive presence; it's the opposite. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
