We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty intense. The author left their family because of controlling, abusive behavior, including a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They're 37 weeks pregnant, so it's a late stage. They're considering not telling their family at all because they're scared of the reaction, especially given their past experiences and the family's strict religious views. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, but they feel some guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are the family's history of abuse and control. The author has been cut off from their family except for occasional hostile contact. The family's reaction is likely to be negative, given their past behavior. The author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm or emotional distress. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family members about a pregnancy unless there are specific circumstances, like if the family is involved in the child's care. Ethically, it's more complex. If the family is truly abusive and the author has a valid reason to fear their reaction, then not telling them isn't necessarily wrong. The author is prioritizing their well-being and their child's, which is a common justification in cases of toxic family dynamics. \n\nThe author mentions the fear of their baby being treated the same way they were. That's a significant concern. In many similar cases, people cut ties to protect their children from harmful influences. The fact that the author has a stable life now with a supportive partner suggests they are making choices that benefit their family. \n\nHowever, some might argue that cutting off entirely could lead to the family making assumptions or taking legal action if they become aware of the child's existence. But given the author's description of their family's behavior, it's more likely that informing them would result in immediate conflict and emotional harm rather than support. \n\nSo, considering the context of abuse and the author's need to protect themselves and their child, the answer is probably B. They are not in the wrong because they have a legitimate reason to avoid contact with their family to prevent harm and are not obligated to inform them if it's in their best interest.\n"
