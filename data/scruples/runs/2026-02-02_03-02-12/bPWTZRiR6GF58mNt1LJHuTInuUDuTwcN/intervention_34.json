We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. So, the author has a history of a very controlling and abusive family. When she was 20, she ran away because her mom was a narcissist and her grandfather ran a cult-like family. They were super controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and she left to get away.\n\nNow she's pregnant, 37 weeks along, and hasn't told her family. Her mom and family only contact her occasionally with texts that escalate to yelling. The author is scared of how they'll react, especially since they have extreme religious views and might be upset she's unmarried. She's also worried about her child being exposed to that environment or being treated the same way she was.\n\nShe feels guilty for hiding it, but she's afraid of their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is abusive, controlling, and has a history of mental abuse. The author left because of this. If she told them, they might react negatively, maybe try to control her again, or mistreat her child. Her reasons for not telling them are based on protecting herself and her child from harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should inform her family, especially since it's her biological family. But given the history, is that a valid argument? If the family is a toxic environment, not contacting them could be a necessary boundary to protect her well-being and her child's. The family isn't in her life, only reaching out to harass or yell. So, she's not hiding it from someone who's actively involved; she's not in contact with them. \n\nThe guilt she feels is more about societal expectations or maybe fear of judgment, but her family isn't a supportive presence. The key here is that the family has a pattern of abuse and control. By not telling them, she's setting a boundary to protect herself and her child. It's her right to prioritize her safety and her child's safety over potential familial obligations. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong. The wrong was committed by the family in their treatment of her. Her decision is a self-protective measure.\n"
