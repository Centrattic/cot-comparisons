We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The context is that they have a very toxic family situation. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like structure with extreme religious views. The person ran away because of this abuse and hasn't contacted them since, except for occasional texts they get. They're now pregnant and considering whether to tell their family, but are scared of the reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the family dynamics. The mother is a narcissist, the grandfather runs a cult-like family, and they've been controlling. The person left at 20 to escape the abuse. So, the family isn't just distant\u2014they're harmful. The author is in a stable relationship and has a child now. They're not avoiding contact; they're only getting occasional texts from family, which turn into yelling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom. The key factors here are the harmful nature of the family. In such cases, cutting off contact is often seen as a protective measure. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from an active relationship but from a family that's been abusive. They also mention fear of the family's reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and concern for the baby's future interactions with the family.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the family is harmful, the author isn't obligated to reconnect. The guilt they feel is likely due to societal expectations or internalized pressure, but the reality is that their safety and the child's well-being are at stake. The answer would hinge on the idea that you don't have to maintain relationships that are damaging. Since the family hasn't reached out in a healthy way and the author has left due to abuse, not telling them isn't wrong. The author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're justified in their decision to avoid contact with an abusive family.\n"
