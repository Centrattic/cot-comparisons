We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the author's family is described as controlling and abusive. She ran away because of a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling even when she was living at home. Now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child, and she hasn't told her family. The main issue is whether keeping this a secret makes her at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I should consider that. The key factors here are the family's behavior towards her. They haven't been supportive, and their communication is hostile. The author has a valid reason to be scared\u2014her family might react negatively, especially regarding her being unmarried and the potential treatment of her child. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since the family has a history of abuse and control, it's reasonable for her to protect herself and her child from further harm. Not telling someone who has been abusive isn't necessarily wrong, especially when there's no meaningful relationship. The author isn't hiding it from someone who's actively part of her life. \n\nAlso, the idea that it's not hiding if they haven't talked in months makes sense. They reach out only to harass her, so the responsibility isn't on her to update them. Additionally, she's considering her child's well-being, which is a strong point in her favor. The fear that her family might treat the child the same way she was treated is a legitimate concern. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The family's behavior justifies her decision to keep the pregnancy secret. There's no obligation to share such a personal life event with people who have been harmful and are not part of her life.\n"
