We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that she's in a family where she had a very controlling and abusive upbringing. She ran away when she was 20 because of the mental abuse and the family's controlling behavior. Now, she's in a stable relationship and pregnant, but hasn't told her family. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She describes her family as abusive, with a narcissistic mom and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They controlled her life, invaded her privacy, and she left because of that. The last interactions were hostile, with them screaming at her when they reached out. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the lack of communication, and her fear of how they would react. She's not hiding the pregnancy from an ongoing relationship but from a family that has been toxic and controlling. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. \n\nThe mother's responsibility isn't to be in a good relationship with her family to inform them. The author's well-being and her child's safety are more important. The family's behavior is abusive, so she's justified in protecting herself and her child. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, but given the context, she's protecting herself from potential harm. So the answer should be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
