We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. They left their family because of controlling and abusive behavior. The family is described as narcissistic, religious, and controlling. They haven't contacted the family much since leaving, and when they do, it's confrontational.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that hiding the pregnancy isn't wrong because the family hasn't been involved. They're scared of the reaction and the potential for abuse towards the child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell. They feel guilty but question if it's hiding if there's no contact.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the family isn't part of their life anymore. The user didn't leave the family; the family cut them off through their behavior. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they're in contact with. The fear is valid given the family's history. They're protecting both themselves and the child from possible harm. The moral obligation to inform might be less when there's no ongoing relationship. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
