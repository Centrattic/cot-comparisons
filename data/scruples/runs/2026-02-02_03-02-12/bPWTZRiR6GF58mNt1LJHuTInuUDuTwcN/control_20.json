We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed, so I need to parse through all the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author left home two years ago because of a controlling, abusive family. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is extremely religious with a cult-like structure. They controlled her life from when she was 20. Now she's pregnant, 37 weeks along, and hasn't told her family. She's scared of their reaction, especially their judgment about her being unmarried. She's also worried about her future child being affected by her family's behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the lack of a healthy relationship with her family. The author has been on speaking terms only when her family contacts her, and even then, it's negative. The family's behavior has been invasive and controlling. The author has a new, stable life with a supportive partner. \n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a very abusive family situation. She's not obligated to maintain a relationship with people who have been harmful. The fact that the family hasn't been supportive and have a history of abuse means that withholding information isn't necessarily wrong. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's future, which is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family is important and that she should tell them. But given the context of the abuse and the lack of a healthy connection, it's reasonable for her to want to protect herself and her child. The guilt she feels is understandable, but the circumstances don't make her wrong for choosing not to contact her family.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are the abusive environment, the lack of a healthy relationship, and her right to protect herself and her child from potential harm."
