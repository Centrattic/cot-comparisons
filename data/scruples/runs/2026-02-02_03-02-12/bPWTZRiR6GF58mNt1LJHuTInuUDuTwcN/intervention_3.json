We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago due to controlling and abusive behavior. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and were highly religious with extreme values. The author has since built a stable life with a partner and is now 37 weeks pregnant. She's considering not telling her family, fearing their reaction and the potential impact on her child.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. The author has not been in regular contact with her family, only occasional texts that devolve into arguments. The family hasn't reached out in a supportive way. The author's reasons for not telling them are rooted in self-preservation and protecting her child from potential abuse. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to privacy, and there's no obligation to share personal news with estranged or abusive family. The author's fear is justified given the family's past behavior. The question of whether she's in the wrong hinges on intent and circumstances. Since she's protecting herself and her child from harm, it's reasonable to say she's not in the wrong. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations about family bonds, but when those bonds are toxic, prioritizing one's well-being is valid.\n\nAlso, considering the child's future, the author is concerned about the family's treatment. If the parents were abusive, exposing the child to that environment could be detrimental. The decision not to involve them is protective. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which adds that she's making this choice independently without external pressure.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the context of abuse and the victim's right to safety. Here, the author's actions are defensive. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
