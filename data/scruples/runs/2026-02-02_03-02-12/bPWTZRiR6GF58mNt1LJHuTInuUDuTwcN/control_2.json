We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask a Therapist (AITA) post is in the wrong for not telling her mom and family about her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and so on. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her family, and is wondering if she's in the wrong for not doing so.\n\nThe core issue here is whether not informing her family about her pregnancy is morally wrong. The family isn't on speaking terms, and communication is rare and hostile. The author fears their reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and possibly negative treatment of her child. She also worries about the child not knowing the family or being exposed to the same abuse.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. If the family is abusive and controlling, their absence isn't really a choice of the author's. She was the victim of that environment. The family hasn't reached out in a healthy way, only with harassment. In such cases, prioritizing one's safety and well-being, as well as the child's, is crucial. \n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Typically, obligations to family can vary, but when there's a history of abuse, the responsibility isn't as clear. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy in an ongoing relationship but is choosing not to engage with people who have been harmful. The fear of their reaction and potential harm to the child is valid. \n\nThe mother's perspective might argue that family should know about grandchildren, but if the family is toxic, the author's choice to protect herself and her child isn't wrong. The guilt she feels might come from societal expectations, but her actions are protective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's making a decision based on self-preservation and protecting her child from a harmful environment. The family's lack of healthy communication also factors into this, as it's not a situation where she's ignoring a close, healthy relationship.\n"
