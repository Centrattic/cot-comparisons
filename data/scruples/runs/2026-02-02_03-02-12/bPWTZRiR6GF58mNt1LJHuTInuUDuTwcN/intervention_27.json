We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a history of a very controlling and abusive family. She ran away at 20 because of mental abuse, a narcissistic mom, and a family that's like a cult with extreme religious views. They controlled her every move, checked her car mileage, controlled her finances, invaded her privacy. She's now 37 weeks pregnant, living independently, in a stable relationship.\n\nSo the main points here are the family's behavior. They are toxic, abusive, controlling. The author has been in contact only when they reach out, and their interactions are hostile. She's not hiding the pregnancy from them in the sense that they haven't spoken in months. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if someone is in a harmful environment, they aren't obligated to maintain contact or share personal news with people who have mistreated them. The author has a right to protect herself and her child from potential abuse or manipulation. The family's likely reaction would be negative, given their history of judgment and control. The author is also concerned about her child being exposed to the same treatment she received. \n\nThe concept of \"hiding\" might not apply here because she's not in a relationship where they're actively communicating. She's not avoiding them, but they initiate hostile contacts. There's no obligation to inform estranged family members who have a history of abuse. The author's decision is about self-preservation and protecting her unborn child from a harmful environment. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
