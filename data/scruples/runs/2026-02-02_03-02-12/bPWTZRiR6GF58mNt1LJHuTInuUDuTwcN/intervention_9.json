We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her family. She ran away from home when she was 20 because of a controlling and abusive environment. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family isn't on speaking terms except for rare, negative interactions. The author left due to abuse, so the relationship isn't healthy. She's now in a stable relationship and is pregnant. The guilt is about not telling her family, but she's afraid of their reaction. She's worried they'll react negatively, criticize her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child.\n\nThe key points are the history of abuse, lack of healthy communication, and the author's fear of negative consequences. The mother hasn't reached out consistently, and the existing contact is hostile. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy if there's no contact. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, prioritizing one's safety and the child's well-being is crucial. Since the family has been abusive and controlling, sharing the news might lead to more harm. The author is protecting herself and her unborn child from potential abuse. There's no obligation to maintain relationships that are toxic. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her personal experience justifies her choice.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so there's no external pressure from him. The author is conflicted between societal norms and her personal history. The answer likely hinges on the context of an abusive family. In such cases, not informing them isn't wrong. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
