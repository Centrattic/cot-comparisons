We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author hasn't spoken to her family for a long time due to a controlling and abusive environment. She ran away years ago and has built a life with her boyfriend. The family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's family isn't in regular contact; they reach out occasionally but it's hostile. The mother is a narcissist, and the grandfather is described as running a cult-like family. The author left because of this abuse. Now, she's pregnant and considering whether to tell her family.\n\nThe key points are: the family initiated contact, which is negative, and the author left due to abuse. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. From an ethical standpoint, if there's no active relationship, maybe it's not her responsibility to inform them. Also, considering the potential harm to her child if the family is abusive, withholding information could be protective.\n\nBut there's a sense of guilt mentioned. The author feels guilty for hiding it, but since they haven't spoken in months, is it really hiding? The family hasn't been supportive, so the author isn't obligated to share. Also, the fear of the family's reaction and potential harm to the child is valid. The mother might blame her for being unmarried, which could be another layer of judgment.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the author has a duty to inform estranged family. If the family hasn't maintained a relationship, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Plus, protecting the child from a toxic environment is a valid reason not to involve the family. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
