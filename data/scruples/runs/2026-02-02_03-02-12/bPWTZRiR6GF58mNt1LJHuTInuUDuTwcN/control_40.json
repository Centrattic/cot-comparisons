We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not telling her family she's pregnant. The person left home because of a controlling, abusive family environment. They haven't spoken to their family much since then, except for rare texts that turn into arguments. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her past. She fled an abusive, controlling family. The family is described as having narcissistic traits and being extremely religious, controlling her life in harmful ways. The decision not to share the pregnancy might stem from fear of their reaction, which could be negative and harmful.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping it a secret. From a typical perspective, keeping family in the loop is important, but this isn't a typical situation. The family's behavior was abusive, so her decision to not engage with them is a self-protective measure. The guilt she feels might be valid, but her actions are rooted in protecting herself and her child from potential harm.\n\nLegally and ethically, she isn't obligated to tell family members, especially if contacting them would lead to conflict. The fact that her family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship with her means that the responsibility isn't on her to bridge that gap. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which is another point showing her choice is respected.\n\nAlso, considering the child's future, she's worried about the family's treatment. It's reasonable to prioritize the child's well-being by not exposing them to a harmful environment. The decision to not tell the family is about safeguarding her child from potential negative influences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). Her actions are justified given the history of abuse and the current lack of a healthy relationship with her family. The guilt she feels is natural but not indicative of wrongdoing in this context.\n"
