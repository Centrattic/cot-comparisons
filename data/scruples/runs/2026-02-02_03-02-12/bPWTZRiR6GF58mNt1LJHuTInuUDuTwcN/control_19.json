We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty complex. The author left their family two years ago because of a controlling, abusive environment. They mention their mom is narcissistic and the grandfather runs a cult-like family. The family is extremely religious and controlling, even checking car mileage and financials.\n\nThe author is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told their family. They feel conflicted because they don't want to put their child through the same treatment they experienced. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, but the author feels guilty. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not informing their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamics. The author fled an abusive situation, which is a significant red flag. The family's behavior includes invasion of privacy, control, and emotional abuse. The author's decision to cut off contact was likely necessary for their well-being. \n\nIn such cases, maintaining contact with an abusive family can be detrimental. The author's primary responsibility is to their own safety and their child's. If the family would react negatively, especially regarding the pregnancy and the child's future, not telling them might be a protective measure. The fear of the child being subjected to the same abuse is a valid concern. \n\nLegally and ethically, a parent isn't obligated to inform estranged family about their pregnancy unless there are specific legal ties or custody issues, which aren't mentioned here. The author has taken steps to build a life away from the family, which is a positive move towards independence. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but the reality of the family's behavior complicates that.\n\nThe key points are the history of abuse, the author's need to protect themselves and their child, and the lack of healthy communication with the family. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being over strained family ties. The answer should be B.\n"
