We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is that they left their family two years ago because of a controlling and abusive environment. The family is described as having a narcissistic mother and a grandfather running the family like a cult, with extreme religious views and control over every aspect of the person's life when they were younger. Now they're pregnant, in a stable relationship, and considering whether to inform their estranged family.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key factors here. The person has a history of abuse and has been estranged from their family except for rare, hostile interactions. The decision not to share personal news like a pregnancy would be influenced by past trauma and fear of negative reactions. The question is whether withholding this information makes them \"in the wrong.\"\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there might be a general expectation to inform family members about such a significant life event. However, the context here is crucial. If the family is abusive and the person has left to escape that environment, it's about their right to prioritize their well-being and that of their child. The author mentions fear of backlash, being judged for being unmarried, and potential harm to their child. These are valid concerns stemming from real experiences of abuse.\n\nThe mother's argument isn't just about not sharing news; it's about protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. In cases of domestic abuse or toxic family dynamics, the decision to cut off contact can be a necessary step for safety. The concept of \"hiding\" might be less relevant if there's no genuine relationship to maintain. The last interactions were hostile, so the lack of communication isn't the author's fault\u2014it's the family's behavior that's causing the estrangement.\n\nAdditionally, the author is considering the child's future. They're worried the child might face the same treatment they did, which is a parent's natural concern. Choosing not to expose the child to a harmful environment is a responsible decision. The author's primary responsibility is to their child's well-being, and keeping the family unaware might be the best way to ensure that.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on protecting themselves and their child from a harmful family situation. Society might judge based on family expectations, but when those family dynamics are toxic, personal safety and well-being take precedence. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
