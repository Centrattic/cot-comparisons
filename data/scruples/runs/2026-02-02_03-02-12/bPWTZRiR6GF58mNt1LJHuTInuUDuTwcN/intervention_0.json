We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They left home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive environment with a narcissistic mother and a cult-like grandfather. The family is very religious, controlling, and invasive. The person has been in contact only when the family reaches out, which is rare and hostile.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom. The key factors here are the family's behavior. The family was abusive and controlling, making the person feel unsafe. The author left because of that abuse. Now, they're scared the family would react badly to the pregnancy, especially since they are religious and might criticize the unmarried status. Also, they're worried about their child being exposed to that toxicity.\n\nThe author isn't avoiding contact out of spite, but because the family only reaches out to scream. The person is in a stable relationship, has a good life, and the child is from a loving relationship. The fear is about protecting the child from the same treatment they endured. The main conflict is between the obligation to inform family versus self-preservation and the child's well-being.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the family was abusive, the person isn't obligated to inform them. The harm from the family's reaction could be significant. The term \"AITA\" is about whether the person is at fault. Since the family was the source of the problem, the author isn't at fault for prioritizing their safety and their child's. The decision not to tell is based on protecting themselves and their child from further harm. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
