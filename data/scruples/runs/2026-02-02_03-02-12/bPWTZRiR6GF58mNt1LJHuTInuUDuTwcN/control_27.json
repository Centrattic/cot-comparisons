We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that she's 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They have a very strained relationship, with the mom being described as a narcissistic parent and the family being controlling and abusive.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior. They're controlling, invasive, and have a history of mental abuse. The user ran away at 20 due to this environment. Now, she's in a stable relationship and pregnant, but she's terrified of how her family would react if she told them. She's worried they'd blame her for being unmarried and might negatively impact her child. She hasn't had contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping this secret. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). The answer depends on the context of the family dynamics. If the family is toxic and abusive, withholding such personal information to protect herself and her child might be justified. The author's reasons are rooted in fear of harm and past trauma. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because she's prioritizing her well-being and her child's future over a hostile family relationship. So, the answer is B.\n"
