We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mother about being pregnant. The situation is that they have a strained relationship with their biological family, who are described as controlling, abusive, and religious. They left home at 20 due to the family's environment.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told their family, and the boyfriend hasn't pressured them. They feel guilty but fear the family's reaction, including potential abuse and negative comments about being unmarried. They also worry about the child's future if the family is allowed contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamics. The family's behavior is abusive and controlling. The author ran away because of it, so they've already chosen to distance themselves. If they told the family, it's likely to result in conflict, which could be harmful to both the author and the baby. The author's priority is their well-being and their child's safety, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe question is about \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole). The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing their family. In many cases, family is expected to be informed about such a significant life event. However, this is a situation where the family is not supportive, and contact is minimal and hostile. The author hasn't cut off contact entirely but only responds to rare messages, which might turn into screaming. \n\nThe author's reasons for not telling are based on fear of abuse and concern for their child's future. They are protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. While there's a societal expectation to inform family, in cases of abuse or toxic relationships, that expectation might not apply. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they are in regular contact with; the contact is already minimal and hostile.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they are prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being over a family that has a history of abuse. The answer should be B (No).\n"
