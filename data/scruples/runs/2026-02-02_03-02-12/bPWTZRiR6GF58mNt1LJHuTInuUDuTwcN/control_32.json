We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is pretty intense. The author had a really bad experience with their family, including a controlling, narcissistic parent and a cult-like family dynamic. They ran away at 20 because of the abuse and now they're pregnant. They haven't told their family, and they're scared of how they'll react. Their boyfriend hasn't pushed them to tell, but they feel guilty.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not informing their family. Let's break it down. On one hand, not telling family about a pregnancy can be seen as withholding information, especially if there's a history of contact, even if it's negative. But the context here is crucial. The family has a history of mental abuse, controlling behavior, and the author left because of that. They only get occasional hostile texts from their family, so the communication isn't healthy or supportive. \n\nThe author's reasons for not telling are legitimate fears based on past experiences. They're worried about their family's reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and the possibility of the child being affected by the family's toxic behavior. The author is also concerned about the child growing up without the option to know the family, but they're trying to protect the child from a harmful environment.\n\nIn these situations, the key factor is the well-being of the individual and the child. If the family is a source of harm, withholding information can be a protective measure rather than an act of wrongdoing. The author isn't actively lying because they don't have contact, but the question is whether the lack of contact changes the expectation to inform. Since the family doesn't maintain a healthy relationship, the obligation to inform might be less, especially if revealing the information would put the author and child at risk of abuse or undue pressure.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being over a strained family relationship. The answer should be B (No)."
