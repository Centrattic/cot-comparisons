We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and they're only in contact occasionally with hostile messages. She ran away from home due to a controlling and abusive family environment. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is very religious, controlling, and invasive. The author left, became independent, is in a happy relationship, and now is pregnant. She's scared to tell her family because she expects a negative reaction, possible judgment about being unmarried, and fears how they might treat her child.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. So, I need to consider the ethics here. The family isn't on speaking terms, and the author has a right to protect herself from abuse. The family's behavior is abusive and controlling, so cutting off contact is a valid self-preservation step. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone she's in a healthy relationship with; it's from people who have been harmful. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, you don't have an obligation to share personal news with people who have been abusive. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety by not involving a harmful family. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but in this case, her actions are protective. The baby's future is also considered, as she doesn't want the child to go through the same abuse. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (No), because she's not in the wrong. She's protecting herself from a toxic family. The responsibility isn't on her to inform people who have not respected her autonomy in the past. The family's lack of communication initiative also plays a role\u2014since they reach out only to harass, she isn't obligated to update them. The key points are the abuse history, self-protection, and the child's well-being. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
