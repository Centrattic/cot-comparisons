We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that the author has a very controlling and abusive family. They were involved in cult-like behavior, controlling her life, invading her privacy, and she left them two years ago. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told her family, and she's worried about their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamic. The family is described as extremely controlling and abusive. The author left because of this, and she hasn't had positive contact with them since. The key points are the abuse, lack of communication, and the potential harm from telling them about the pregnancy.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping the pregnancy secret. From a moral standpoint, if someone is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm or abuse, that's understandable. The family might react negatively, maybe even try to control the situation again, which could put both the mother and the child at risk. The author is prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being, which is a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be kept informed, especially for medical or legal reasons. But given the family's history, those reasons might not apply here. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from close contact; they don't speak often. So, the argument that she's hiding it might not hold in a context where there's no regular communication.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author feels guilty, but her fear is based on real past experiences. The potential for the family to criticize her for being unmarried or to harm the child is a legitimate concern. Protecting the child from a harmful environment is a strong ethical point.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while there's often an expectation to inform family, this is not a black-and-white situation. The author's circumstances are extreme, and her decision is rooted in self-preservation and protecting her child. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for choosing not to tell her family, given the risks involved.\n"
