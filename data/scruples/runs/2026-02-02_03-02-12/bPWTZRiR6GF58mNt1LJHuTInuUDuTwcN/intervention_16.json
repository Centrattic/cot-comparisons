We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author has a very toxic family history with controlling and abusive parents. She ran away at 20 due to the environment. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told her family because she's scared of their reaction. The family hasn't been in contact unless they send a rare, hostile message.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family is described as extremely controlling and abusive. The author left because of this. If she were to tell them now, there's a high chance they would react negatively, maybe even try to control her again. The mother is a narcissist, so she might twist the situation to blame the daughter. Also, the author is worried about her child being exposed to the same toxic environment she had. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The key points are the author's safety and well-being, as well as her child's. Since the family hasn't been in contact except for hostile messages, can it really be considered \"hiding\" if there's no regular communication? Also, the decision to cut off from an abusive family is often necessary for mental health. \n\nLegally, there might be obligations, but in terms of moral or social wrong, it's about the circumstances. The author is protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The guilt she feels is understandable, but if the family isn't supportive, her choice is valid. The answer should consider the context of abuse and the need for self-preservation. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
