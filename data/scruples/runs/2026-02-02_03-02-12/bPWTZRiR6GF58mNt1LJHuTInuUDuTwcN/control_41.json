We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nSo the person left home at 20 because of a controlling and abusive family. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. The person is now pregnant, and the boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell the family. They're scared of the family's reaction, possible judgment, and fear for their child's future with that family.\n\nThe question is whether not telling their family makes them the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is abusive and toxic. The person ran away to escape that environment. Maintaining contact with such family can be harmful. The user is protecting themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. The family hasn't been supportive or positive in their interactions. The person is also considering the child's well-being, not wanting them to go through the same treatment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, is there an obligation to inform family about a pregnancy, especially if the family isn't part of one's life? If the family isn't providing support and is a source of stress, it might be reasonable to not involve them. The person isn't hiding it from active contact; they have no regular communication. The family might interpret it as a secret, but if there's no meaningful relationship, then the person isn't necessarily in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nAlso, the potential for the family to react negatively, judge the person for being unmarried, and harm the child's well-being justifies the decision to not inform them. Prioritizing safety and mental health is important. The person's reasoning is valid given the history. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
