We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. Her mom is a narcissist, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were very controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and so on. Now she's pregnant, 37 weeks along, and hasn't told her biological family. She hasn't spoken to them except for rare texts where they end up screaming at her. The boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell them, but she's feeling guilty about hiding it. She's worried about their reaction, judgment, and the potential harm to her baby if they meet the family.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to evaluate the situation. The family has a history of abuse and controlling behavior. If she were to tell them, they might react negatively, which could be harmful to her and the baby. She's in a stable relationship, has her own home, and has been away from the family for two years. The family hasn't been involved in her life, except for occasional hostile texts. The decision not to tell them might be a protective measure for her and the child. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she has a duty to inform her parents about a grandchild. But given the context of abuse and lack of positive relationship, it's more about self-preservation. The fact that she hasn't been in contact except for negative interactions supports her decision. Also, her fear is justified based on past experiences. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her well-being and the baby's safety are more important.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because the circumstances involve protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. The family's behavior is toxic, and cutting them out is a reasonable choice.\n"
