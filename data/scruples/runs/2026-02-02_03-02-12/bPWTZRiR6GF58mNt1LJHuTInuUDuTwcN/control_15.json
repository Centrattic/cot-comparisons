We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether not telling her mom about the pregnancy makes her an \"asshole.\" \n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed situation. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. The family isn't on speaking terms except for rare, hostile texts. The family is described as controlling, mentally abusive, with a narcissistic mom and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The person ran away at 20 because of this. Now she's in a stable relationship, has her own life, and is pregnant.\n\nShe's considering if she's wrong for not telling her family. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her. She's scared of their reaction\u2014likely negative comments about her being unmarried, possible harassment. She also worries about her baby not having the chance to meet the family, but she doesn't want the child to face the same abuse she did.\n\nThe key factors here are the family's abusive behavior and the author's right to protect herself and her child. In such cases, cutting off contact for safety is often advised. The author isn't in a healthy relationship with her family, so not sharing personal news isn't necessarily wrong. The guilt she feels might come from societal expectations, but her well-being and the child's are more important.\n\nThe options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Based on the reasoning, since the family is abusive and the author is protecting herself and her child, B (not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
