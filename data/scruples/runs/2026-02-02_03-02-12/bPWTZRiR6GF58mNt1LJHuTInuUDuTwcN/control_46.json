We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their family, which sounds really toxic. They ran away at 20 due to controlling and abusive parents. The family is described as controlling, religious, and emotionally abusive. The person is now in a stable situation with a partner and is 37 weeks pregnant.\n\nThe main points here are their history with the family and their current situation. The user is conflicted because they feel guilty for not telling their family, but given the past abuse, they fear the reaction. They\u2019re worried about being blamed for not informing the family during their occasional, hostile interactions. Also, they\u2019re concerned about their child not having the chance to meet the family, but they\u2019re afraid the family would be harmful to the child.\n\nFrom what I know about family dynamics, especially in cases of abuse or neglect, the priority is the safety and well-being of the individual and their child. The family hasn't been supportive, and the person has left that environment to create a better life. The decision to not involve an abusive family in their child's life is often seen as a protective measure. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's been part of their life regularly; the family hasn't reached out consistently except to be hostile. So, they\u2019re not in the wrong for choosing to protect themselves and their child from potential harm. The guilt they feel might stem from societal expectations of family ties, but in this context, it's about safety. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
