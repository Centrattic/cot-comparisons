We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that she's 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. The family isn't in regular contact; they only occasionally text, which often turns into arguments. \n\nThe user mentioned that two years ago, she ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive family environment. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is extremely religious, controlling, and invasive. After leaving, she's now in a stable job, a happy relationship, and is pregnant. She's conflicted about whether she's hiding the pregnancy by not telling them, but she's terrified of their reaction and how they might treat her child.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, the question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family has a history of abuse and control. The author left because of the toxic environment. The family doesn't reach out in a healthy way\u2014they only contact to harass or scream. Given this, the author's fear is valid. The family's potential reaction could be negative, possibly harmful to both the mother and the child. \n\nThe author hasn't been in regular contact, so the pregnancy isn't being hidden in an active way. The family hasn't asked, and she's not in a position to have a constructive conversation. The fear of the family's response and the desire to protect the child from a harmful environment are strong reasons for her decision. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if a family is abusive, it's not the child's responsibility to maintain contact. The mother is prioritizing her and her child's well-being by not exposing them to potential harm. The question is whether not informing them is wrong. Given the circumstances, it's a protective measure rather than a selfish act. \n\nHowever, some might argue that cutting off completely without any communication could be seen as avoiding responsibility or not being honest. But in the context provided, the family's behavior justifies the mother's actions. She's protecting herself and her child from further abuse. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). The key points are the history of abuse, the fear of negative reaction, and the intention to protect the child. The family isn't a supportive one, so her decision is understandable and justifiable.\n"
