We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their family, especially their mom, who's described as a narcissistic parent. The family is controlling, religious, and the person ran away because of the abuse.\n\nThey haven't spoken to their family except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The question is whether not telling them about the pregnancy makes them at fault. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family's behavior is abusive, and the person left for their own well-being. The fear of how the family would react is a key point. The author is scared they'll blame them for being unmarried and that the child might be treated poorly. Also, the family hasn't reached out in a meaningful way; their communication is minimal and hostile.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for keeping the pregnancy secret if the family isn't part of their life? The family isn't maintaining a healthy relationship. The author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. In such cases, it's reasonable to prioritize one's safety and well-being. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from an active relationship but from estranged, abusive family members. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). They have valid reasons to protect themselves and their child from a toxic environment.\n"
