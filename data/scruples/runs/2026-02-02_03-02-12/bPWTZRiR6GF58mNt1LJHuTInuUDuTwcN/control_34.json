We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Internet post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author hasn't told her biological family because they have a very strained relationship. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive family environment. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is controlling and religious. They haven't communicated much, only occasional texts that turn into screaming. She's now pregnant, with her boyfriend, and is considering whether to tell her family.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The key points here are her reasons for not telling. She's afraid of how they'll react, their history of abuse, and potential negative impact on her child. \n\nIn terms of ethics, family obligations can vary. But in cases where there's a history of abuse or manipulation, the person might prioritize their well-being and their child's. The mother has a right to make decisions about her body and her child, especially if the family is not supportive. Also, considering the child's future, she's worried about the family's treatment, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, if the family is toxic and non-supportive, withholding information to protect herself and her child isn't necessarily wrong. The concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often depends on the situation. In this case, the author has valid reasons rooted in her personal safety and the child's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), she's not in the wrong. Her decision is based on protecting herself from potential harm and ensuring her child isn't subjected to a harmful environment. There's no obligation to maintain contact with family that's abusive. The fact that her family hasn't been supportive makes her choice understandable.\n"
