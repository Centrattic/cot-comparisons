We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about not telling her mom about being pregnant. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They aren't on speaking terms except for rare texts that turn into arguments. She left home at 20 because of a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as a narcissist, the grandfather as part of a cult-like family. They were controlling, invaded her privacy, and she's been living on her own since then. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell her family, but she feels conflicted.\n\nShe's scared of their reaction\u2014probably judgment about being unmarried, and how they'd treat her child. She's worried the child might suffer the same abuse she did. The main issue is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nSo, the key factors here: the family's behavior towards her in the past, the current lack of communication, and her reasons for not telling them. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety over family contact. The family hasn't reached out except to scream at her. If they haven't been part of her life for a long time, does she have an obligation to inform them? Also, considering the potential harm if they do find out, maybe she's protecting her child from a toxic environment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, societal expectations might push for keeping family informed, but in cases of abuse or neglect, the priority shifts to self and child protection. The author is making a choice based on her past experiences and fear of negative consequences. The question is whether her decision is morally wrong, not legally. Since the family hasn't been supportive, and contact has been harmful, it's more about her right to protect herself and her child.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. Her decision is based on valid fears and self-preservation, not just avoidance without reason.\n"
