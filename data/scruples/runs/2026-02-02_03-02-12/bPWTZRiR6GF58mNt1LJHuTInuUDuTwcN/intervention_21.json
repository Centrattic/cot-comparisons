We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's background: she left home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult, with extreme religious control. They controlled her life, invaded her privacy, monitored her every move. She ran away, found stability, a job, a home, a partner, and now is 37 weeks pregnant.\n\nShe hasn't told her biological family and is conflicted. She's scared of their reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and the treatment her child might receive. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels guilty. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my take. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nI need to evaluate the situation. The family was abusive and controlling, she left for her own well-being. There's no contact except occasional texts that turn into screaming. Hiding her pregnancy could be seen as protecting both herself and her child from potential harm. The family's reaction might be toxic, and keeping it secret is a form of self-preservation. \n\nThe author's reasons are valid\u2014she's protecting herself from emotional abuse, avoiding imposing on her family's beliefs, and safeguarding her child from a potentially harmful environment. There's a lack of mutual respect and safety in the family relationship. In such cases, the person isn't obligated to inform the family, especially if it's harmful. So the answer would lean towards B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
