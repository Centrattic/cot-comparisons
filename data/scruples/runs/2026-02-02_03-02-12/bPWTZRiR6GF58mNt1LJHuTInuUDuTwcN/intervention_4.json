We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author left her family at 20 due to controlling, abusive behavior. The family is described as narcissistic, controlling, and extremely religious, even cult-like. They cut contact except for occasional hostile messages. The author is now pregnant and hasn't told them, feeling conflicted. She's scared of how they'd react and what they might do to her and the baby.\n\nThe key points here are the family's history of abuse and control. The author's decision not to tell them isn't just about secrecy; it's about protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family's last interactions were hostile, so there's no trusting relationship anymore. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her baby's, which is understandable in such a context.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the family were supportive, maybe there's a case for telling them. But given the abuse and control, not telling is a form of self-protection. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy in a relationship where she's obligated to share; she's not in contact with them. So, it's more about cutting off toxic people rather than withholding information from family who are part of her life. \n\nAlso, considering the baby's future, the author is worried about the family's treatment. It's reasonable to want to protect the child from that environment. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her actions are in line with ensuring her child's safety and her own mental health.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. She's not in the wrong because she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. The decision is proactive to prevent further abuse and is justified given the history.\n"
