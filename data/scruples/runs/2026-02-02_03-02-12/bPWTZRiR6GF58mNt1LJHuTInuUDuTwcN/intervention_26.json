We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author hasn't told her family because they were abusive and controlling. She ran away because of her family's behavior, and now she's worried about telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The family is described as abusive, controlling, with a narcissistic parent and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The author left home at 20, found her own stable life, is in a happy relationship, and is pregnant. She hasn't told her family because she fears their reaction, potential abuse, and the impact on her child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks B is correct, but they want my input.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision is based on self-protection and protecting her child. The family's history of abuse and control suggests that telling them could lead to negative consequences. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who is part of her life; she's choosing not to reconnect with people who've been harmful. The concept of \"hiding\" might not apply if they haven't had contact in months and they're not part of her current life.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to know about their child, but if the family isn't legally recognized as part of her life anymore, maybe that's a factor. But the question is about being in the wrong morally. The author's reasons are valid due to the family's behavior. Also, the fear of the child being affected by the family's treatment is a strong point. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's, which is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong because her decision is justified by the need to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment.\n"
