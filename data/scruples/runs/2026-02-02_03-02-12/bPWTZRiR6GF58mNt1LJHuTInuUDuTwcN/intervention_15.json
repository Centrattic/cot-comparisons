We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The family has a history of controlling and abusive behavior. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, the family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive. The mother is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. The person ran away at 20 due to this environment. Now, they're in a stable situation with a partner and a baby on the way.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for keeping their pregnancy secret. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nThe family hasn't been in regular contact, only occasional hostile texts. The author is afraid of how they'll react, including possible blame for being unmarried and how they might treat the child. The author is also worried about the child being affected by the family's behavior.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, withholding information can sometimes be seen as wrong, but context matters. If the family is toxic and the author has valid reasons for not engaging with them, it's more about self-protection and the child's well-being. The author's decision is based on past trauma and fear of harm, which are significant factors.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured them, which suggests they're making a conscious choice. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but the situation is more about protecting themselves and the child from a harmful environment. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's actively involved in their life; the family has been absent and hostile.\n\nIn such cases, the priority is personal safety and the child's future. The author's choice to not share the news is a protective measure. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
