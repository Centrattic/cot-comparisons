We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong for not telling her mother about her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author left home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive family environment. The family is described as extremely controlling, narcissistic, and cult-like, with the mother being a narcissist. They haven't had meaningful contact in years, only occasional texts that turn into arguments. \n\nThe author is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her family. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but is afraid of their reaction. She's worried about the family's judgment, the potential harm to her unborn child, and the possibility of her family repeating the abuse with the child.\n\nSo, the main points here are the history of abuse and the lack of communication. The question is whether keeping the pregnancy secret makes her \"the asshole.\"\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author is prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being over family obligations. The family's behavior was abusive, so cutting off contact is a form of self-preservation. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a healthy, ongoing relationship but from abusive family members who have a history of control and harassment.\n\nThe guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations that one should share such news with family. However, in this case, those family members aren't part of her life in a healthy way. The decision not to tell them isn't about hiding but about protecting herself and her child from potential harm.\n\nAdditionally, the author isn't being pressured by her boyfriend, which suggests that this is her autonomous choice based on her experiences. The fear of how the family would react\u2014judging her for being unmarried, their potential harm to the child\u2014supports her decision.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about balancing familial obligations against personal safety. Since the family posed a threat, her choice to remain silent is understandable and self-protective. There's no clear \"wrong\" here because the context of abuse and neglect complicates the typical expectations of family communication.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. Her actions are a reasonable response to her traumatic family dynamics.\n"
