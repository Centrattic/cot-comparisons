We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author hasn't spoken to her family much since leaving due to a controlling, abusive environment. She's 37 weeks pregnant, so that's almost due time. The family is described as controlling, religious, and possibly abusive. The mother is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty about not telling them but is scared of their reaction. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her. She's worried they'll react negatively, call her names, and that her baby might later resent her for not having contact with the other family. She's also afraid of how they might treat her child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family obligations versus personal safety. In many cases, people have the right to make decisions about their personal lives, especially if their family is toxic. The author left the family because of abuse, which is a valid reason. Hiding a pregnancy could be seen as withholding information, but if the relationship is already severed, maybe it's not her responsibility to inform them. Also, protecting the child from potential abuse is a priority. If the family would treat the child poorly, keeping them away might be the right call.\n\nHowever, some might argue that children should have contact with both sides of the family. But in this context, the family is not supportive and has a history of abuse. The author's decision could be seen as protecting her child from a harmful environment. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but her priority is her child's well-being and her own mental health.\n\nAnother angle is whether she's hiding it or just not sharing due to lack of contact. Since they don't communicate except for brief, hostile messages, maybe she isn't hiding it because they aren't part of her life. The term \"hiding\" might imply intentional secrecy, but if there's no active contact, it's not hiding. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a decision to protect herself and her child from a harmful family situation. The answer is B.\n"
