We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They have a history of a very controlling and abusive family environment. The parent is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling, even to the point of monitoring the person's activities like car mileage and bank account.\n\nThey left home at 20 due to the abuse. Now they're in a stable relationship and pregnant. The question is whether not telling their family about the pregnancy makes them the asshole (AITA). The person feels guilty but is terrified of the potential backlash. They're also worried about how the family might treat their future child.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. The family hasn't been in contact except for occasional aggressive texts. The person hasn't initiated contact, which suggests they're protecting themselves from further harm. The family's last interactions were hostile, so there's no real communication. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the family's behavior is the root issue here. The person is prioritizing their safety and the safety of their child. The decision to not share such a personal and significant life event with a family that has a history of abuse isn't about hiding; it's about self-preservation. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but the reality is that the family isn't supportive and could be harmful. \n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured them, so there's no external pressure from their partner. The fear of the family's reaction and the potential impact on the child are valid concerns. The person is making a conscious choice to protect themselves and their child from a toxic environment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a rational decision based on their past experiences. The family's actions are the problem, not the decision to withhold information. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
