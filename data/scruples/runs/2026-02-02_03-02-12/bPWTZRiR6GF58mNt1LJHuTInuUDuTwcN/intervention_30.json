We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author describes a very abusive and controlling family. Her mom is a narcissist, her grandfather runs the family like a cult, and they were extremely controlling. She ran away at 20, found her own life, got a job, a home, a partner, and is now pregnant. She hasn't told her family because of fear of their reaction. She's worried they'll blame her for hiding it, call her names, and potentially harm the child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels guilty.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior. They're not in her life; they only reach out to scream at her. She's in a stable relationship and has built her own life. The question is whether withholding the pregnancy from an abusive family is wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get blamed for not communicating with family, but in this case, the family is actively harmful. The author is protecting herself and her unborn child from potential emotional or psychological harm. The family isn't supportive, so keeping it a secret isn't a betrayal when they weren't part of her life. Also, the author is considering the child's future, which shows she's thinking long-term. \n\nThe guilt comes from societal expectations that you should always tell family about such a big event, but in this context, the family isn't a safe space. The answer should focus on the abusive environment and the author's right to protect herself and her child. The mother's \"right\" to know isn't a valid reason if it's harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
