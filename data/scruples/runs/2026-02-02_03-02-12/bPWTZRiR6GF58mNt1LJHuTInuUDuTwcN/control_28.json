We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty intense. The author ran away from home because of a controlling, abusive family. The mother is described as a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling and abusive.\n\nThe author is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her family. She's worried about how they'd react\u2014probably negatively, given their history. She's feeling guilty but also afraid of the consequences. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamics. If the family has a history of abuse, control, and harassment, then it's reasonable for the author to prioritize her and her child's safety by not contacting them. There's a concept called \"emotional abuse\" where not speaking to someone who was abusive isn't necessarily the wrong choice. Also, the author is in a healthy relationship now, so her decision might be based on protecting her new life from toxic influences.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the societal expectation that family should know about a significant life event like a pregnancy. But if the family isn't supportive and has been harmful, that expectation might not apply. The author isn't in contact with them; they only reach out to criticize. So, from her perspective, not telling them isn't hiding\u2014it's avoiding conflict and protecting herself and her child.\n\nAnother angle is the child's future. The author is worried the child might be exposed to the same treatment. That's a valid concern, and parents have the right to protect their children from harmful environments. The fear of the child hating her later is also part of this, but if the family isn't a positive influence, maybe it's better they don't know.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her past experiences and to protect her well-being and her child's. The answer should be B (No).\n"
