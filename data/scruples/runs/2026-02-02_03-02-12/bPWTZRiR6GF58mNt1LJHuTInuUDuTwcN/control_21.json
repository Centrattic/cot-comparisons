We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling her mom and family about being pregnant. The situation is that she left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. She's now pregnant, and her family only contacts her to scream at her. She's torn between guilt and fear of their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family relationship. The user mentions that her family is abusive, controlling, and has a history of mental abuse. She ran away because of this, which suggests that the family environment is toxic. In such cases, cutting off contact is often a necessary step for the individual's well-being. \n\nThe question is whether keeping the pregnancy secret is wrong. If the family hasn't been part of her life and has only been hostile when they do contact her, then maintaining distance could be a valid choice. The user is protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm. \n\nAlso, the family hasn't reached out in a supportive way, so the absence of communication isn't her fault. The fact that they blame her when they do contact her adds to the complexity. If she were to tell them, they might react negatively, as she's already anticipating. The user is also concerned about her child being exposed to the family's behavior, which is a valid fear given the history.\n\nLegally and ethically, a person isn't obligated to inform estranged family members of personal news, especially if doing so would risk harm. The user has the right to prioritize her safety and her child's well-being. The guilt she's feeling might stem from societal expectations, but her circumstances are unique and require her to make a self-protective decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She has valid reasons for not informing her family, given the abusive context and the potential risks involved.\n"
