We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked \"Am I the A**hole?\" (AITA) is in the wrong for not telling her family about her pregnancy. The situation is that she left her family two years ago because of a controlling, abusive environment. Now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family, who she has minimal contact with. She's worried about their reaction, potential judgment, and the impact on her child. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The user left her family due to abuse, which is a significant factor. The family isn't reaching out to support her but rather to scream and harass. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are part of her life; they haven't been in contact for months. So, is it hiding if they don't communicate regularly?\n\nThe user is considering whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The key points here are the nature of the relationship, the history of abuse, and the potential consequences of disclosure. The family is described as controlling and religious, which could lead to harsh judgment. The author is also worried about her child being affected by the family's influence.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family about a pregnancy unless there's a custody or legal issue, which isn't mentioned here. Emotionally and ethically, the decision hinges on safety and well-being. Since the author's past experiences indicate that contact with her family is harmful, choosing not to disclose seems protective, not wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which suggests some support. The fear of future resentment from her daughter is valid, but if the family's behavior is potentially harmful, withholding that information might be in the child's best interest. The author isn't hiding it from people who are part of her daily life; the family isn't involved. The question of whether it's hiding is moot if there's no communication.\n\nSo, based on the context, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
