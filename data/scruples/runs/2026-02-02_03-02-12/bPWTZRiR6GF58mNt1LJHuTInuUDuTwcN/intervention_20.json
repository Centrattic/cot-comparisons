We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. Let's start by understanding the situation they presented.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told any of their biological family. They mention that they aren't on speaking terms with their family, except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. The family is described as controlling and mentally abusive. The mother is a narcissistic parent, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading privacy, controlling finances, etc. The author ran away at 20 and is now living independently, in a happy relationship, and pregnant.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, but the author feels conflicted. They're scared of how the family would react\u2014accusing them of hiding the pregnancy, being judgmental about being unmarried. Also worried about the baby's future with the family. They feel guilty but question if it's hiding if they haven't talked in months.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, consider the family's behavior. If they were abusive and controlling, it's reasonable for the author to not want to reconnect. The author's safety and well-being are important. The family hasn't been supportive; instead, they've been hostile. In such cases, maintaining distance is often advised by counselors. The author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. \n\nThe family hasn't reached out in a constructive way. The occasional texts are hostile, so there's no positive relationship to maintain. The author's decision to cut off contact is a form of self-preservation. Choosing not to share big life events with people who have been toxic makes sense. \n\nThe guilt the author feels might stem from societal norms about family obligations, but in cases of abuse, these norms don't apply. The author's priority is their own and their child's safety. The fear that the baby might not get to know the other side of the family is valid, but if the family is harmful, it's better to protect the child. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the lack of a healthy relationship, and the author's right to prioritize their own and their child's well-being. There's no obligation to reconnect with people who have been harmful. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not telling their mom. The answer should be B.\n"
