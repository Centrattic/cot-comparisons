We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The author has a complicated relationship with her family. She left home due to controlling and abusive parents, specifically a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They're very religious and have a history of controlling her life. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told them. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but fears their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author has a valid reason for not telling them. The key points are the abuse and control she experienced. If the family is still likely to be abusive or harmful, withholding information might be a protective measure. Also, she hasn't had contact except for occasional hostile texts. The concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) here hinges on whether her decision is morally wrong given the circumstances.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family's past behavior suggests they might react negatively, possibly in a way that's harmful. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows he respects her boundaries. The guilt she feels is understandable, but if there's no meaningful relationship, is it really hiding? She's not in contact, so not sharing the news doesn't affect them in an active way. The fear that the child might miss out is valid, but if the author believes the family would harm the child, keeping them away could be protective.\n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the family is abusive and the author is protecting herself and her child, then she's not wrong. The answer would be B. People might argue she should try to reconnect, but given the history of abuse, it's a personal choice and not morally wrong. The key is the safety and well-being of the author and her child. So the answer is B.\n"
