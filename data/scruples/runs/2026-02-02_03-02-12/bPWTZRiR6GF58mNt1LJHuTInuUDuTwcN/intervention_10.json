We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the family is abusive and controlling, and she left them two years ago. They only contact her occasionally in a hostile way. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told them, and is conflicted about whether she should.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The family is described as controlling, abusive, narcissistic, and part of a cult-like structure. The mother is a narcissist, and they controlled every aspect of the author's life. She ran away at 20, found a stable job, a supportive boyfriend, and now is pregnant. She's worried about how they'll react if she tells them. The family would likely be critical of her being unmarried and might harm the child. She's scared for her child's well-being if the family is involved.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the family's behavior. The author has a valid reason to fear their reaction. Withholding information from toxic family members isn't inherently wrong when it's to protect oneself and the child from harm. The author isn't hiding it from someone who is actively involved in her life but from people who have been abusive and uninvolved. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her priority is protecting her child and herself. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which suggests she's making an autonomous decision. Also, the family's hostility and lack of positive engagement mean that not informing them isn't a betrayal but a protective measure. The question is whether she's in the wrong, and given the context of abuse, the answer is likely B (No). The author is not in the wrong because she's prioritizing safety and well-being over a toxic relationship.\n"
