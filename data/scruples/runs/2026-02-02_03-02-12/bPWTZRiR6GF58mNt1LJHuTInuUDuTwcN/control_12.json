We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago due to controlling and abusive behavior from her mother and grandfather. The family is described as extremely religious, controlling, and even cult-like. The author is now in a happy relationship and pregnant, but hasn't told her biological family. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but also scared of their reaction and the potential impact on her child.\n\nI need to consider the reasons behind her decision. The family's history of abuse and control is a significant factor. If she told them, they might react negatively, maybe even try to control her pregnancy or the child's upbringing. The author's safety and the child's well-being are primary concerns here. She's also worried about her child being subjected to the same treatment she experienced. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the family's behavior is problematic. They haven't maintained a healthy relationship with the author, often being hostile when they do contact her. The author isn't in contact with them, and they reach out occasionally in a negative manner. \n\nThe question is whether not telling them makes her in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if keeping the pregnancy secret protects her and her child from harm, then it's a justified decision. The family's right to know is often cited in such cases, but when there's a history of abuse, the priority shifts to the safety and well-being of the mother and child. \n\nThe author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a healthy relationship but from a toxic one. The decision not to disclose is a protective measure. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
