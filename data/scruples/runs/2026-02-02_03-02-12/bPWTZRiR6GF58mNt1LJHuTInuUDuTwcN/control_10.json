We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 37 weeks pregnant but hasn't told their biological family. The family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional hostile texts. The family is described as controlling, abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather running the family like a cult. The author ran away at 20 due to this and has since built a stable life with a supportive boyfriend. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell the family. The author is conflicted between guilt and fear of the family's reaction, including potential abuse and the child being affected similarly.\n\nSo, the main factors here are the family's history of abuse and control. The author's decision not to tell them could be seen as a protective measure for both themselves and the baby. The family's last interactions were hostile, so there's no active communication. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they regularly interact with, so the term \"hiding\" might not apply here. The fear of the family's reaction, including not accepting the pregnancy due to being unmarried and the potential harm to the child, adds to the complexity.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether there's an obligation to inform a family member about one's pregnancy, especially under these circumstances. In many cases, people have the right to make personal decisions, especially when involving their safety and their child's well-being. If the family has been abusive and non-supportive, the author isn't obligated to share this information. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but the situation is not straightforward. The author has a valid reason to protect themselves and their child from potential harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to tell the family, given the history. The answer should be B (No).\n"
