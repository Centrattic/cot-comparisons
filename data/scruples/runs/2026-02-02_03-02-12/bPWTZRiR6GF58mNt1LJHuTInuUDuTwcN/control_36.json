We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They haven't told any family members, and the family is described as controlling and abusive. The user left home at 20 to escape a narcissistic parent and a controlling family environment. Now they're pregnant, in a loving relationship, and considering whether to inform their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't on speaking terms except for rare, hostile interactions. The main issue is the history of abuse and control. The person's decision not to share the pregnancy might stem from valid fears of retaliation, judgment, or the well-being of their child.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a moral standpoint, if someone has been in an abusive situation, their choice to protect themselves and their child from that environment isn't inherently wrong. The obligation to inform family might be expected in a healthy relationship, but in an abusive context, prioritizing safety is key.\n\nThe user's guilt is understandable, but they're not obligated to risk their mental health or their child's safety. The answer should reflect that their decision is justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong, so the answer is B.\n"
