We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation involves a family that's described as controlling and abusive. The author left home due to mental abuse and now wants to avoid contact because of past trauma. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The mother is a narcissist, and the family is controlling and religious. The author isn't in any normal contact with them; the only communication is occasional texts that turn into yelling. The family hasn't reached out to support her\u2014they just criticize. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault for not sharing the pregnancy. From a moral standpoint, if someone has been cut off and not involved in your life, it's reasonable to prioritize your safety and well-being. The author's decision to keep the pregnancy private could be seen as self-preservation, especially considering the potential harm the family might cause to her and her child.\n\nThe user might argue that cutting off family is wrong, but in cases of abuse, maintaining contact can be detrimental. The author's fear is justified given the family's history. Also, protecting the child from potential abuse is a valid reason to not involve the family. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform estranged family about a pregnancy. Emotionally, the author is doing what's best for herself and her child. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her actions are protective. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on past experiences and protecting her child from a harmful environment.\n"
