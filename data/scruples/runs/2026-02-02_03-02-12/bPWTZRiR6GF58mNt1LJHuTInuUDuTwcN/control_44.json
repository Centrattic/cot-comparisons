We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They left their family two years ago because of a controlling and abusive environment. Their mom is a narcissist, and the family is very religious and controlling. They haven't spoken to their family much except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. Now they're 37 weeks pregnant and considering whether to tell them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The user's reasons for not telling their family are based on past trauma and fear of how the family might react. They left home due to abuse, and the family's behavior suggests they might not be supportive. The question is whether not telling them makes the user in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. In such cases, maintaining distance for one's safety and mental health is often advised. The user isn't in contact with their family except for rare, negative interactions. The act of not sharing the pregnancy could be seen as a protective measure rather than a deliberate lie. The family isn't part of their current life, so withholding information might not be a betrayal but a boundary.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But if the family is harmful, prioritizing the well-being of the child and oneself is crucial. The user is also worried about the child being affected by the family's behavior. The decision not to tell them is rooted in preventing potential harm, which is a valid reason.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone is in a harmful situation, they aren't obligated to share personal information that could lead to more harm. The user's actions are about protecting their child and themselves from a family that has been abusive. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
