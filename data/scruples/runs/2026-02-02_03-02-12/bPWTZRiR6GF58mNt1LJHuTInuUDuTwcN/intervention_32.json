We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. She had a very bad experience with them\u2014her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is controlling, abusive, and runs like a cult. She ran away when she was 20 because of the control and abuse. Now she's with a boyfriend who makes her happy and they're expecting a child. She hasn't told her family because she's scared of their reaction. They don't really talk, just occasional texts that turn into screaming. She's feeling guilty but also afraid of how they might react, especially regarding the baby. She's worried they might label her as a liar or say bad things about her because she's unmarried. Also concerned about the baby growing up without knowing the other side of the family or facing the same treatment she did.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the family's behavior. They were controlling and abusive. The author left after 20 years of that. That's a valid reason to cut ties, especially if it's harmful. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family hasn't been supportive; their interactions are hostile. So, not sharing the pregnancy might be a form of self-preservation. Also, she hasn't had a positive relationship with them, so it's not like she's hiding it from people who are part of her life. The last contact was harassment, so she's justified in not wanting to engage.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should know about a grandchild, but if the family is toxic, that argument weakens. The author has a right to protect her child from potential abuse or trauma. Also, she's already made the decision to cut ties, so this is consistent with that choice. The guilt she feels might come from societal expectations, but her safety and her child's well-being are more important. The family's reaction could be extremely negative, leading to more stress and conflict. There's also the baby's future to consider\u2014avoiding an abusive environment is better for the child's mental health.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows he respects her decision. She's not hiding the pregnancy from active family members; they don't communicate. So, hiding isn't the right term here. The article asks if she's in the wrong, but her actions are a response to past trauma. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
