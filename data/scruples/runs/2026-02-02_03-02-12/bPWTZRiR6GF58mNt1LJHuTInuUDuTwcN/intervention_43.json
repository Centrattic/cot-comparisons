We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that the author left her family two years ago because of controlling and abusive parenting. Her family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather running the family like a cult. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. The author is now pregnant and hasn't told her family, and she's conflicted about whether she should.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the history of abuse and control from her family. Leaving the family for safety and autonomy is a valid reason. Her decision not to tell them could be based on protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The question is whether she has a responsibility to inform her family, especially considering the possibility of them being upset about her being unmarried, among other things.\n\nIn such cases, the right to autonomy and safety is crucial. If the family's reaction would be abusive or harmful, withholding information to protect oneself and the child is understandable. The fact that they haven't had contact for months and that any communication is hostile makes the situation more complex. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who is actively involved in her life; rather, it's a family that's been toxic and abusive. \n\nThe ethical angle here is about self-preservation versus familial obligations. While some might argue that family should be informed, given the context of abuse, it's a matter of protecting one's well-being. The author is not in a position where she's cutting off communication out of spite; rather, she's avoiding contact to prevent potential harm. The fear of the baby's treatment is also a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on self-protection and the well-being of her child. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
