He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother.\n\nSo, the key points here are intention and impact. The author didn't mean to be malicious but made a joke based on the cake's appearance. However, the brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions ruined his dish. The author now feels guilty, especially since they had been respecting the brother's dietary choices.\n\nOn one hand, the author's comment was a joke, maybe even playful, and the daughter was young and innocent. The whole family joining in might have been a fun moment for them. On the other hand, the brother's effort was disrespected. Even if it was a mistake, the outcome was that the brother felt his hard work was mocked. The author's history of teasing might mean this joke was more hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nBut the author says they've been respecting the brother's choices lately, so maybe they didn't intend to hurt him. Still, the impact is important. The brother was not amused, and the cake was ruined. The author might be in the wrong because they should have considered the brother's feelings and the significance of his effort. Even a joke can have consequences, especially when it affects someone's pride and effort.\n\nSo, it's a balance between the intent (not malicious) and the impact (hurting the brother). Depending on the context, the author might be in the wrong because they should have thought before making the comment, especially knowing the brother's pride in his creation. Alternatively, it could be seen as a harmless mistake. The answer might hinge on cultural norms around family teasing and the importance placed on respecting others' efforts.\n"
