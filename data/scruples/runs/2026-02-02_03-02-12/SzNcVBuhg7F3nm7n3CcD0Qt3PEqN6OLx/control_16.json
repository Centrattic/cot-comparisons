He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author, who usually gives the brother a hard time about veganism, jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty about ruining the vegan dessert part of the brunch.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The key points here are intent, the impact on the brother, and the family's actions. The author didn't mean to disrespect the brother's effort but made a joke that led to the cake being used as playdough. The brother was proud of his dessert, and the family's actions ruined it. Even though it was a joke, the author's comment was the catalyst.\n\nOn one hand, the author was just having fun, and the daughter was innocent. The family enjoyed the arts and crafts, and maybe it wasn't malicious. On the other hand, the brother put effort into making a special dessert, and the author's joke undermined that effort, even if unintentionally. The author acknowledges feeling guilty, which suggests some awareness of wrongdoing.\n\nBut in these AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or hurtful. Even if it was a joke, if it caused someone else emotional distress, they might be considered at fault. The brother was not amused, and the dessert's purpose was defeated. The author's history of giving the brother a hard time about veganism might add context, but the author claims they've been respectful lately. However, this incident might have been a slip-up.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, even if playful, did cause the brother distress and ruined his creation. The author's guilt also points towards them feeling they did something wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. Alternatively, if the family had a good time and the brother's feelings were the only downside, it's a matter of perspective. However, the brother's feelings are valid, so the author should take responsibility. Hence, AITA scenarios often side with the person who caused unintended harm, so the answer is A.\n"
