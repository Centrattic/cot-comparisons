He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh, and the father told his daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to use it as craft material instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a dessert, which the author found to look like Play-Doh. The author made a joke, which led to the family playing with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The main factors here are intent, the impact on the brother's feelings, and whether there was malicious intent. The author says they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately, but here it was a joke. The brother was proud of his creation, and the author's comment led to a situation where the cake wasn't eaten. But the author's intent wasn't to hurt; it was more of a playful comment that went too far. The daughter was young and innocent, and the family joined in. However, the brother's feelings were hurt, which is important. Even if it was accidental, the author might be responsible for not foreseeing the consequences. But since it was a joke and the author didn't mean to insult the brother, maybe not in the wrong. But the brother's effort was disregarded, leading to the cake being ruined. So, maybe AITA cases often consider the impact, so here the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the brother's feelings were hurt and the cake was wasted. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the joke was meant in good fun. But usually, these cases prioritize respecting others' efforts, so A might be the answer.\n"
