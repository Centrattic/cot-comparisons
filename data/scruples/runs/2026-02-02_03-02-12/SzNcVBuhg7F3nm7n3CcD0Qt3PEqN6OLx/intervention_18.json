He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The family then used it for arts and crafts, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty but isn't sure.\n\nSo, the key points. The author's intent was probably a joke, but the brother put effort into making the cake. The daughter is young, so she's innocent. The family joined in, which might have been fun for them but ruined the dessert for the brother. \n\nIs the author responsible? Well, they made a comment that led to the misunderstanding. But was it malicious? The author says they've been respecting the brother's choices lately. Maybe the comment was a slip-up. However, the brother's feelings were hurt. The author did enjoy making fun of the brother's vegan cake. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't maliciously ruin the cake; it was an accident. On the other hand, they could have realized the cake looked like Play-Doh and corrected the daughter instead of joking. Also, the brother's effort was wasted. \n\nBut considering the daughter's age and innocence, maybe the author didn't mean harm. Still, the brother's feelings matter. The author might be in the wrong for not preventing the misunderstanding once they saw it was happening. Maybe they should have stepped in after the first comment. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author knew the cake looked like Play-Doh and didn't correct the daughter, they might be partially responsible. But since it was a joke and they felt guilty later, maybe not entirely. The brother might have overreacted if the family had fun. But the author's joke did cause the brother's creation to be wasted. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author should have foreseen the consequences. Since they did say it was Play-Doh, leading the daughter to play with it, they might be in the wrong. However, if they thought it was a harmless joke and the brother is sensitive, maybe not. But the brother's effort was ruined, so the author should have considered that. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong). Wait, but maybe not. Since it was a mistake and not intentional, perhaps B (not in the wrong). \n\nWait, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm conflicted. The key is intent and harm. The author didn't intend to hurt, but the action caused harm. In some perspectives, they're in the wrong for not preventing the mistake once they made the comment. Others might say it was an accident and not malicious. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because it was a joke without malice, and the brother's sensitivity is part of it. But maybe A because the author should have realized the cake's intent and stopped the daughter. Hmm. The answer might be A or B. But the user's initial thought is B. I need to decide.\n"
