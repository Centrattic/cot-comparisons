He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, not being able to resist, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. Then the whole family started playing with it, and the brother was upset because his dessert wasn't eaten.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which is probably a big deal to him. The author says they've been giving the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been more respectful lately. Now, they're trying to be cool with it, but this incident happened. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's reaction ruined it. \n\nThe author's daughter is four, so she's young and might not understand the difference between food and Play-Doh. The author's comment was a joke, but it led to the whole family playing with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty about the fun they had at his expense.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the brother was proud of his dessert, and the author's comment led to not eating it. Even if it was a joke, the author didn't consider the brother's feelings. The brother's dietary choices might be important to him, and mocking his efforts, even in a playful way, could be seen as disrespectful. Also, the daughter is young, and the author's comment set off a chain reaction that ruined the brother's presentation of his dessert. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that they've been respecting the brother's veganism lately. Maybe they didn't mean to mock it, just found the cake visually similar to Play-Doh. The family was having fun, and maybe the brother was too sensitive. But the brother's effort was in vain because the dessert wasn't eaten, and the author had fun at his expense. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment was the catalyst. They should have considered the brother's feelings and maybe not made the comment, especially in front of the child. Even if it was a joke, it had real consequences. The brother might have wanted the family to eat his dessert, and the author's actions prevented that. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on the brother and the family's reaction.\n"
