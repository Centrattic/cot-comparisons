He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family Christmas brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, in a playful moment, told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to use it as crafting material instead of eating it. Now, the brother is upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author had previously given a hard time about. The author mentions that they've been respecting his choices lately, which is a positive point. But the joke about Play-Doh led to the family not eating the cake, which was the brother's main contribution. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they made a joke that was playful but might have been inconsiderate. The key factors here are intent and impact. The author didn't mean to ruin the cake on purpose, but the joke did cause the family to not eat it. The brother was proud of his creation, so the outcome was hurtful. \n\nHowever, it was a family setting, and kids can be playful. The author's daughter was just being a child, and others joined in, so maybe it was a light-hearted moment. But the brother might have felt disrespected or that his effort was wasted. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't intend harm, and family gatherings sometimes have jokes. On the other hand, the brother's feelings were hurt, and the author might have been insensitive to his effort. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because even if the intent was playful, the result was that the brother's effort was dismissed. The author could have considered the brother's feelings more before making the joke, especially since they had a history of teasing about veganism. So, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
