He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their daughter that their brother's vegan cake looked like Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating. The brother was upset because he was proud of his creation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they usually give their brother a hard time about his veganism but have been respecting it lately. This time, the brother made a bright green cake that looked and smelled like Play-doh to the author. The daughter, being young, took the author's word at face value and started playing with it. The family joined in, which upset the brother.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the brother was proud of his dessert, and the author's comment led to the family not eating it. Even though it was a joke, the author's action caused the brother's creation to be treated as a toy. However, the author might have thought it was harmless fun. The daughter is young, so maybe they didn't intend for it to go so far. But the author knew the brother's feelings about his veganism, so maybe they should have been more careful.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother chose to make a vegan dessert, which might not appeal to everyone, and the author's comment was based on the cake's appearance. The author might not have intended to ruin the brother's pride. The brother's disappointment is valid, but the author's actions were a joke that backfired.\n\nBut does that make the author wrong? It's a family setting, and sometimes humor can clash. The author might have thought the joke was light-hearted, but it crossed a line by disrespecting the brother's effort. The fact that the brother was upset suggests that the author's actions were inconsiderate, even if unintentional.\n\nHowever, the author was trying to be respectful of the brother's veganism, just in this case, made a joke based on the appearance. The daughter's innocent question led to a spontaneous reaction. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't mean to mock the brother's dietary choices but rather the dessert's appearance. Still, the outcome was negative for the brother. It's a tricky situation where intentions vs. impact come into play. The author might have a good intention, but the impact was harmful. But since it was a mistake and not malicious, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
