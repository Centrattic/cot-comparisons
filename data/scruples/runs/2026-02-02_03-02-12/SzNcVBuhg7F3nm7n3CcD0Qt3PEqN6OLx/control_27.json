He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about the author accidentally making their daughter think their brother's vegan cake is Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which he was proud of. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about his veganism but has been more respectful lately, said it looked like Play-doh to their daughter. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother and ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they had fun making fun of their brother's cake. But was it wrong? Well, the author didn't mean to ruin the cake on purpose. They just made a comment based on the cake's appearance, not intending for the family to play with it. However, their comment led to the child's misunderstanding, which then caused the family to not eat the cake. \n\nThe brother's feelings are hurt because his effort was dismissed. Even if the author didn't intend to be mean, their comment could be seen as mocking the brother's choice. The vegan cake might have been a personal effort to contribute to the family meal, and the author's reaction undermined that effort, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were just being playful and that the brother should have explained the cake was for eating. But since the brother was proud of his creation, expecting people to eat it is reasonable. The author's comment, while maybe a joke, caused a situation where the brother's effort was wasted.\n\nSo, considering that the author's action, even if not malicious, led to the brother's efforts being disregarded, it's possible the author is in the wrong. They should have been more careful or checked with the brother before letting the daughter play with the cake. The key here is intent versus impact. Even if the author didn't mean to mock, the impact was negative on the brother.\n"
