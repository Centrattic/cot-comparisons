He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author joked that it was Play-Doh, and the kids took it seriously, leading the whole family to play with it. The brother was upset because his dessert wasn't eaten, and the author feels guilty about the fun they had at his expense.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. The author had a history of teasing the brother about veganism but has been respecting it lately. The comment was a joke, spontaneous, and the daughter took it literally. The family ended up using the cake as playdough, which the brother didn't appreciate. \n\nNow, considering intentions. The author didn't mean to ruin the brother's meal, but the joke led to unintended consequences. Was the joke mean-spirited? The user says they've been respecting the brother's choices lately, so maybe the comment wasn't malicious. But the brother took it as mockery, which could hurt his feelings. \n\nIs it the author's fault? The daughter was young and didn't understand the context, so the author might have been careless. The brother put effort into making the cake, expecting it to be eaten, so the author's joke undermined that. However, it was an accident and not done with ill intent. \n\nAlso, the family had fun, but the brother was upset. The author might be in the wrong for not foreseeing that the joke could hurt the brother's feelings. Even if it was a mistake, it's about respecting others' efforts. On the other hand, it's a family setting, and sometimes these things happen without malice. \n\nI think the key points are: the author didn't intend harm, but the action led to the brother's creation being wasted. The author's responsibility is in how they reacted. Since the brother was proud of his dessert, the author's joke, even if a joke, didn't consider the brother's feelings. So, maybe the author is partially at fault. But some might argue it's a harmless accident. \n\nIn the end, the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I have to decide between A and B. Considering the brother's perspective and the effort he put in, maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong). But if we consider the lack of malice and the accident, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
