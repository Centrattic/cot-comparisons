He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of giving the brother a hard time about his veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. Then the whole family ended up using the cake as arts and crafts, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, the author's intention might be important. Did they mean to mock their brother? The story says they've been cool with his veganism lately, but they still made the comment. Maybe they thought it was a joke, but it went too far. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's play destroyed it. So, the brother probably felt disrespected. Even if it was a joke, the result was that his effort was wasted, and the family had fun at his expense.\n\nBut then again, the author might not have realized the cake looked like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author answered based on appearance. Maybe they didn't intend to make fun of it. But given their history of giving the brother a hard time, it's possible the comment was a bit of teasing. The key point is whether the author should have known better. They might have known the brother's feelings about his veganism, so even a joke could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the family then used the cake as a toy. The author might be in the wrong because their remark led to the brother's dessert being treated as a toy instead of food. Even if it was an accident, the author's comment was the catalyst. The brother's pride was hurt, and the family's actions ruined his effort. The author probably should have checked with the brother first or not made the comment, considering the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the cake did look like Play-Doh. Maybe the author was just being honest in their opinion. But honesty isn't an excuse if it causes harm. The brother was there, beaming with pride, and the author's reaction was inconsiderate. The author's guilt suggests they feel bad about it, but does that mean they were wrong?\n\nHmm. The answer probably leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they made a comment that led to the family mocking the brother's effort, even if unintentionally. The brother was there, and the author's words started the whole chain. Their history of teasing might make it more about being inconsiderate, even if it wasn't malicious. So, A.\n"
