He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for accidentally making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author, known for making jokes about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh on a whim. The family then used the cake for arts and crafts, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are intent and consequences. The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch, but their comment led to the cake being treated as a toy. However, the brother was proud of his creation, and the joke backfired. The author might have crossed a line by not considering the effort the brother put into making the cake, even if it was a joke. On the other hand, the situation was accidental, and the author wasn't malicious. They also felt guilty afterward. \n\nBut humor can sometimes be a defense. If the family enjoyed the moment and the brother was the only one upset, maybe it's a matter of differing perspectives. However, respecting someone's effort, even in a joke, is important. The author's past teasing about veganism might also play a role here, even if they've been more respectful lately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be partially responsible. They could have foreseen that calling the cake Play-Doh might lead to it not being eaten, especially with a young child. Even if it was a joke, the consequence was real for the brother. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a bit of a grey area. However, since the action was accidental and not malicious, maybe B (not in the wrong) is possible. But the key here is that the author's comment directly led to the cake being played with instead of eaten. So, maybe they are in the wrong because they should have thought about the implications, even if it was a joke.\n"
