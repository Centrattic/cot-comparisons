He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh, and the parent joked that it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The parent feels guilty but isn't sure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent has a history of teasing their brother about being vegan but has been respecting his dietary choices lately. This time, the brother put effort into making a dessert, and the parent's offhand comment led to the family not eating it. The brother was upset, and the parent is now questioning their actions.\n\nOn one hand, the parent's intention was probably light-hearted, just a joke. The daughter was young and innocent, so the parent's reaction might have been a spontaneous, playful response. The parent mentions feeling guilty, showing they recognize the brother's feelings were hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother put effort into making a meal, and the comment undermined his effort, possibly in front of others. Even if it was a joke, it might have been disrespectful. The parent's history of teasing (though they say they've been cooler about it) might contribute to the brother's hurt feelings. The fact that the family didn't eat the dessert could be seen as dismissive of the brother's work.\n\nBut the parent might not have intended to mock the brother's veganism specifically. The cake looked like Play-doh, so the comment was more about the appearance than the dietary choice. However, the brother was proud of his creation, and the joke trivialized his effort. The parent's guilt suggests they see the issue, but is it their fault?\n\nIn terms of social norms, making a joke that leads to others not respecting someone's effort can be problematic. Even if it was a silly joke, if it made the brother feel disrespected, the parent might be at fault. However, it's a family setting, and sometimes playful teasing is part of family dynamics. The key is whether the parent's actions were malicious. The parent says they respect their brother's choices now, so the intent wasn't to mock his veganism, but the effect was still hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent might not be in the wrong because the joke was based on the cake's appearance rather than the dietary choice, and it was a genuine mistake. However, the brother's feelings were hurt, which might mean the parent should have been more careful. It's a bit of a grey area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's actions led to the brother's creation not being appreciated, even if unintentionally. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they failed to support their brother's effort, even if it was a joke. Or B (not in the wrong) because it was a harmless mistake with no malicious intent.\n\nI think the key here is intent. If the parent didn't mean to mock the brother's veganism and it was an honest mistake based on the cake's appearance, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the parent's history of teasing contributes to a pattern that could be hurtful, then it's a yes. The story says they've been cool with his choices lately, so maybe the intent was not to harm. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
