He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The person called it Play-Doh to their daughter, which led the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it, making the brother upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The brother put in effort to make a dessert, and the person, despite being respectful of his veganism, made a joke that led to the cake being ruined. The person's daughter took it literally, and the family ended up playing with it. The brother was not amused, and the event ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider intent and consequences. The author didn't mean to ruin the cake, it was accidental because the daughter misunderstood. However, the author did make a joke that led to this misunderstanding. But was the joke intentional? The person says they couldn't help it because it looked like Play-Doh. They might not have intended to cause harm, but maybe they should have been more careful with their words, especially around a child.\n\nAlso, the brother was proud of his creation. Even if the author was making a joke, the outcome was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author might be at fault for not considering how their comment could be taken. On the other hand, the daughter's action was innocent, and the author's comment was a joke. But since it led to the cake being ruined, there's a responsibility there.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, usually, the person is considered the asshole if their actions caused harm without regard for others' feelings. Here, the author's comment led to the brother's cake being destroyed. Even if it was a joke, they should have thought about the consequences. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the effort was wasted. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But some might argue it was an accident through the child's actions. However, the author's comment initiated the chain of events. So likely, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
