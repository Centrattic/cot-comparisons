He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan mung bean cake, and the author joked that it looked like Play-doh. The daughter took it seriously, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author says they've been giving the brother a hard time about his veganism but have recently been more respectful. This time, they made a joke without intending to be malicious. The daughter thought it was a game, so the family ended up playing with the cake. The brother was upset because his creation wasn't eaten.\n\nIs the author responsible? Well, they made a joke that led to the misunderstanding. But it was accidental. The key points here are intent and whether it was harmful. The brother's feelings were hurt because his effort was disregarded. However, the author didn't mean to disrespect him directly; it was a light-hearted comment that backfired. The family had fun, but the brother was left out. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the brother's feelings more. Even if it was a joke, knowing the brother's pride in his creation, the author might have realized that a joke could lead to this outcome. So there's some responsibility there. However, it's a family setting, and sometimes jokes happen. The brother might have overreacted, especially since the family was having fun. The author might not be entirely in the wrong but maybe partially responsible for not thinking through the consequences of the joke.\n\nBut the question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" If being in the wrong means they did something intentionally hurtful, then no. If it's about not being considerate enough, then maybe yes. The answer depends on the cultural context and how the family dynamics work. In many cases, light-hearted teasing is acceptable unless it's targeted or repeated. The brother might be the one being overly sensitive here. The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch but did end up hurting their brother's feelings. So maybe they are somewhat in the wrong. Alternatively, since it was a mistake and not intentional harm, maybe not. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide if the author's actions crossed a line. The joke led to the family not eating the dessert, which the brother put effort into. The author's comment was the catalyst. Even if it was a joke, it's possible they should have known better. So maybe answer A (in the wrong) because they contributed to the brother's distress. But others might argue it's a harmless mistake. I need to weigh the intent versus the impact. The impact was negative, but the intent was playful. In AITA scenarios, often intent matters, but impact is also considered. If the brother was significantly upset, the author might share some blame. Answer A or B? I think the correct answer is A because the author's comment led to the misunderstanding, even if unintentional. They should take some responsibility for not being more careful with their words. So the answer is A.\n"
