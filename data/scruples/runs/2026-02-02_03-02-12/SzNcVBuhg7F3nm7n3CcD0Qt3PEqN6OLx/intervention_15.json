He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a family Christmas brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nHmm. The author's intention was probably a joke, but the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted. The question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the author was making light of the brother's dietary choices, which could be seen as mocking. Even if it was accidental, the author's comment led to the family not eating the cake. The brother was proud of his creation, so having it treated as a toy might be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author says they've been respecting the brother's veganism lately. The comment was spontaneous and maybe not malicious. The daughter's innocent question led to the reaction. But the key here is the impact. The brother's cake was ruined, and the author enjoyed the situation. So while the intent might not have been to harm, the result was negative for the brother.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author should have foreseen the consequence. Since the cake was meant to be eaten, and the author's comment led to it being used as playdough, even if it was a joke, it's a bit of a misstep. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and the purpose of the dessert. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more thoughtful, even if it was a joke. The answer might be A.\n"
