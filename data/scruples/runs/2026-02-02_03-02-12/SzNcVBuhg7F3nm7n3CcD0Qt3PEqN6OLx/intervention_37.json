He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, and the whole family ended up playing with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author's intent was probably a joke or a playful comment, but the result was that the brother's dessert wasn't eaten, and he was upset. The brother put effort into making it, and the family's actions might have disrespected that effort. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue it was a harmless joke, especially with a young child involved. The brother's cake looked like Play-Doh, so maybe the reaction was understandable. But on the other hand, the brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions ruined it. The author's comment led to the cake being treated as a toy instead of food, which could be seen as mocking the brother's effort, even if unintentionally.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they've given their brother a hard time about veganism in the past but have been cooler lately. This might suggest that the comment wasn't entirely innocent, and there could be a pattern of teasing.\n\nHowever, the author felt guilty afterward, which shows they recognized the brother's feelings. The key question is whether the joke crossed the line into being disrespectful. Since the brother was upset and the cake wasn't eaten, there's a case that the author was in the wrong for not considering the brother's feelings and the effort put into the dessert.\n\nBut maybe the situation was light-hearted, and the brother should have anticipated that the cake's appearance might lead to some teasing. However, it's still important to respect someone's efforts, even if they're unconventional. So the author's comment led to the cake being treated as a toy, which disrespected the brother's intention. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
