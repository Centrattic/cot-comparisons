He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh, and the author told their daughter it was Play-Doh. Then the whole family ended up playing with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which is important to him. The author admits they've given the brother a hard time about veganism before but have been more respectful lately. This time, they made a joke that led to the family not eating the cake as intended.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intention was probably a joke, but the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted, and the family didn't respect his creation. The daughter was young and innocent, so maybe the author didn't mean to be malicious, but the action still caused harm. The author feels guilty, which suggests they recognize the potential wrongness.\n\nVeganism is a personal choice, and the brother was proud of his dessert. The author's comment made the family treat it as a toy, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if it was a joke, the outcome was that the brother's effort was undermined. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their comment would affect the brother, even if unintentional.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or family context where joking around is common. However, the brother was not amused, so the joke wasn't appreciated. The author's action led to the brother's dish being used in a way he didn't want. So, even if it was a mistake, the author should take responsibility for not thinking through the consequences.\n"
