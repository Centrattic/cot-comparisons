He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a family brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author had previously given him a hard time about. The author's daughter asked what the cake was, and the author jokingly said it was Play-doh. The family then played with it, which ruined the brother's dessert. The author now feels guilty.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a social perspective, the author's joke might have been intended as playful, but the brother was proud of his creation. The author's previous teasing about the brother's veganism adds context. Even if the author meant it as a joke, the outcome was that the brother's effort was wasted, and he was upset. \n\nIntention matters here. The author didn't mean to ruin the dessert, but the action did. However, the author might argue that it was a harmless joke and the brother's sensitivity is the issue. On the other hand, the brother made a special effort, and the author's comment led to the destruction of his work.\n\nThe daughter was young, so maybe the author didn't anticipate the extent the family would engage with the cake. But as a parent, the author might have known that playing with food isn't appropriate and that it could lead to such a situation. The author also mentions feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize the negative impact.\n\nIn similar situations, people often consider respect for others' efforts. Even if the author's intention wasn't malicious, the consequence was that the brother's work was wasted, which is a valid concern. The brother might feel disrespected, especially if the author had a history of mocking his veganism, even if it's not the case now.\n\nSo, while the joke might have been intended as light-hearted, the outcome affected the brother's feelings and the event's purpose. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact of their words on the brother's effort and feelings, even if it was unintentional.\n"
