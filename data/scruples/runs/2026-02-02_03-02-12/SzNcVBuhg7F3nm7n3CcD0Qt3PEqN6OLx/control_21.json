He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother made a vegan cake, which he was proud of. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism, called the cake Play-Doh, and the family ended up playing with it, which upset the brother.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't mean to be malicious, but they did have a history of giving the brother a hard time. Even if they were trying to be playful, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted, and he was upset. The author also mentions feeling guilty about enjoying the joke.\n\nNow, whether it's wrong depends on the intention and whether the action disrespected the brother's effort. Even if it was a joke, causing someone's hard work to be ignored or mocked could be seen as inconsiderate. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions likely hurt his feelings, even if it was unintentional.\n\nAlso, the daughter was young, so maybe she didn't understand, but the parent's role is to be more mindful. The author's comment set the tone for the whole family to play with the cake, which might have been a way to mock the brother's dietary choices under the guise of being playful with the kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions they've been respecting the brother's choices lately, so maybe this was an innocent mistake. But the impact is still there. The brother's effort was wasted, and the author enjoyed the joke, which shows some level of intent to tease, even if not mean-spirited.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because their action, though maybe not malicious, still disrespected the brother's effort and caused harm, even if unintentionally. The guilt they feel also suggests they recognize the wrongdoing.\n"
