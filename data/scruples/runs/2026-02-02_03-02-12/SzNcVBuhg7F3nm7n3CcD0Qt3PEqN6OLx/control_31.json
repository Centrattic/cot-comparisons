He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake is Play-doh. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism, said it was Play-doh to their daughter. This led the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's comment caused the misunderstanding, the brother's effort was wasted, and the family didn't eat the dessert. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe author's intention was probably a joke, but it backfired. They knew the brother had worked hard, and even though they've been more respectful recently, this incident caused harm. The daughter was young, so the comment wasn't malicious, but the outcome affected the brother's feelings. \n\nConsidering family dynamics, respecting others' efforts is important. Even if it was a joke, leading others to not eat the dessert was disrespectful. The author might be in the wrong for not thinking about the consequences. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the brother's dessert being unappetizing. However, the author had a history of giving a hard time, so this might have been a recurring issue. The author's role in the joke led to the problem, so maybe they are at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the situation was accidental, and the author had been trying to be respectful. The guilt mentioned suggests they feel responsible. But the brother's effort was wasted, which is a valid point against the author. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes), because the author's action led to disrespecting the brother's effort, even if it was unintentional. However, some might argue it was a harmless joke. But the outcome was negative, so likely the author is in the wrong.\n"
