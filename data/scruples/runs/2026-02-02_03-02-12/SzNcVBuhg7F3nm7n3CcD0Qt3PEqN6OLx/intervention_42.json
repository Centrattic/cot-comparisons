He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset because the cake was ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author admits they have a history of teasing their brother about veganism, even though they've been more respectful lately. The comment was made impulsively, in a moment of seeing the cake's appearance. The key here is that it was an accident, driven by the daughter's question and the cake's appearance. \n\nThen, the consequences. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions ruined it. The author feels guilty about the brother's reaction and their own enjoyment in the situation. However, the family had fun, but the brother's effort was wasted. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't intend to mock the brother, but the action led to a negative outcome. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the cake wasn't eaten as intended. The author's comment was based on the cake's appearance, not the dietary choice directly. However, the brother's pride and effort are important factors here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment started the chain reaction. Even if it was a joke, they should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the cake. The daughter's innocence doesn't absolve the author's role in making the statement. \n\nSo, while the situation was unintentional, the author's action led to disrespecting their brother's effort. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact of their words. But others might argue it was a harmless mistake. However, since the brother was not amused and it ruined the cake, the author's responsibility is there.\n"
