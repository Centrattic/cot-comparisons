He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they told their daughter their brother's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his dessert, and now they feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intent. The author didn't mean to mock the brother's veganism directly. They mentioned they've been respecting his dietary choices lately. The comment was a joke, maybe a bit of a playful one, especially since they were at a family brunch. The daughter is four, so her question was innocent. The author's response was probably just a knee-jerk reaction because the cake looked like Play-Doh. \n\nBut then, the family ended up using the cake for arts and crafts, which definitely wasn't the brother's intention. He was there to share his creation, and it was ruined. The author admits they had fun making fun of their brother's cake, which adds to the guilt. \n\nOn one hand, it's a family setting, and maybe the brother should have known how the cake might be perceived. But on the other hand, the author's comment did influence the family's actions. Even if it was a joke, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author might have overstepped by not considering the consequences of their words, especially in front of a child. \n\nBut the author didn't intend to disrespect their brother's veganism. They mentioned they've been cool with it. The comment came out as a reaction, not a malicious intent. The family had fun, but maybe the brother felt disrespected. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since they didn't mean to mock, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But they did cause the brother's dessert to be wasted. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could go either way. Some might say the author was in the wrong because they led the family to treat the cake as a toy, while others might see it as a harmless joke that backfired. The key points are intent, the brother's feelings, and the outcome. Since the author didn't intend to mock but still caused harm, maybe they are partially at fault. But since the joke was innocent and the brother's reaction is about pride, perhaps it's not entirely their fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the comment was a joke, not malicious, and the brother's feelings were hurt unintentionally. The author took responsibility and felt guilty, which suggests they care. But maybe the line is crossed because they didn't consider the impact. Hmm. I'm torn. The answer might be A if the action was clearly wrong, but given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
