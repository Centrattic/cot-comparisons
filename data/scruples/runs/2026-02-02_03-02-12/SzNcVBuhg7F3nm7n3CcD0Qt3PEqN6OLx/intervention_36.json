He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their 4-year-old daughter it was Play-Doh, and the whole family ended up using it for arts and crafts instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put a lot of effort into making the cake, and the author made a joke that led to the family not eating it. The author mentions they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices, so maybe they didn't mean to be malicious. The daughter is only four, so her question is innocent. The author's response was spontaneous, but it led to the whole family playing with the cake. The brother was upset because his creation wasn't eaten. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, on one hand, they made a joke that their brother found offensive. On the other, it wasn't intentional to hurt him, and the context is a family gathering. The brother's feelings were hurt because his effort wasn't respected. But the author might argue that it was a harmless mistake, especially with a young child involved. The key here is whether the joke crossed a line. The brother's pride was in his dessert, and the author's comment undermined that. Even if it was a joke, it had consequences. The author feels guilty, which suggests they recognize some wrongdoing. So, maybe the answer is A (yes, they're in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. Alternatively, maybe it's a family situation where the brother is being too sensitive, and the author isn't entirely at fault. But considering the brother's effort and the outcome, the author's joke led to the brother's dish being wasted. That's a valid reason for the brother to be upset. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the implications of their joke, even if it was unintentional.\n"
