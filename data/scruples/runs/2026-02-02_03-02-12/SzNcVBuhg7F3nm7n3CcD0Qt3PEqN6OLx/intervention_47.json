He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about his veganism but has been more respectful lately, called it Play-Doh to their daughter. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they enjoyed making fun of their brother's creation, even though they respect his dietary choices now. The question is whether they are at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author's comment was a joke, and the family ended up having fun with it. The brother was proud of his dessert, and it was ruined. The author's action directly caused the brother's dish to be used as a toy instead of being eaten. That could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the brother put effort into making it. Even if it was a joke, it might have crossed a line by not respecting his intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention might have been playful, not malicious. The daughter's innocent question led to a spontaneous reaction. The family's enjoyment could argue that it wasn't a malicious act. However, the brother's feelings are important here. Even if the author is not malicious, the outcome hurt the brother's feelings. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into the dessert. Maybe a better approach would have been to avoid the joke to prevent the situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: respect for the brother's effort, the impact on his feelings, and whether the joke was appropriate. The author's action, while possibly not intended to be mean, still caused the brother's dish to be ruined and might have been disrespectful. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not thinking about the brother's perspective and the effort involved.\n"
