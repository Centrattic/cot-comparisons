He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author jokingly calling their brother's vegan cake Play-Doh, which led the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, and the author made a joke that backfired. The key points here are intent and the impact. The author says they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices, so maybe the joke wasn't malicious. However, the action led to the brother's effort being wasted, and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the joke was at the brother's expense, even if it was meant to be playful. Family dynamics matter here. The brother was proud of his creation, and the joke undermined that. Also, the daughter was young, so she didn't understand it was a joke and acted on it, which the author didn't prevent. The family followed suit, which might have added to the brother's distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims it was accidental and that they didn't mean to mock the brother. The humor might have been intended as lighthearted. However, the result was still harmful to the brother's feelings. Even if the intent was playful, the consequence was significant. The author's responsibility here could be in not foreseeing the outcome or not stopping the family from playing with the cake once it started.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the impact of the action rather than the intent. So even if the author didn't mean to be cruel, the outcome caused the brother distress. The author might be in the wrong for not considering how the joke could affect their brother and for not stepping in to correct the situation when they saw it going wrong.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize the potential wrongdoing. The brother's effort was undermined, and the family's actions were disrespectful. So, even if the joke was meant to be funny, the result was hurtful. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
