He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading everyone to play with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they've been respectful of their brother's veganism lately, but this joke backfired. The daughter was young and innocent, so maybe the author didn't intend to be mean. However, the brother had put effort into making the cake, and the joke caused him distress. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they made a joke that led to the family not consuming the dessert, which was a gift from the brother. Even if it was a joke, it might have been insensitive. The brother was proud of his creation, and the author's comment undermined that pride. Also, using the cake as Play-Doh was a waste of his effort and possibly the ingredients. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended harm. The daughter's question prompted the response, and the family ended up having fun. But the brother's feelings were hurt. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since they admitted to feeling guilty, maybe they realize it crossed a line. \n\nConsidering intent versus impact, even if it was a joke, the impact was negative on the brother. So the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
