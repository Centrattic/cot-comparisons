He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The author, in a moment of humor, told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset because his dessert wasn't eaten, and the author feels a bit guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author has a history of teasing their brother about veganism but says they've been respectful lately. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the author's joke caused the family to not eat it. The question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Intentions vs. impact. The author's intention was probably a joke, but the impact was that the brother's effort was wasted, and the family didn't enjoy the dessert as intended. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's playtime with it might have been embarrassing or disrespectful. Also, the daughter's innocent question led to the author's quick, humorous response, which then snowballed into the entire family's actions.\n\nFamily dynamics play a role here. If the author has a history of teasing the brother, even if they've been more respectful lately, this might be a recurring issue. The brother's pride in his dessert being undermined by a joke could be seen as dismissive of his efforts. On the other hand, the situation might not be malicious; it was a joke that went too far, perhaps without malicious intent.\n\nAnother point: the brother's dietary choices are vegan, which might be a sensitive topic. The author's past teasing could make this incident more hurtful. Even if the author meant no harm, the effect on the brother's feelings is what matters. The family's actions led to the dessert not being eaten, which the brother clearly wanted to share. The author's role in initiating the joke that led to this outcome could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that it was a light-hearted moment that everyone enjoyed except the brother. But considering that the brother was proud of his creation, the author's joke, even if well-intentioned, might have been inconsiderate. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the impact, which might indicate they were wrong despite not intending harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have ill intentions, the action led to the brother's effort being wasted and his feelings being hurt. The author's responsibility in starting the joke that caused the family to not engage with the dessert as intended makes them at fault.\n"
