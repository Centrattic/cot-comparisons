He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found looked like Play-Doh. The author then joked that it was Play-Doh to their daughter, who took it literally and started playing with it. The entire family joined in, and the brother was upset because his dessert wasn't eaten. The author feels a bit guilty but thinks they aren't in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author has a history of teasing the brother about veganism but has been respecting it lately. The joke was made impulsively when the daughter asked what the dessert was. The daughter is four, so her literal interpretation makes sense. The family's reaction was playful, but the brother ended up upset because his effort was wasted.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the joke was in poor taste, especially since the brother had put effort into making the dessert for the family. Even if the author meant it as a joke, saying it to a child might have been careless. The author's admission that they enjoyed making fun of the brother's cake suggests a lack of consideration for his feelings. However, the author didn't intend to ruin the dessert; it was an accident caused by the daughter's innocent action. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might have been expected to present his dessert in a way that's clearly edible. But the cake looked like Play-Doh, so maybe the presentation was unclear. Still, the author's comment directly led to the misunderstanding. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author's responsibility lies in not thinking through the consequences of their joke, especially in front of a child. \n\nHowever, it's also a family setting, and sometimes jokes can backfire. The author might not be entirely at fault if the brother's dessert was deceptive in appearance. But the key point is that the author's comment was the catalyst. The answer depends on whether the joke was a reasonable family interaction or a thoughtless action that disregarded the brother's feelings. \n\nI think the author made a mistake by making that comment to a child, which led to the misunderstanding. They should have considered the brother's feelings and the potential outcome. So, the answer leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) makes sense. But if the cake's appearance was the main issue, maybe B is possible. However, the author's role in initiating the joke is significant. So, probably A.\n"
