He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they made their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author says it was an accident. They mentioned they've been giving their brother a hard time about veganism before but have been more respectful lately. So maybe they didn't mean to be malicious here. The comment was spontaneous when the daughter asked a question. \n\nBut then, even if it was an accident, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family used it as playdough. The author feels guilty. So, even if it wasn't intentional, was there negligence? The author saw the cake and recognized it looked like playdough. They didn't correct the child's assumption. Instead, they went along with it. That might have been a lack of consideration for their brother's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's dessert was vegan, and maybe the texture and color were similar to playdough. The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch. The family just had fun with it. However, it's possible that the brother put a lot of effort into making the dessert as a vegan option, and the author's actions undermined that. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and the impact. The impact was negative on the brother, but the intent was not to be mean. However, the author didn't check if the sister would be okay with the joke. Also, a four-year-old is innocent, so the parent should be more cautious. \n\nIn similar situations, people often say that even if it's a joke, if it hurts someone's feelings, it's the person's responsibility. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the consequences. But since it was an accident, maybe not. \n\nBut the author does feel guilty, which suggests they think they might have done something wrong. The family had fun, but the brother was upset. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions, even if not malicious, were careless. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong because they didn't correct the child and allowed the family to play with it, despite knowing it was their brother's effort.\n"
