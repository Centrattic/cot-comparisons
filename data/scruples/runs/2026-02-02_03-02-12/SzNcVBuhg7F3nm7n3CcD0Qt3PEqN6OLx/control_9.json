He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading to the family using it as an art medium.\n\nFirst, the context is a family brunch. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, known for teasing the brother's veganism, joked that it was Play-Doh. The kids started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty because their joke ruined the dessert's purpose.\n\nNow, determining if the author is wrong. They intentionally made a joke that led to the cake being used in a way the brother didn't intend. Even if it was a prank, they had a history of teasing, which might have crossed a line. The brother was proud of his dessert, so the author's actions disrespected his effort. The author should've considered the brother's feelings and the significance of the dessert. Plus, using a food item as a toy wastes it and ignores the creator's intent. So, even if it was a harmless joke, the author's actions had consequences. The answer would likely be A (in the wrong) because they knowingly caused the mishap despite knowing the brother's pride in his creation.\n"
