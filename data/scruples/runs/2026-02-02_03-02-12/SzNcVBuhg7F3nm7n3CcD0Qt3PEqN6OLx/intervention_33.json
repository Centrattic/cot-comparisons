He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made the comment about the cake is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother made a vegan cake, and the author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making the cake for the family brunch. The author admits they've given their brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been more respectful recently. The comment was made impulsively when the daughter asked what the cake was. The author's intention wasn't malicious; it was a joke or a playful comment. However, the result was that the brother's creation was ruined, and he was upset.\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. The author didn't mean to mock the cake maliciously, but the action did cause the brother distress. The brother was proud of his creation, so having it treated as a toy instead of food would be hurtful. Even though the family had fun, the brother's feelings were hurt, and the cake wasn't eaten as intended.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. While the comment was a spontaneous joke, it's important to respect others' efforts and feelings. The brother's dietary choices are personal, and even with a good-hearted comment, the outcome was harmful. The author might have known the brother's dedication to his veganism, so the joke could be seen as dismissive of his efforts. However, the author did feel guilty afterward, suggesting they recognize the impact.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions directly led to the brother's cake being ruined. Even if it was accidental, they should consider the consequences of their words, especially in front of a child. The brother's feelings matter here. While the family enjoyed the arts and crafts, the author's comment was the catalyst for the situation. Therefore, there's a case to be made that the author is partially at fault for not thinking through the implications of their words, even if it was a joke.\n\nOn the flip side, the brother might have presented the cake in a way that was less confusing. But the brother was proud of it, so the expectation was that people would eat it, not play with it. The author's comment, while not malicious, still caused unintended harm. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because their actions, though not with ill intent, still hurt the brother's feelings and undermined his effort.\n"
