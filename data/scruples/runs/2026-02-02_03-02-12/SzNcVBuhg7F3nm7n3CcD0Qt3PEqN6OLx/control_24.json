He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the brother put a lot of effort into making a vegan cake. The author saw it looked like Play-Doh, maybe even smelled like it. Then the daughter asks, and the author jokingly says it's Play-Doh. The whole family ends up using it as craft material instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points are intent and context. The author mentions they've been cool with their brother's veganism lately and respected it. But here, the comment was a joke, maybe a bit of teasing. However, the daughter took it seriously and the family followed suit, causing the brother's dessert to be ruined.\n\nBut was the author's comment a joke? They said \"It's Play-doh, baby!\" which might have been a lighthearted remark. But when the daughter took it literally, the author didn't correct her. Instead, they let the situation escalate. That's a problem. Even if the initial comment was a joke, not stopping the family from using it as Play-Doh led to the brother's dish being wasted. The brother was proud of his creation, so the author's actions, even if unintentional, undermined that effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to disrespect the brother's effort. They were trying to be respectful of his veganism. But the outcome was that the dessert wasn't eaten, which might have been a mistake. The author's guilt suggests they see the issue. Maybe it's a mix of both.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's first statement (calling it Play-Doh) was the catalyst. Even if it was a joke, they didn't correct the family's actions afterward. So, they share some responsibility. The brother's effort was wasted, and the family's action was a result of the author's initial comment. So, the answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
