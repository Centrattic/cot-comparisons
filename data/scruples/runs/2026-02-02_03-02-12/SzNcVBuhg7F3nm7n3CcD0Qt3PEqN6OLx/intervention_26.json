He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for causing their family to treat the brother's vegan cake as Play-Doh. The situation is that the brother made a vegan dessert that looked like Play-Doh, and the parent jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The whole family then ended up using it for arts and crafts instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother was proud of his creation, so the author's comment might have been a joke, but it led to the brother's effort being wasted. The parent claims they've been respecting their brother's veganism lately, but this incident might have undermined that respect.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The parent's intent was probably to make their daughter have fun, but the impact was that the brother felt disrespected. Even if the comment was a joke, the parent took the lead in starting the Play-Doh comment, which then led the rest of the family to follow suit. The brother might have felt his efforts were mocked, even if it was unintentional.\n\nAlso, the parent admits they've made fun of the brother's veganism in the past, which might suggest a pattern of behavior that's not entirely respectful. Even though they've been trying to be more respectful lately, this incident might have broken that trust. The parent had a specific role as the one who made the comment to the child, which then set off the chain reaction.\n\nHowever, the parent might argue that they didn't mean to mock the brother and that it was a harmless mistake. The daughter was young and innocent, so the parent's reaction could be seen as playful. But the problem is that the brother's creation was ruined, and the parent enjoyed the joke, which could be seen as insensitivity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes the impact is more important than the intent. Even if the parent didn't mean to mock, the action still harmed the brother's feelings. The parent should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the dessert. It's about empathy and respect for others' efforts.\n\nSo, even though the parent might not have malicious intent, the action still caused harm. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not considering the brother's perspective and for not taking the dessert seriously when the brother was proud of it.\n"
