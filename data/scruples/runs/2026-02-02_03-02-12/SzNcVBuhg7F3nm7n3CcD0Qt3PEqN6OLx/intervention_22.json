He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family Christmas brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, upon seeing it, told their 4-year-old daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the entire family to use it for arts and crafts instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels a bit guilty.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned that they've given their brother a hard time about his veganism before but have been more respectful lately. In this case, they didn't intentionally mock the brother's choice but made a joke based on how the cake looked. The daughter is four, so her question was innocent, and the author's response was a spontaneous reaction. The family ended up having fun with it, but the brother was not amused.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, intent matters here. The author didn't mean to be malicious; it was a joke that spiraled. However, the brother's effort was disrespected in a way, even if unintentionally. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the dessert. Maybe they should have explained it differently or not made the comment at all. On the other hand, the situation was light-hearted, and the family ended up engaged in a fun activity, even if it wasn't what the brother intended. The author might not be in the wrong because it was a mistake, not a malicious act, but there's a lesson here about being more mindful of others' efforts.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were intentional harm versus a mistake. Since it was a spontaneous, innocent response from a parent to a child's question, it's more of a mistake. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but they might need to apologize to make things right.\n"
