He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh. \n\nFirst, the situation: The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about his veganism, jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The whole family then used it as crafting material instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nSo, the key points are: The author's comment was a joke, but it led to the brother's effort being wasted. The author admits to feeling guilty. Now, considering the brother's pride in his creation, the author's joke might have been at the brother's expense. Even if it was accidental, the author's initial reaction set the tone for the family's response. The brother's veganism was a personal choice, and the author, despite claiming to respect it now, used it as a target for humor. The daughter's innocence is a factor, but the parent still made the initial comment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's history of teasing might have made the brother sensitive, but the situation escalated because of a child's question. The author's intent was likely light-hearted, but the outcome was harmful to the brother's feelings. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort put into the cake. So, while it's not a malicious act, the author's joke had consequences. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they contributed to the brother's embarrassment despite knowing his efforts and dietary choices.\n"
