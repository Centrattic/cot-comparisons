He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which is a personal choice and something he's proud of. The author, despite usually respecting his brother's veganism, made a joke that led to the brother's creation being treated as a toy. This likely hurt the brother's feelings because his work wasn't appreciated as he intended.\n\nThe author mentions they've been giving the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past, even if they've been more respectful lately. This context suggests there might be a pattern of teasing, which isn't healthy in a family setting. The key point here is intent and impact. Even if the author didn't mean to be malicious, the result was that the brother's effort was disrespected, and the family had fun at his expense. \n\nChildren often mimic adults, so the daughter's action was influenced by the author's comment. The whole family joining in on the arts and crafts instead of eating the dessert shows that the author's initial joke had a ripple effect, which the author might not have foreseen but was responsible for starting. \n\nWhile the situation might seem light-hearted, the brother's distress indicates that the author's actions had a negative impact. The author does feel guilty, which suggests they recognize the inappropriateness of their actions, even if they found it funny at the time. \n\nIn family dynamics, respecting each other's efforts and choices is important. The author's action, though perhaps a joke, undermined their brother's effort and could have been hurtful. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
