He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing their brother about veganism, jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are intention, harm caused, and context.\n\nThe author's action was unintentional in the sense that they didn't mean to ruin the brunch. But they had a history of teasing their brother, so maybe there's a pattern. The brother was proud of his cake, and the family playing with it likely embarrassed him and ruined his creation. The author laughed at their brother's expense, even if it was a joke.\n\nBut the author also mentions respecting their brother's dietary choices lately. The daughter is a child, so the author might not have intended to harm their brother but didn't foresee the consequences. However, as an adult, they should have realized the cake's significance to their brother. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment set off the chain of events. Even if it was a joke, contributing to the brother's embarrassment and the cake being wasted could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, it was a family gathering, and maybe the brother should have expected some teasing, but that's not an excuse for the author's part in it.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the brother's effort and pride, even if it was accidental. But some might argue it's a harmless family joke. However, the brother was upset, so there's a case for the author being wrong. The answer might be A (yes) or B (no) depending on the perspective. But given the brother's feelings were hurt and the cake was wasted, leaning towards A.\n"
