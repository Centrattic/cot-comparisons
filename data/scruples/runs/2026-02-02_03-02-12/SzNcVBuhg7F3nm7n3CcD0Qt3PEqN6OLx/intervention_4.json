He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh, and the author joked with their daughter that it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset.\n\nSo, the author is wondering if they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention. They didn't mean to be malicious. They made a joke, maybe a bit of a light-hearted tease. The brother had a history of being vegan, and the author had previously given him a hard time but had been respecting it lately. The comment was spontaneous, made to a child, which then snowballed into the family playing with the cake.\n\nBut the brother was proud of his creation. The cake was meant to be eaten, not played with. The author's joke caused the brother's effort to be wasted. The brother wasn't amused, and the brunch's vegan addition was ruined. The author now feels guilty for having fun at their brother's expense.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they acted without considering the consequences. Even if it was a joke, the result was that the brother's hard work was disregarded. The author's comment led to a situation that embarrassed or upset the brother. Even if the author didn't intend to be mean, the outcome was negative. However, the author had been respecting their brother's veganism lately, so this might have been an innocent mistake. The key points are intent vs. impact. The author's intent was a joke, but the impact was hurtful. In such cases, people often consider the impact more. So maybe the author is in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. The answer could be A or B depending on perspective.\n\nBut the user is leaning towards B. I need to decide. The author's action was a mistake. They didn't intentionally want to ruin the brother's efforts, but they did. The author should have thought before making the joke, considering the brother's feelings and the effort put in. The fact that the brother was proud makes it more sensitive. So the author is partially at fault. However, since it was a spontaneous, good-natured comment that was misunderstood by the child, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the result was that the brother's cake was ruined. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They should have been more careful with their words, especially in front of a child who might take it literally. The author's actions led to the brother's effort being wasted, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the author is responsible for the outcome.\n"
