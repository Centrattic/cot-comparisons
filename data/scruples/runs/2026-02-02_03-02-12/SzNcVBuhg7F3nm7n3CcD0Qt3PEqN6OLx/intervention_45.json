He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author made their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The uncle was proud of his dessert, but the joke backfired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they've been giving their brother a hard time about his veganism before but have been respecting it lately. This time, they made a joke that led to the family not eating the dessert. The brother was upset because his creation was treated as a toy. \n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. Was the author's comment intentional? They said they \"blurted out\" the Play-Doh comment, which might imply it was a spontaneous joke rather than a malicious act. However, even if it was a joke, they should have considered the feelings of their brother, who put effort into making the dessert. \n\nThe daughter is only four, so the comment wasn't meant to be harmful, but the result was that the family didn't eat the dessert, which the brother was proud of. The author feels guilty about having fun at their brother's expense. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at whether there's malicious intent. If the author didn't mean to hurt their brother but the outcome was negative, they might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that they've mocked their brother's veganism before could contribute to a pattern. But the user says they've been respecting it recently, so maybe this was an honest mistake. \n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable\u2014he put effort into the dessert, and it was treated as a toy. The author's actions, even if a joke, prevented the purpose of the dessert. But since it was a Christmas brunch, maybe the family's reaction was more about the humor and less about disrespect. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment was a joke, and they felt guilty afterward. However, there's a case to be made that they should have been more considerate of their brother's feelings. But given the context and lack of malice, the answer leans towards B.\n"
