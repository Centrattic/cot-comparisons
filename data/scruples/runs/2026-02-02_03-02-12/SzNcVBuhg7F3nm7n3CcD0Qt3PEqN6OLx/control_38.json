He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally made their daughter think their brother's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his dessert, but it got ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author didn't mean to directly mock or harm their brother's feelings. They mentioned they've been respectful of his veganism lately. The comment was a spontaneous, maybe innocent reaction to the cake looking like Play-Doh. The daughter is four, so she's young and might take things literally. The author didn't plan for the family to play with the cake, but it happened as a result of the daughter's actions.\n\nHowever, the outcome was that the brother's creation was ruined, and he wasn't amused. The author feels guilty about having fun at their brother's expense. The question is whether this is a case of being in the wrong. The key points are intent and whether there's a real harm. The author didn't intend to be malicious, but their words led to unintended consequences. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on intentions and whether there was a reasonable chance of causing harm. The brother was serving the dessert with pride, expecting it to be eaten. The author's comment, while not malicious, could be seen as dismissive or mocking the effort. Even if unintentional, it's possible the author should have been more careful, given their history of teasing the brother about veganism. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has been trying to be respectful, and the comment was a slip. The daughter's innocent question led to a natural reaction. The family engaging in arts and crafts was more of a humorous accident. The brother's disappointment is valid, but the author might not be fully at fault since it was accidental. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were careless. They might not be in the wrong if they didn't intend to be disrespectful, but there's a case that they should have considered the potential impact of their comment, especially given their past teasing. However, since they corrected their behavior and feel guilty, it might be a minor issue. The majority in AITA threads often lean towards not being in the wrong if there's no malicious intent. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
