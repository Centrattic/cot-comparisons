He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, when their daughter asked what it was, said it was Play-Doh, which led the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset because it ruined his dessert.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They mentioned they've been giving their brother a hard time about veganism before but are now respecting it. So maybe they weren't trying to be malicious here. The comment was made in the moment, when the daughter asked a question. The author might have just been making a joke or a playful remark without thinking about the consequences.\n\nBut on the other hand, the brother put effort into making the cake, expecting it to be eaten. By calling it Play-Doh, the family ended up not eating it and using it for crafts. The brother wasn't amused, which suggests he felt disrespected or that his effort was wasted. The author does feel guilty, so they recognize that there was some wrongdoing or at least insensitivity.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they did make the initial comment that led to the misunderstanding. Even if it was a joke, the result was that the brother's creation was not respected. Families often have inside jokes, but sometimes lines get crossed. The author might have crossed a line by not considering how the brother would feel about his dessert being treated as a toy.\n\nHowever, the daughter was young and innocent, so maybe the author didn't realize the impact. But the author knew the brother was proud of the cake and had a history of teasing him about veganism. So maybe they should have been more careful with their words. The action was not intentional harm, but the outcome was still harmful to the brother's feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions directly caused the family to misinterpret the cake. Even if they thought it was funny, the brother's effort was undermined. The author should have known better, given their history, and perhaps avoided the joke. The family's reaction was playful, but the brother's distress was real. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their brother's effort and for making light of his creation in a way that was hurtful.\n"
