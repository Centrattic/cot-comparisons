He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author made their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his dessert, and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've been giving the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been more respectful lately. This time, the uncle made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, in a moment of humor, told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading to the whole family playing with it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main points here are intent and impact. The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch; it was a joke. But the brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions might have been disrespectful. The author's intent was playful, but the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might argue that even if it was a joke, it disrespected the brother's effort. On the other hand, since it was an accident and the author didn't maliciously intend harm, maybe it's not their fault. Also, the brother's cake looked like Play-Doh, so the confusion might be understandable. However, the author's role in perpetuating that confusion by telling the daughter it was Play-Doh is key. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author's action was a harmless joke or a harmful joke that disrespected the brother's effort. The author felt guilty, which suggests some awareness of the possible wrongness. The brother's reaction was negative, so the impact is there. \n\nIn terms of social norms, making fun of someone's efforts, even in a family setting, can be seen as disrespectful. However, if it was an innocent mistake and not done with malice, maybe it's excusable. The key here is that the author's comment was the catalyst for the family's actions. Even if the cake looked like Play-Doh, the author's intervention led to the whole family playing with it. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's action was a joke that crossed a line or a genuine mistake. The author's history of teasing the brother about veganism could imply that there's an ongoing pattern, which might make this incident more of a continuation of that. However, the author states they've been \"cool with his dietary choices lately,\" suggesting they meant no harm this time. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because their comment led to the family not respecting the brother's creation. Even if it was a joke, the impact was negative. However, since it was accidental and not malicious, some might argue it's not their fault. But in the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the answer would likely be that the author is the asshole because their action directly caused the problem.\n"
