He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-doh. The author's daughter thought it was Play-doh and then the whole family started playing with it instead of eating it. The author feels guilty about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was proud of his creation, and the author made a joke that led the family to treat it as Play-doh. The author admits they've given the brother a hard time about veganism in the past but have been more respectful lately. This time, the joke went too far, even if it was accidental.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. The author's intention might have been a joke, but the result was that the brother's effort was wasted and he was upset. The daughter was young and didn't understand, but the parent still had a role in the situation. \n\nThe author could have clarified that it was a dessert and not Play-doh. Instead, they made a joke that led to everyone playing with it. Even if it was a moment of humor, it might have been at the brother's expense. The author's guilt suggests they see it as a mistake. \n\nConsidering the brother's pride in his creation, the family's reaction ruined his effort. The author's responsibility here is to have respected the brother's effort by not making a joke that led to the cake being treated as a toy. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't prevent the misunderstanding and instead encouraged the family to play with the cake, causing the brother distress.\n"
