Also I'm on the mobile app and apparently that fucks with formatting, so apologies if this post looks a little bit wonky. Sorry if this gets long but y'all are gonna need a bit of backstory for context and I have a real issue with rambling. \n\nI met my now ex-girlfriend at school when we were 14. We were best friends for a year before we began dating and then were together for about six years. I'm 22 now and we've been broken up for a little over six months. I find it easier to tell a story with names so we'll call my ex Jessica. \n\nThe year that we were friends was great. We were both kind of \"emo kids\" and, being that we lived kind of in the middle of nowhere and there weren't any other emos at our school, we kinda naturally drifted towards each other. She was a kind, sweet girl at first - very bubbly, always smiling, always friendly to everybody. She could be a little hyperactive at times, but I'm incredibly laid back and  a bit shy so we kinda  balanced each other's energy perfectly. We'd hang out at each other's houses almost every night after school and play video games, or go walk around the local park if the weather was nicer. I awkwardly asked her out on Valentine's Day of 2012, thinking I was being dead romantic. Still one of the biggest mistakes of my life. \n\nShe started to change pretty soon after we started dating. She'd always been semi-jealous when it came to me, even when we were just friends. Think, if anyone else called me their best friend she'd get on their arse like \"actually sweetie he's *MY* best friend but nice try :)\" or she'd sulk a little if I made plans with other friends and didn't invite her. I'd always found it endearing, I guess because I was never the one getting chewed out. Boy did that change when we started dating! If I so much as spoke to another girl to ask her for the homework for some class, Jessica would get angry with me and demand to know who she was and what we were talking about. I did confront her about it a couple months into the relationship and she cried and told me she was super scared of being cheated on because she'd seen her dad do it to her mum her whole life and said she was sorry. At the time I thought that was reasonable, said alright and tried to move past it. \n\nThe jealousy didn't stop. In fact, it only continued to escalate. When we were 16 she, without my knowing or my consent, went through my Facebook friends and Instagram followers and blocked any girls I wasn't related to. When we were 18 we started renting a flat together and she threatened one of our neighbours to \"keep the fuck away from me\" because she brought over cookies as a welcome gift while Jessica was out. That same year when I came out as bisexual, she told me that she didn't want me hanging out with my best friend since childhood because he was gay and she was afraid of any \"funny business\" going on. It reached a point where she wouldn't even let me go to the hairdresser's because the only one in our town had three women and a gay guy working there and she didn't want any of them touching me. She also repeatedly called my workplace saying I needed to come home because there was an emergency if she knew I was on a shift with all female co-workers (which was often) resulting in me eventually being sacked. \n\nHonestly, if it was just the intense jealousy, I might have been able to cope, or try to salvage some semblance of a relationship with her. But she would also insult me constantly. I'm pretty prone to eczema and she'd make fun of me if I had a breakout of it on my face. She mocked me when I lost my job and she became the breadwinner of the house. She'd either tease me or get incredibly angry with me if I ever cried about anything (I'm a sucker for crying at films). I gained a little weight around 19 when I had an injury and could no longer go to the gym and she called me fat relentlessly (in hindsight, I really wasn't fat at all), which I believe was one of the catalysts to me developing bulimia. All in all it was a shitty, emotionally abusive situation and I should've gotten out of it sooner than I did. \n\nI eventually broke it off because she started to become physically and sexually violent and I was genuinely afraid for my life one night. I'm now staying with my aforementioned childhood best friend and his husband, have a new job, am in recovery for my eating disorder and am well on the way to getting back on my feet. To be clear, I'm not asking if I'm the asshole because of what happened in the relationship because I've come to accept that I was a victim and none of it was my fault. \n\nHowever. A \"friend of Jessica's\" recently reached out to me to let me know that Jess has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and is recieving treatment for it. My response was basically \"ah that sucks for her and I'm glad she's getting treatment but what's that to do with me?\"  What eventually transpired was that I was not speaking to her friend, but in fact Jessica herself through her friend's account, and that I was expected to forgive everything she did because of her diagnosis. I flat out refused because, while I'm no means an expert on personality disorders and do understand that they can make people act irrationally, I don't believe they're an excuse for outright abusive behaviours. Since I refused to forgive her, I've had countless messages from her, from mutual friends, and even from her mother which all essentially boil down to \"she can't help being an abusive person, you're being awful for not forgiving her.\" I'll note here she hasn't actually *apologised*, just incessantly asked me to \"forgive and forget\", \"get over it\" and even to give her a second chance. I'm starting to doubt that I'm doing the right thing by refusing to accept her BPD as an excuse. AITA and should I forgive her? \n\nTL;DR: my ex was incredibly abusive when we were together and has since been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which she's using to try and justify her behaviours without actually apologising. I refuse to accept it as an excuse and she, her mother and our mutual friends are telling me I'm the asshole for not forgiving her. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to accept mental illness as an excuse for their ex's abusive behavior. The situation is that the author describes a six-year relationship with their ex, Jessica, which turned abusive as the relationship progressed. The ex exhibited extreme jealousy, emotional abuse, and eventually physical and sexual violence. The author left the relationship because they were afraid for their life. Now, Jessica has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and is using that diagnosis to justify her actions without offering an apology. The author is being pressured to forgive her, but they refuse to accept the diagnosis as an excuse for the abuse. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what constitutes valid justification for abusive behavior. Mental health issues, like BPD, can contribute to certain behaviors, but they don't excuse actions that are abusive or harmful. BPD can cause issues with emotional regulation, fear of abandonment, and impulsive actions, which might explain some of Jessica's behaviors, such as jealousy and controlling actions. However, even with a mental health diagnosis, individuals are still responsible for their actions and should seek treatment and take accountability for their behavior. \n\nThe key points here are that the author is not being asked to deny Jessica's diagnosis or the challenges she faces. Instead, the author is standing by their decision that abusive behavior is not acceptable, regardless of the underlying cause. The author is also being pressured to forgive without an apology, which complicates things. Forgiveness typically involves the perpetrator acknowledging their wrongdoing, expressing remorse, and making amends. Since Jessica hasn't apologized and is instead using her diagnosis as a justification, the author's refusal to forgive seems reasonable.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of setting boundaries for one's own well-being. The author has left the relationship and is in the process of recovery from an eating disorder caused in part by the abuse. Accepting the abuse as justified could hinder their healing. It's important for victims to not feel blamed or shamed for the abuse they experienced. The author is prioritizing their mental health and safety by not excusing the harmful actions, which is a valid and necessary step in the healing process.\n\nHowever, there's a common misconception that mental illness excuses bad behavior. It's important to clarify that while mental health can influence someone's actions, it doesn't make those actions acceptable. People with mental illnesses still have a responsibility to seek treatment and manage their condition. The fact that Jessica is receiving treatment is positive, but it doesn't retroactively justify the abuse. The author is right to not accept the diagnosis as an excuse, especially since no apology has been given.\n\nLooking at the situation from a victim's perspective, the author is justified in holding the abuser accountable. Abuse is never the victim's fault, and the abuser's actions cannot be excused by their mental health status. The author's stance is about protecting their own well-being and not enabling further harmful behavior from Jessica. The pressure from Jessica's side (including her mother and mutual friends) to forgive without accountability is concerning and may be a form of gaslighting, where they're trying to make the victim feel guilty for not accepting the abuse.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for refusing to accept mental illness as an excuse for abuse. They are prioritizing their healing, setting appropriate boundaries, and holding the abuser accountable. The key here is that the author is not denying the diagnosis but is instead stating that it doesn't justify the harmful actions taken. The correct answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
