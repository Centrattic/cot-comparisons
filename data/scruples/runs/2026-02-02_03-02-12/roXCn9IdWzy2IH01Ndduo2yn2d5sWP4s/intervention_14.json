Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement in an airport between the author and an older lady. The lady is watching a show loudly, and the author uses earbuds, then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts to tell the author to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that she's being loud without headphones. Then the author pretends to agree, but plays a music video loudly, making the lady leave.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about public etiquette and the response to someone's rude behavior. The lady was indeed being disruptive by using loud volume without headphones. The author initially tried to ignore it, which is reasonable. When confronted, the author defended their right to make a call, which is also valid. But then the author escalated the situation by retaliating with loud music after agreeing to be polite. \n\nThe question is whether the author's retaliation is justified. While the lady was wrong, the author's response might be seen as taking it too far. Even if the author felt the lady was rude, playing loud music in response could be considered equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding in kind might not be the best approach. So, even if the author was justified in pointing out the lady's mistake, the act of playing loud music as retaliation could be seen as the author being in the wrong. But some might argue it's just giving her a taste of her own medicine. \n\nHowever, the author's actions do escalate the conflict unnecessarily. The initial response was to point out the lady's behavior, which is reasonable. The retaliation, though, might be crossing a line. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they took it further than necessary. Or B (not wrong) if the intent was to teach a lesson. But in terms of general social conduct, responding with the same level of disruption is not advised. So leaning towards A.\n"
