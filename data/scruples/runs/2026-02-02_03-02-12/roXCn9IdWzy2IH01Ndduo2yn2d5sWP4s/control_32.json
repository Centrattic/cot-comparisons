Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the person is asking if the author of this airport story is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the older lady sits next to the author and starts watching her show loudly. The author tries to be polite by putting in earbuds. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that her behavior is actually rude and that using headphones is common in public. The lady insists she's right, and the author then plays music from his iPad full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nHmm. So the author is being asked if he's in the wrong. Let's consider the rules of public spaces. Generally, people are expected to use headphones when watching videos or shows on electronic devices in public to avoid disturbing others. So the lady was indeed being rude by not using headphones. The author tried to politely point this out. Then, when the lady continues to be rude, the author plays music loudly as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, retaliation is a tricky part. Even if the lady was wrong, the author's response of playing music full volume could be seen as an escalation. The author was trying to mock her behavior by doing the same thing, but that might be considered equally rude. So while the lady was initially at fault, the author's action of playing music loudly could be seen as also being in the wrong because they're both creating a disturbance.\n\nBut there's another angle: sometimes people use humor or a lesson to teach someone, but in a public setting, playing music loudly would still be against the same rules they were trying to enforce. So the author might have crossed the line by responding in kind, even if the initial action was justified. Public spaces have rules for a reason, and disrupting others, even in retaliation, is against those rules. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation by breaking the same rules they were trying to enforce.\n"
