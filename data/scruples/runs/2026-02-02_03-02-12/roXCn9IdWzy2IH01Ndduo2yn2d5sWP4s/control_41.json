Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on a situation at an airport. So the older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts asking him to be quiet. The author responds politely but points out her loudness as rude. Then the lady insists she's right, and the author mockingly complies by playing a music video loudly, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's actions were a justified response or overstepping. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is a common issue in public spaces. The author first tries to address it politely, which is reasonable. However, when the lady refuses to acknowledge her mistake, the author takes it a step further by playing music at loud volume as a form of retaliation. \n\nNow, while the lady was wrong to be loud, the author's response might be seen as escalating the situation. Even if it's a form of tit-for-tat, playing loud music in a public space is also inconsiderate and potentially rude. The author's action turned their conflict into a public spectacle, which could be seen as wrong because it disrupts others as well. So while the lady was the initial wrongdoer, the author's retaliation might not be justified. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding with similar inconsiderate behavior doesn't help. Therefore, the author's action was probably in the wrong, even if it was a humorous or exaggerated response to the lady's behavior.\n"
