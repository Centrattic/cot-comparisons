Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. From the story, the author is at an airport, and an older lady sits next to them and starts watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts and tells them to be quiet. The author responds politely, pointing out that the lady is being rude by not using headphones. Then, the author takes it a step further by playing a music video full volume on their own iPad, which causes the lady to storm off.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. The author claims the lady was being rude, and in response, they mirrored her behavior. The key here is public behavior and etiquette. Generally, using headphones in public places is expected to avoid disturbing others. The lady's actions were indeed inconsiderate, as loud media can be disruptive. The author's initial reaction to put in earbuds is a reasonable response. However, when the lady confronts them, the author corrects her, which is a valid point. \n\nBut then the author takes it further by playing a loud video. This seems like a form of retaliation. Even though the author's argument is correct, their action of playing loud media themselves might cross into being rude, as it's a direct and possibly provocative response. Retaliation in such situations can escalate conflicts and isn't typically considered appropriate. So while the author's initial point is valid, their action of playing loud music could be seen as wrong because it's an aggressive mirror of the lady's behavior. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
