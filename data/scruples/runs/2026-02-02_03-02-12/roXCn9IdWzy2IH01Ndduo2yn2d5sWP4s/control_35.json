Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement at an airport between the author and an older woman.\n\nFirst, the woman sits next to the author, starts watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, the author makes a phone call, which the woman interrupts, asking them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the woman's loud behavior and then, in retaliation, plays a music video full volume on their own iPad, causing the woman to leave angrily.\n\nSo, the key points are: Who started the conflict? The woman was the one being loud first. The author used earbuds to avoid the noise but then made a phone call, which the woman found disruptive. However, the author's phone call is a normal use of a phone, and the woman's loud iPad is the real issue here. The author then retaliates by playing loud music, which is arguably their own rude behavior. \n\nBut the author's initial response was to point out the woman's behavior, which is reasonable. The problem comes when the author decides to mirror the woman's behavior by playing loud music. Even though the author was correcting the woman's actions, the retaliation might be seen as escalating the situation. However, the woman did start it by being disruptive. \n\nIn public spaces, it's generally accepted that people should be respectful and avoid disturbing others. The woman was at fault for not using headphones. The author's phone call is a valid use, but the retaliation by playing loud music is where the author might cross the line. However, the author could argue that they were showing the woman her own behavior by returning the favor. \n\nBut legally and socially, even if the woman was wrong, retaliating in kind might not be the best approach. The author could have continued to ignore her or reported her to airport staff. Instead, they chose to respond in a way that was equally disruptive. So, while the woman was initially wrong, the author's retaliation could make them equally at fault for escalating the conflict. However, the story says the author said \"you're absolutely right\" before retaliating, which might be a sarcastic way of acknowledging the woman's point while actually doing the opposite. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's action of playing loud music is a direct retaliation, which is rude. So, the author might be in the wrong for their own actions, even if the woman started it. But some might argue that the author was teaching a lesson, which is a gray area. However, in public etiquette, both parties have a responsibility to be considerate. The author's retaliation is a form of revenge, which is generally frowned upon. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their response, even if the woman was the initial culprit.\n"
