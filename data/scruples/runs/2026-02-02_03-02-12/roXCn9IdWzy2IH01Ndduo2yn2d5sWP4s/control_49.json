Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady watching a show loudly on her iPad at the airport, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly as well.\n\nFirst, the lady was using her device without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public. The author initially tried to handle it by using earbuds to avoid the noise. When the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely, pointing out the rude behavior. Then, the author takes it a step further by playing a music video loudly as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, considering social norms, it's common to use headphones in public to respect others. The lady's action was inconsiderate. The author's initial response was reasonable, but the retaliation\u2014playing loud music\u2014might be seen as escalating the situation. Even though the author was responding to the lady's behavior, using the same tactics could be viewed as equally rude. The author's actions might be seen as a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Public spaces require mutual respect, and retaliating in kind can lead to conflict. So, while the lady started it, the author's response might still be considered in the wrong because it's an aggressive escalation. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
