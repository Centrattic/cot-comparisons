Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for playing a music video loudly in response to the woman's loud iPad.\n\nFirst, the woman was watching her show loudly, which the author found rude. The author first tried to ignore it by using earbuds and then made a phone call. When the woman interrupted to ask the author to quiet down, the author pointed out the woman's behavior as being louder and rude. The woman insisted she had the right to enjoy her show, so the author then played a loud music video as a response.\n\nNow, the key points here are about public behavior and mutual respect. The woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author had a right to point that out politely. However, when the woman didn't back down, the author retaliated by playing loud music, which is equally inconsiderate. \n\nEven though the woman started it, the author's response escalated the situation. Both parties were being rude, but the author's action was a direct provocation. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While the woman started it, the author's decision to mirror the rude behavior makes them equally at fault in the escalation. So, the answer would be A, because the author chose to respond with equal rudeness instead of diffusing the situation. But wait, maybe the author's action was a form of giving her own behavior back, but in public, that's still inappropriate. So yes, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a public space.\n"
