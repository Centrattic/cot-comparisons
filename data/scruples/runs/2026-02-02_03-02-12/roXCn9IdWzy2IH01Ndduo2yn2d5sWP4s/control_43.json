Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by playing a loud music video on their own device. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public places because it affects others. The author tried to be polite by using earbuds, which is a common way to avoid disturbing others. However, when the woman complained about the phone call, the author's response was to play loud music as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual respect and appropriate behavior in public. The woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author's initial response was reasonable, but when the author decided to retaliate by playing loud music, that crosses a line. Even though the author was responding to the woman's rudeness, using the same method (loud audio) is not the correct approach. Retaliation with similar behavior escalates the situation and can be considered equally rude. The author could have handled it in a different way, like ignoring the complaint or politely explaining the situation again without matching the rude behavior.\n\nSo, while the woman was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music is also inappropriate. Both parties acted inconsiderately, but the question is specifically about the author's actions. The author's retaliation is what's being assessed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they chose to respond with the same disruptive behavior, which is not acceptable regardless of the provocation.\n"
