Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author argues back and then plays a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, the woman was being loud. Public places usually require people to use headphones to keep noise down. So maybe the woman was at fault. The author tried to handle it politely at first by putting in earbuds and then addressing the issue calmly. However, when the woman told the author to quiet down, the author responded by playing a loud video. That seems like a direct retaliation. Even though the woman was being rude, the author's response might be considered equally rude. It's a question of whether the author crossed the line by retaliating in the same manner. Legally, both might have the right to enjoy their devices, but socially, playing loud videos in revenge could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might be A, but I need to think if there's any nuance. Maybe the author had a right to defend their actions but taking it too far by mirroring the behavior makes them wrong. Yeah, probably A.\n"
