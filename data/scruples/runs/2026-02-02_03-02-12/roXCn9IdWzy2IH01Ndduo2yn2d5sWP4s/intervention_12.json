Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe situation is at an airport. An older lady sits next to the author and watches a show on her iPad loud. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then the author makes a phone call using the earbuds. The lady interrupts and asks the author to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out that she's being loud without headphones and that phone calls aren't as rude as watching TV loudly. The lady insists she's right. Then the author takes out their iPad and plays a music video full volume, which makes the lady storm off.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified. The author was annoyed by the lady's loud TV and responded by playing loud music. The question is about who was in the wrong.\n\nPublic spaces do require consideration. It's generally expected that people use headphones for audio devices in public. The lady wasn't doing that, which could be seen as rude. The author tried to politely point this out. But when the lady dismissed the author's concern, the author escalated by playing loud music. \n\nNow, the author's action might be seen as a form of retaliation. Even if the lady was wrong, responding in kind by making noise could be considered equally inconsiderate. While the lady started it, the author's response might not be justified in a public setting where mutual respect is expected. So the author might be at fault for escalating the situation instead of addressing it calmly without reciprocating the noise. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
