Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then the woman interrupts the author's phone call, asking him to be quiet. The author responds politely but points out her loud volume. She insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video loudly, making her storm off.\n\nHmm. So the user thinks the author isn't wrong. But I need to determine if the answer is A or B. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, public spaces like airports have social norms where people are expected to be considerate. The woman was being loud, which is generally considered rude. The author first tried to ignore it, which is reasonable. Then when confronted, the author explains that loud media is the issue. That's fair. But then, in response, the author plays a loud music video. Even though the woman was wrong, retaliating in the same way could be seen as escalating the conflict. \n\nSo the initial actions of the woman were definitely wrong. But the author's response\u2014mocking her by playing loud video\u2014might not be the best approach. While the woman was in the wrong, the author's retaliation could be considered equally rude. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of social conduct, even if someone else is being rude, responding with the same behavior might not be advisable. The author could have continued to ignore the situation or escalated calmly, but choosing to retaliate in kind might be seen as the same kind of inconsiderate behavior. So even though the woman started it, the author's action might still be considered wrong because it's rude to play loud media in public. \n\nBut wait, the author was on a phone call first, which is a common activity in airports. However, the woman's interruption was about that call. Then the author's response was to play loud video. The key point is that the author is using the same behavior the woman was criticized for. So the author is essentially doing the same thing, which is playing loud media, just in response. \n\nIn public, even if someone else is wrong, responding with the same behavior isn't considered acceptable. People are expected to maintain etiquette regardless of others' actions. So while the woman was definitely at fault, the author's retaliation could also be seen as wrong because it's not appropriate to play loud media in public, regardless of the provocation. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the woman was being rude, the author's response was equally inconsiderate and thus also wrong.\n"
