Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the airport watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in return. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The woman is disturbing others with her loud iPad. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then the woman interrupts the author's phone call, asking him to be quiet. The author argues that her behavior is actually rude, which leads to a confrontation.\n\nThe author then plays a music video full volume as a response. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author's initial reaction to point this out politely is reasonable. However, retaliating by playing loud music himself might escalate the situation. While the woman was wrong, the author's response could be seen as equally inconsiderate, even if it's a form of getting back at her. Public spaces require mutual respect, and both sides should aim to be considerate without resorting to revenge tactics.\n\nSo, even though the woman started it, the author's action of playing loud music is also rude. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because responding with the same behavior doesn't solve the issue and makes things worse. The answer should be A.\n"
