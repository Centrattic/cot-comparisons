Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for responding to the loud lady on the plane. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman was watching a show loudly, the author put in earbuds, then made a phone call. The woman interrupted to ask him to be quiet. The author responded by pointing out her loudness and then played a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author initially took a passive approach by using earbuds, which makes sense. But when confronted, he escalated by playing loud on his own device. Now, public spaces usually have unspoken rules about respecting others' space. Using headphones is common to avoid disturbing others. The woman wasn't following that, but the author's retaliation might cross a line.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. Even if the woman was at fault for not using headphones, responding in kind by playing loud music is also rude. It's a tit-for-tat that doesn't resolve the issue and creates conflict. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was asserting his right to call out her behavior and teaching her a lesson. But in public spaces, the expectation is mutual respect. If both parties escalate, it leads to a worse situation. The author's action might be justified as a lesson, but from a social norm perspective, it's still rude to play things loudly in public.\n\nSo, the author's response was a direct retaliation. Even if the initial action (phone call) was less offensive, responding by playing loud video is equally inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he escalated the conflict instead of de-escalating it. He could have continued to ignore her or calmly reiterated his point without retaliating in the same manner.\n"
