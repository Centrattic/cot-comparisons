Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, initially, puts on earbuds and ignores it. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call, asking them to be quiet so she can hear her show.\n\nThe author responds by pointing out that the lady's loud show is actually the rude part and that people use headphones for that reason. The lady claims her right to enjoy her show without interruptions. The author then pretends to apologize and plays a music video loudly on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The initial conflict is about public etiquette. The lady is being loud, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The author's response is to point this out, which seems reasonable. However, when the author plays the music video loudly in retaliation, that's a direct escalation. Even though the author's initial argument had merit, the act of playing loud music as a form of revenge might cross the line. \n\nPublic spaces do require mutual respect. While it's true that the lady was inconsiderate, responding with the same behavior could be seen as inconsiderate as well. The author's action might have been a way to teach a lesson, but it's possible that the author is now mirroring the very behavior they criticized. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's retaliation was a justified form of teaching the lady a lesson or if it's just as wrong as the lady's initial actions. In many cases, public etiquette discussions emphasize mutual respect and de-escalating situations rather than direct confrontation. The author's response might not be the most appropriate, even if they had a point initially. \n\nTherefore, while the lady was definitely at fault for the loud show, the author's loud response could be seen as equally inappropriate. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict rather than finding a calmer solution.\n"
