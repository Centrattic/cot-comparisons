Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, instead of confronting her, initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds politely but points out the woman's behavior. The woman retorts, and the author sarcastically agrees they're wrong, then plays a loud music video on their iPad, which makes the woman storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette and retaliation. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones in a public space. The author first tries to address it politely but is dismissed. When the woman accuses the author of being rude, the author's response is sarcastic and then escalates the situation by playing loud music, which provokes the woman to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the woman started by being disruptive. On the other, the author's response was a tit-for-tat retaliation. Even though the author was in the right to point out the woman's rudeness, the act of playing loud music in response was also a breach of public etiquette. The author's actions, while perhaps humorous, were an intentional provocation. So, even if the initial action was justified, the escalation could be seen as wrong because it mirrored the woman's inconsiderate behavior. The author didn't handle it maturely; instead of resolving the issue, they took revenge, which isn't the best approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they responded in a way that's equally rude, even if it was a form of payback.\n"
