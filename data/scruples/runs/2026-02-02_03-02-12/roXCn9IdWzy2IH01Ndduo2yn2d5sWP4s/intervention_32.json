Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a woman watching her iPad loudly at the airport. The author first tried to ignore it and put in their earbuds. Then, when the woman complained about the phone call, the author explained that her behavior was the issue. Finally, the author played a music video at full volume, causing the woman to leave.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the woman was being loud, the author tried to handle it politely by using earbuds and explaining the situation. But then the author escalated by playing their own loud video. Now, the question is whether that makes the author at fault. \n\nIn public spaces, there's an expectation to be considerate. The woman's initial action was inconsiderate because she was using a device without headphones. However, the author's response of playing loud video is also inconsiderate. Even if it's a form of revenge or making a point, it's still disruptive to others. The author could have chosen to ignore it again or talked to the woman privately. By playing loud, they caused a disturbance too. \n\nSo, even though the woman was wrong first, the author's actions also broke the norm of being considerate in public. That means both acted inconsiderately, but the author's retaliation made them equally at fault. The user might think the author was justified, but from a general etiquette standpoint, causing a scene in public is usually frowned upon, regardless of the reason.\n"
