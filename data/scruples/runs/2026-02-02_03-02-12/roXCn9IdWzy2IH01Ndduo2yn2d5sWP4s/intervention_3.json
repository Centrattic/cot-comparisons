Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being told to quiet their phone call.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The lady is being disruptive by watching her show at a loud volume. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask for quiet. The author responds politely but points out the lady's behavior is rude. Then the author sarcastically says they're wrong, and plays a music video loudly, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider social norms and public conduct. In public spaces, people are expected to be considerate. Playing media loudly without headphones is generally frowned upon. The lady's action is disruptive, so the author's initial reaction is understandable. However, the author's response of playing a loud music video after the confrontation might be the issue. Even if the lady was wrong, retaliating in kind could escalate the situation and isn't considered appropriate conflict resolution. The author's sarcastic agreement and then taking a similar action could be seen as a \"taste of their own medicine\" approach, which might not be the best way to handle it. While the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response could be viewed as equally rude, even if it's a form of punishment. So, there's a balance here. Legally, maybe neither is wrong, but socially, both acted inconsiderately. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author escalated the conflict by using the same method as the lady, they might be at fault for their own actions. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, some might argue that the author was just showing the lady the consequences, hence not wrong. But generally, responding in kind isn't the right approach. So probably answer A.\n"
