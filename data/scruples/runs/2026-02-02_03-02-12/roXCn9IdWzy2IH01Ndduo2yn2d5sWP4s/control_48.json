Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong in this airport situation. The story is from an \"Am I the Asshole\" post, so it's probably looking for some judgment.\n\nFirst, the setup: an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly in the airport. The author had earbuds in but was on a call. The lady interrupts to tell the author to talk quietly, since her show is too hard to hear. The author responds by pointing out that she's using no headphones, which is the actual issue. Then, the author takes the earbuds out, takes out an iPad, and plays a music video at full volume, causing the lady to leave angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The lady used her device without headphones, which the author rightly points out is rude in public. The lady then tells the author to stop his call, which the author argues is less rude. The author then retaliates by playing loud music. \n\nSo, the key points here: the lady was the initial one being disruptive. The author tried to confront her politely but then escalated by playing loud music. Even though the lady started it, the author's response was to do the same, but in a way that's clearly intended to annoy. \n\nThe author's action of playing the music video full volume is a direct retaliation, which is an intentional disruption. Even if the lady was wrong, the author's response is also rude and goes beyond a polite confrontation. So, while the lady was initially at fault, the author's action in retaliating with their own loud behavior is also wrong. \n\nIn terms of social norms, responding to rude behavior with similarly rude behavior isn't considered acceptable. The author could have chosen to ignore or maybe report the situation, but retaliating in kind is not the right approach. So the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation with intentional disruption, even if the other person was being inconsiderate first.\n"
