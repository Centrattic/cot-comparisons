Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong in the airport scenario. The situation is that an older woman was watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author responded by playing a music video full volume after being scolded. So, the question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The woman sits next to the author and watches a show loudly. The author puts on earbuds to avoid the noise. Then, the author makes a phone call, which the woman interrupts, asking to speak quietly. The author responds by pointing out her loud behavior and then plays a music video full volume, leading the woman to leave in anger.\n\nNow, evaluating who's at fault. Public spaces often have rules about not disturbing others. The woman was definitely being loud, which is inconsiderate. The author tried to ignore it at first but was interrupted during a call. The author's response was to play loud music in return. \n\nSo, the key points here are mutual inconsideration. While the woman started by being loud, the author's retaliation by playing loud music full circle might be seen as equally inconsiderate. The author could have chosen a different approach, like asking the woman to lower her volume politely or moving seats if possible. Instead, the author matched her behavior, which escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if provoked, retaliating in the same manner isn't considered appropriate. It's about maintaining composure and resolving conflicts without escalation. The author's action was a direct response to the woman's provocation, but it's still inconsiderate to others around them. The woman was wrong first, but the author's response was also wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because while the initial provocation was the woman's fault, the author's retaliation was inappropriate and equally disruptive. Both parties made mistakes, but the question is specifically about the author. Therefore, the author's action is inconsiderate and escalates the conflict, making them at fault.\n"
