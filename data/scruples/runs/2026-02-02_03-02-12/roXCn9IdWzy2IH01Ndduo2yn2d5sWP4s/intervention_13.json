Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about an airport incident where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author responds by also playing something loudly after being told to be quiet during a phone call.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public places because others can hear it. The author tried to ignore it by using earbuds but then had a phone call. The woman interrupted the call, asking him to be quiet. He responded politely, pointing out that her own behavior was rude. Then he decided to play a music video loudly on his iPad, which made her leave in anger.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a form of retaliation. The question is whether this was justified. On one hand, the woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones. On the other hand, the author escalated the situation by playing loud music in response. Even though he was pointing out her mistake, his actions of playing loud video might be seen as equally rude, turning the situation into a cycle of mutual disrespect.\n\nPublic spaces require mutual consideration. While the woman was at fault for the initial loud behavior, the author's response could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, he mirrored her behavior, which might not be the best approach. However, some might argue that he was just showing her the consequence of her actions.\n\nBut legally and socially, both parties have a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. The author's action of playing loud music after being asked to stop his phone call might be seen as equally rude, even if it was in response to her. So, while the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's reaction could also be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he escalated the conflict instead of resolving it politely.\n"
