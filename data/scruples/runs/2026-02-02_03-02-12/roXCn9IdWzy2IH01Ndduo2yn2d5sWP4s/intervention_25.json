Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about two people in an airport with a conflict over volume levels. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the setup: an older lady sits next to the author and watches her iPad loudly. The author puts on earbuds and ignores it. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts and tells him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that she's being loud and that using headphones is the norm. Then the author gives a sarcastic reply, agreeing with her but then plays a music video full volume, causing the lady to get angry and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points here are about public behavior and respect. The lady was indeed being loud, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author's initial response was to tell her that her behavior was rude, which could be justified. However, when the author then plays loud music in retaliation, that's a problem. Even if the lady was wrong, the author's response of playing loud music is also a violation of the same rule. So, the author's action is equally rude and escalates the situation. While the lady started the conflict, the author's reaction isn't justified by the situation. Public spaces require mutual respect, and retaliating in the same manner doesn't solve the issue. So, the author is in the wrong for responding with their own loud behavior, even if the lady was initially at fault. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
