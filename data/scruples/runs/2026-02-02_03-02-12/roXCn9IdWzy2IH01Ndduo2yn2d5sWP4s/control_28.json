Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the airport story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman watching a show loudly on her iPad and the author, who initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then the author makes a phone call, and the woman interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loudness and then retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong in his actions. First, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The woman was using her device at a loud volume in a public space. The author tried to handle it politely by using earbuds and then when confronted, he defended his actions and then escalated by playing something loudly in response.\n\nPublic spaces like airports usually have rules about keeping noise levels down, especially without headphones. The woman's behavior of watching a show loudly could be considered rude. However, the author's response of making a loud phone call initially might not be the best approach. But when the woman criticized him, he pointed out her actions, which could be seen as mutual. However, then he took it further by playing the music video at full volume, which is similar to her actions but as a retaliation. This could be seen as overstepping because even though she started it, responding in kind isn't necessarily the right approach. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's generally better to address issues calmly and without escalation. The author's retaliation might be seen as a tit-for-tat response, which can be childish and counterproductive. Even if the woman was in the wrong, the author's method of giving her a taste of her own behavior (by playing loud music) could be considered inappropriate. The key point is whether the author's actions were justified. While the woman was rude first, the author's response might have been a reasonable reaction to point out the hypocrisy, but then taking it further by playing loud media could be seen as wrong because he was also violating the same rule he was criticizing her for. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because while the woman started it, his retaliation escalated the situation unnecessarily. Even if he was pointing out the hypocrisy, playing loud music after the argument might not be the correct approach. However, if the author was just mirroring her behavior to make a point, maybe it's a matter of perspective. But in terms of right and wrong, actions that escalate conflict are usually not advisable. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation with a similar rude behavior.\n"
