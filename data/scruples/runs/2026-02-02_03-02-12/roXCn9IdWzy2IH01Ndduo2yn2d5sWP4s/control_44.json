Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict at an airport. The author was sitting next to a woman who was watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignored it and used earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman complained. The author responded by pointing out her loud volume and then, in a sarcastic way, played a loud music video on their own device, causing the woman to leave angrily.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let's break it down. Public spaces often have norms about noise. Generally, using headphones is expected to avoid disturbing others. The woman was indeed being loud, which is rude. The author tried to address it politely, which is good. However, the author's retaliation by playing loud music themselves seems to be a form of revenge or giving her a taste of her own medicine. While the initial behavior of the woman was inconsiderate, the author's response could be seen as escalating the situation. Even if the author was right about the woman's behavior, playing loud music in response might not be the appropriate way to handle it. It could be considered equally rude because it disrupts others. The author's sarcastic agreement and then the action of playing loud music might be crossing a line, even if they were provoked. So, while the woman was wrong initially, the author's retaliation might not be justified, making them in the wrong in the eyes of some. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because their response was an escalation that caused further disruption.\n"
