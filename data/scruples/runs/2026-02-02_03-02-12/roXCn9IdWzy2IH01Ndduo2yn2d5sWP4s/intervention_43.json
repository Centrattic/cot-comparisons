Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is at the airport, and an older lady sits next to them. She starts watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call using the earbuds, the lady interrupts and tells them to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out that her volume is too loud and that using headphones is standard. The lady claims her right to enjoy her show, and the author sarcastically agrees they're wrong, then plays a music video loudly on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. Public spaces often have unspoken rules about noise levels. The lady was being loud, which is generally frowned upon. The author tried to address it politely, but when the lady was confrontational, the author escalated the situation by retaliating with their own loud device. \n\nWhile the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music in return is a form of tit-for-tat. This kind of retaliation can be seen as inappropriate because it escalates the conflict and doesn't resolve the issue constructively. Even if the author's actions were a reaction to the lady's behavior, choosing to mirror her loudness might be considered equally rude. The author's actions could be seen as provocative, leading to the lady's anger and departure. So, while the lady started the problem, the author's response might be seen as equally at fault for not de-escalating the situation and instead matching her behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding with similar rude behavior."
