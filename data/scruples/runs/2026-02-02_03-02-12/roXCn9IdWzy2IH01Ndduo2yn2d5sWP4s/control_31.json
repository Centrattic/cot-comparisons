Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this scenario. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author is using earbuds and makes a phone call. The lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely but then points out she's being rude by not using headphones. Then he plays a music video full volume himself, causing her to leave angry.\n\nFirst, the lady was indeed being inconsiderate by watching without headphones, as public spaces usually require consideration for others. The author initially tried to ignore it and used earbuds. When she interrupted his call, he responded politely. However, when he retorts about her being rude, he then escalates the situation by playing loud music. \n\nThe key point here is the author's response after the confrontation. Even though the lady was wrong, the author's retaliation by playing loud music might be seen as equally rude. While the initial action of pointing out her mistake could be justified, taking it further by doing the same thing could make him at fault. Both actions are inconsiderate, but the author's actions were a direct response, which might be seen as provoking or matching the inconsiderate behavior. So, even if the lady started it, the author's choice to retaliate in kind could place him in the wrong, as it's about mutual respect and not giving into the same rude behavior. The question is whether the author's actions were justified as a form of giving her a taste of her own behavior. In public spaces, both parties should adhere to being considerate. The author's decision to play loud music after the argument could be seen as the wrong move because it escalates the conflict instead of resolving it. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for retaliating in the same manner.\n"
