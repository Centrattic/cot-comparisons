Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad without headphones, and the author is on a call with earbuds. The woman tells the author to be quiet, and the author responds by saying she's wrong and then plays a music video loudly on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman didn't use headphones, which could be seen as inconsiderate in a public space. The author tried to politely point this out when the woman interrupted their call. The author's response was to play a video loudly as a form of retaliation. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's retaliation crosses the line. Public spaces do expect some consideration for others. While the woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones, the author's response of playing a video at full volume is also inconsiderate. It's a form of passive-aggressive retaliation that escalates the situation. Even though the author was trying to make a point about mutual respect, their action might be seen as equally rude. \n\nThe author's initial argument about the woman's behavior being rude is valid, but responding in kind by making noise themselves could be viewed as the wrong approach. The appropriate response might have been to continue politely asking her to use headphones without reciprocating the noise. The author's action, while humorous or cathartic, might not be the socially accepted way to handle the situation. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally inconsiderate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for their response, even if the initial issue was valid. Answer A (Yes) or B (No) depends on whether the retaliation is considered wrong. Since the author's action was a direct response to the woman's inconsiderate behavior but in a way that mirrors the problem, the judgment might be split. However, typically, retaliating in a public setting isn't advised. So, the answer is A.\n"
