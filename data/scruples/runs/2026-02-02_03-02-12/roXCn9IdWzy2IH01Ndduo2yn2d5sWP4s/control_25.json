Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict at an airport between two people regarding volume levels.\n\nFirst, the older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores her and uses earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by pointing out the lady's loud volume as rude. The lady insists she has the right to enjoy her show. The author then sarcastically complies by playing a music video at full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the key actions here are the author's response. The lady was indeed inconsiderate by using her device without headphones in a public space. The author first tries to politely point this out. But then, when the lady doubles down, the author retaliates by playing a loud video in response. This seems like an escalation. While the lady was in the wrong initially, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally rude, even if it's a form of \"teaching a lesson.\" \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Public spaces do require consideration, but the author's response of playing loud music as a form of \"taste of her own medicine\" could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author was correcting the lady's behavior, using the same inconsiderate action might not be the right approach. So, while the lady was the first to be rude, the author's retaliation could also be considered wrong because it's not resolving the conflict but escalating it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding with equal inconsideration.\n"
