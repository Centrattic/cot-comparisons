Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman interrupts him to ask him to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out that she's being rude by not using headphones, and then plays a music video loud to \"get back\" at her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady was indeed being inconsiderate by playing her show loudly in a public space. Public places usually require using headphones to avoid disturbing others. The author's initial response was to ignore it, which is reasonable. When she interrupted his phone call, he politely pointed out her behavior. That part seems fair because she was the one causing the disturbance.\n\nBut then, the author decides to retaliate by playing a music video at full volume. This is where the issue lies. Even though the lady was wrong, the author's response of playing loud videos is also inconsiderate. It's a form of payback that creates the same problem he was initially upset about. So while the lady was definitely at fault first, the author's retaliation makes him equally culpable. \n\nThe key here is that responding to rudeness with more rudeness doesn't resolve the issue and can escalate it. The author could have handled it differently, like asking the airport staff or using a more peaceful method. Instead, he chose to mirror her behavior, which justifies why she got so angry. So even though he had a point about her behavior, his actions were not appropriate. Therefore, he is in the wrong for retaliating in the same manner.\n"
