Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both parties' actions. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The author initially tried to handle it by putting on earbuds. Then, when the woman complained about the phone call, the author pointed out the inconsistency. The key moment is when the author decided to retaliate by playing the music video loudly, which led to the woman getting angry.\n\nLegally, in public spaces like airports, there are usually rules about using headphones to prevent disturbing others. The woman's behavior was against that norm. However, the author's response of playing loud music is also a violation of the same norm. While the author might have felt justified in pointing out the hypocrisy, retaliating in the same way could be seen as equally rude. So, even though the woman started it, the author's action was also against social etiquette. The question is whether the author's retaliation makes them in the wrong. Since both actions are violations, the author's response might be considered inappropriate, even if it was a form of payback. So the answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the ethical aspect here is about mutual wrongdoing. So the answer is A.\n"
