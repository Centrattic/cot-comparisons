Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong in the airport situation. The scenario is that an older woman was watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author, after trying to be polite, retaliated by playing a music video loudly on their own device when the woman complained.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the initial actions. The woman was using a public space without headphones, which is generally considered rude. The author tried to handle it by ignoring her and using earbuds. When the woman interrupted the author's phone call, the author confronted her politely. The key moment is when the author, after agreeing the woman was right, then played loud music to \"get back\" at her.\n\nNow, the question is whether this retaliation was wrong. Even though the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's response might be considered an overreaction. Public spaces have social norms about noise, but responding with the same behavior doesn't set a good example and can escalate the situation unnecessarily. The author's action, while a form of \"tough love,\" might be seen as equally rude, even if it was a reaction to the woman's behavior. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially, it's about mutual respect. The author's choice to play loud music could be seen as inappropriate, even if it's a way to show the woman her own actions were wrong. So, while the author may feel justified, the act of retaliating in kind might place them in the wrong from a social etiquette standpoint.\n"
