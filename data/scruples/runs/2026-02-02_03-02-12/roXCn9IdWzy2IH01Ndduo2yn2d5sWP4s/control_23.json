Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, who's sitting next to her, initially ignores the noise but puts in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the woman interrupts to ask him to quiet down. The author responds by pointing out that her loud volume is actually rude and that phone calls aren't as disruptive. The woman insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume on his iPad, leading her to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual rudeness and escalation. The woman's behavior of watching a show at high volume in a public space is indeed inconsiderate. Public places often have rules about keeping media volume low, especially in quiet zones like airports. The author's initial reaction is to use earbuds and make a phone call, which are reasonable. However, when she interrupts, the author's response is to argue and then escalate by playing loud music himself. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Both parties acted inconsiderately. The woman broke the norm by not using headphones, and the author retaliated by doing the same. But in a public setting, the expectation is to be considerate of others' space and noise levels. The author's retaliation might be seen as equally rude, even if it's a form of poetic justice. However, the woman's initial action started the problem. \n\nBut legally and socially, the author might have overstepped by responding with his own loud behavior. It's not uncommon for people to feel justified in retaliating, but in a public space, mutual escalation doesn't help. The author could have addressed the issue politely without mirroring the rude behavior. So while the woman was in the wrong first, the author's response was also inconsiderate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since both acted rudely, but the author's action was a direct retaliation, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in terms of social norms, the author's action is likely seen as equally wrong because they chose to retaliate instead of maintaining composure. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the situation.\n"
