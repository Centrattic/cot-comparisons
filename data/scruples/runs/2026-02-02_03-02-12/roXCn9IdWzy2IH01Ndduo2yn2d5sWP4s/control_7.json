Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after retaliating against a woman who was watching TV loudly on her iPad in an airport.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is being inconsiderate by using her device without headphones, making her show audible to others. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the woman confronts the author for making a phone call (which is a common activity on public transport), the author points out the woman's rude behavior but in a polite way. However, instead of escalating further, the author sarcastically agrees with the woman's point, then retaliates by playing a music video loudly on their own device, causing the woman to leave in anger.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are about public etiquette and proportionality in responding to someone else's inconsiderate behavior. While the woman was clearly wrong for using her device without headphones, the author's response of playing loud music is also inconsiderate. Public spaces require mutual respect, and both parties have a responsibility to minimize disturbance. The author's retaliation, though perhaps a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" escalates the situation rather than resolving it. It's a form of passive-aggressive retaliation that doesn't address the issue but instead mirrors the inconsiderate behavior. Therefore, even though the woman started it, the author's response is equally inconsiderate, making them also at fault. So the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
