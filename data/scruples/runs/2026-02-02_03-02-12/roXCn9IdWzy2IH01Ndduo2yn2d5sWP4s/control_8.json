Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an airport. An older lady sits next to the author and watches a show on her iPad without headphones, making a lot of noise. The author initially ignores it and puts on earbuds. Then the author makes a phone call, and the lady gets upset and asks him to talk quieter so she can hear her show. The author responds by pointing out that her loud show is actually the rude behavior in public, and that people use headphones for that. The lady insists she's right and the author is wrong. Then the author plays a music video full volume on their own device, and the lady storms off.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. Both parties are engaging in behaviors that could be considered inconsiderate. The lady is watching a show without headphones, which is disruptive because others can hear it. The author is making a phone call, which is also something that should be done quietly in public. However, the author's response to the lady's complaint is to play loud music in return. \n\nThe author's actions after the lady's complaint seem to be a form of retaliation. Even though the author might have a valid point about the lady's behavior, responding by playing loud music isn't appropriate. The author could have escalated the situation by matching her inconsiderate behavior. The lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, but the author's actions were also inappropriate because they were a direct act of revenge. \n\nSo, while the lady started the initial issue, the author's decision to retaliate by playing loud music is where they cross into being in the wrong. Public spaces require mutual respect, and even if someone is rude, responding with the same level of inconsideration isn't the solution. The author's actions would likely be seen as equally rude, if not worse, because it's a direct and intentional provocation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their response.\n"
