Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the narrator responds by playing loud music after being told to quiet down. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence of events. The woman sits next to the narrator and plays her show loudly. The narrator tries to ignore it by using earbuds. Then when the narrator makes a phone call, the woman interrupts and tells them to be quiet. The narrator responds by telling her that her behavior is actually rude and points out that people use headphones for such situations. The woman gets defensive, and the narrator then plays a music video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the rules of public conduct. Generally, in public places like airports, it's expected that people use headphones to avoid disturbing others. So, the woman's actions of playing her show loudly might be the initial issue. However, the narrator's response is to escalate the situation by playing loud music after the woman's complaint. \n\nThe key here is the principle of reciprocity. The narrator criticized the woman for being loud and then, in turn, does the same. Even though the narrator was initially right to point out the woman's wrongdoing, their retaliation by playing loud music could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, so retaliating in kind undermines that. The narrator's action might be seen as disproportionate, especially since after the initial confrontation, the woman was already defensive. The narrator could have instead adjusted their own behavior, like moving seats or using their earbuds, instead of responding with the same disruptive action. \n\nAlso, the narrator's response of \"I am completely wrong\" might have been sarcastic, which could have escalated the tension. Then, playing music loudly after that was a direct reaction that crossed the line. So even if the woman started it, the narrator's action is equally problematic because they chose to retaliate in a public setting, which isn't considered respectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for responding with the same behavior they criticized.\n"
