Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching TV on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it, puts in earbuds, and then when making a phone call, the woman interrupts and asks them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the woman's loudness and then plays a music video loudly on their own iPad, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman is using a device in a public space without headphones, which is generally considered inconsiderate because others might find it disruptive. The author, instead of confronting her directly or reporting the issue, chooses to retaliate by playing their own media loudly. \n\nThe key points here are about public etiquette and the appropriate response to someone else's inconsiderate behavior. The woman's initial action is rude because public spaces require consideration for others, hence the need for headphones. The author's response, while perhaps justified in pointing out the woman's behavior, escalates the situation by playing loud media in return. This retaliation could be seen as equally rude, even if it's a form of \"getting back\" at her. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions make them wrong. While the woman was in the wrong first, the author's choice to respond with the same level of inconsideration might not be the best approach. However, the author could argue that they were simply returning the favor for the woman's initial rudeness. \n\nBut in terms of societal norms and expected behavior, even if someone else is being rude, retaliating in kind is generally not considered acceptable. The appropriate response would be to address the issue politely, perhaps asking the woman to lower the volume or informing an airport staff member. The author's decision to play loud video as a form of getting back isn't constructive and could be seen as equally inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, while the woman was clearly wrong first, the author's action of playing loud media might be seen as wrong because it's not a constructive solution and escalates the conflict. However, some might argue that the author was just giving her own rude behavior back, which mirrors her actions. But typically, even if someone else is rude, responding with the same behavior isn't considered the right thing to do. So the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing nuances. The initial action of the woman is definitely wrong. The author's response, while a form of retaliation, is also rude. So the author's action is wrong because they chose to respond in a similarly inconsiderate way instead of addressing it calmly. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
