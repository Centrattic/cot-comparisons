Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the airport who's watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The lady was being inconsiderate by using her iPad loudly. The author tried to be polite, used earbuds, and even had a conversation where they pointed out the lady's rudeness. Then the author retaliated by playing a loud music video. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing so.\n\nPublic spaces do require consideration for others. The lady clearly violated that by not using headphones. The author's initial reaction was to point this out politely, which seems reasonable. But then, the escalation: the author took the same action the lady did, just with a different content. Retaliation might not be the best approach. Even if the lady was being rude, the author's response could be seen as equally rude. But the user's side is that the author was justified in giving her own behavior a taste, so to speak.\n\nLegally, maybe both are within their rights to use devices as long as they don't disturb others. But socially, the expectation is to use headphones. The author's action, while tit-for-tat, might be seen as a justified response in some views, but others might see it as equally inconsiderate. However, the key here is that the author had already addressed the issue politely. The lady didn't back down, so the author's escalation might be seen as a way to make her realize her own behavior. But is that acceptable?\n\nIn many cases, escalating a conflict can be problematic. However, the author's action was a direct response to the lady's behavior. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or situational norms. If the author's action was a form of pointing out the hypocrisy, some might support it, others might not. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's initial complaint was valid. The retaliation could be seen as a form of teaching a lesson, which is debatable. However, since the author had already made their point and the lady continued, the response might be a justified form of showing her the same treatment. Therefore, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
