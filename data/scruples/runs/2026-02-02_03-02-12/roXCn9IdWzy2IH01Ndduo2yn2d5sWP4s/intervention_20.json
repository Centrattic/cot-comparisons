Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an older lady playing her show loudly in the airport, and the author responding by playing a music video full volume after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The lady was using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author initially tolerated this by using earbuds, but when the lady interrupted the author's phone call, there was a confrontation. The author then played a loud video in response, leading the lady to leave angrily.\n\nThe key points here are about public etiquette and proportional response. The lady's action of not using headphones is a common issue in public places. The author's phone call, while using earbuds, was perhaps a minor disruption, but the lady's interruption was confrontational. The author's response of playing loud video seems to be a form of retaliation. \n\nLegally, in most public spaces, there are rules about noise levels, but enforcement might not be immediate. Ethically, the author's action of playing loud video after the confrontation might be seen as escalating the situation. While the lady was indeed being rude, the author's retaliation could also be considered rude. However, the initial provocation was the lady's loud behavior. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author's response, while perhaps justified in their view, might overstep. Public spaces require mutual respect, and retaliating with noise could be seen as equally rude. However, given that the lady was already violating norms, the author's action could be a way to make a point. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties contributed to the conflict. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether retaliation was appropriate. Since the author was initially a victim of the loud behavior, their response might be seen as a form of protest. However, playing loud video could be considered equally disruptive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If we strictly follow the idea that retaliation is not the solution, then the author might be at fault. But if considering the context of the lady's initial rudeness, the author's action could be a justified reaction. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. However, in most public etiquette guidelines, both loud phone calls and loud media without headphones are discouraged. The author's retaliation, while understandable, might not be the right approach. So leaning towards answer A (author is in the wrong) because retaliation is not the best solution, even if the initial action was rude. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
