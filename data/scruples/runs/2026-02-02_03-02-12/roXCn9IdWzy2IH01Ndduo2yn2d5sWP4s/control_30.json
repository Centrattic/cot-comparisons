Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it but then uses earbuds to make a phone call. The lady interrupts the call, asking him to be quiet. The author responds by telling her she's being rude and then plays a loud music video, leading her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are public etiquette and mutual respect. Public spaces like airports usually have unspoken rules about noise levels. Using headphones is common to avoid disturbing others. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which the author pointed out. However, the author's response of playing a loud music video in retaliation might be the issue here.\n\nThe initial conflict arises from both parties not respecting each other's space. The author had the right to ask the lady to lower her volume, but escalating the situation by playing loud music could be seen as a poor response. Retaliation in public can be inappropriate and might escalate tensions. Even if the author felt wronged, playing a music video loudly could be considered equally rude. The lady might have a valid point about using headphones, but the author's reaction might not be the best way to address it. The author's actions, while perhaps a form of poetic justice, could be seen as inconsiderate and unprofessional. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it.\n"
