Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady watching a show on her iPad at the airport without headphones, which the author finds rude. The author then makes a phone call, which is interrupted by the lady asking him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her lack of headphones as the real issue, then complies by taking off his earbuds. Later, the author plays a loud video on their iPad in full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, both parties are in a public space where noise levels can be a mutual issue. The lady is using her device loudly, which is generally considered impolite in public because it affects others. The author, when asked to lower his phone call, responds by pointing out her behavior. While the author is correct that loud device use is rude, the way they respond might be an issue. However, the author then complies with the request by removing their earbuds, which is a reasonable response.\n\nThe key point is the author's retaliation by playing a loud music video. Even though the lady was being disruptive, the author's action mirrors her behavior, escalating the situation. Playing a video at full volume in retaliation is not a proportionate or polite response. It's a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" but it's still disruptive and unkind. The author's actions, while perhaps justified in their mind as a lesson, are equally rude and could be seen as the last straw that caused the lady to leave in anger.\n\nSo, while both parties have some responsibility, the author's final action of playing loud music is the direct cause of the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a similar manner.\n"
