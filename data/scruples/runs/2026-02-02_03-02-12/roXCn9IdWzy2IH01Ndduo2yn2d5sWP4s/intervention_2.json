Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by responding to the loud woman with a similar action. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman was watching a show loudly. The author tried to ignore it by using earbuds but then had a phone call. The woman complained, and the author pointed out the hypocrisy of her being upset about a phone call while she was using loud electronics. Then the author played a music video loudly, leading the woman to storm off.\n\nNow, the key points. The woman was using a device without headphones, which is indeed impolite in public. The author's initial response was to point out the hypocrisy, which is reasonable. But then the author escalated by playing loud music. The question is whether this retaliation makes the author wrong.\n\nLegally, maybe both are at fault for using loud devices. But socially, there's an expectation to use headphones in public. The author's action was a direct retaliation, which might be seen as an eye-for-an-eye approach. But was it justified? Some might argue it's fair to show the consequence of her behavior. Others might say it's not the right way to handle it, even if the woman was wrong. Retaliation can lead to escalation.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author's action was a form of giving a taste of her own medicine. But does that make the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the author's goal was to teach a lesson, it worked, but the method could be considered inappropriate. Alternatively, if the author was just mirroring the woman's behavior to highlight its rudeness, it's a form of social commentary, but still a confrontational one.\n\nIn public spaces, the norm is mutual respect. The author's retaliation, while showing the woman's hypocrisy, might not be the best response. However, the author was also within their rights to use their device, just as the woman was. The difference is that the author did it intentionally to provoke a reaction. That intent might tip the balance in terms of being seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author was responding to the woman's actions, but the method of response could be seen as wrong because it was an active provocation rather than a passive correction. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes, in the wrong) because of the retaliatory nature, even though the initial complaint was valid.\n"
