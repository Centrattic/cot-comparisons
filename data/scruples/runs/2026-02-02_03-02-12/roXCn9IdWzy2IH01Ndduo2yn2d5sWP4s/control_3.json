Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an airport, an older lady is watching a show loudly, the author puts on earbuds. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call, asking to talk quietly. The author responds that the lady's behavior is rude and then plays a music video full volume to get back at her. The lady storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The lady was using a device at a loud volume in public. That's pretty common, but generally, public spaces do expect people to use headphones or keep the volume low. So her behavior was indeed rude.\n\nThe author initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then when the lady interrupted the call, the author confronted her politely, pointing out the lady's rudeness. But then the author escalated by playing the music video full volume, which caused the lady to storm off. \n\nThe key here is the author's retaliation. While the lady was wrong, the author's response of playing loud music in return is a form of revenge. Even if justified in the author's mind, public spaces have mutual expectations of respect. Retaliating in kind might not be the best approach. However, the lady had already broken the norm first. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Legally, maybe not, but socially, it's about what's considered acceptable. The author's action was a direct response to the lady's behavior. The author's action was a form of \"taste of her own medicine,\" which some might see as fair, while others might think it's taking it too far. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting someone's phone call is rude, but the lady's initial action was also rude. The author's retaliation, while a reaction to being interrupted, could be seen as equally rude. However, since the lady was the first to act inappropriately, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on perspective. If the author's action was a direct consequence and a way to teach the lady a lesson, some might argue it's justified. Others might say that both acted rudely, but the author's action was a poor response. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author's action was a form of self-defense in social terms, showing that both parties should respect each other. But since the author escalated the situation, leading to a conflict, that could be seen as wrong. \n\nIn summary, the lady started the problematic behavior, the author confronted politely but then retaliated. The retaliation might not be the best approach, but the initial behavior of the lady was worse. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but their response was a mistake. However, depending on cultural or social norms, the answer could vary. I think the answer is B (No), because the author was responding to someone else's rudeness, though their method was questionable. But technically, they weren't in the wrong since they were reacting to the lady's actions.\n"
