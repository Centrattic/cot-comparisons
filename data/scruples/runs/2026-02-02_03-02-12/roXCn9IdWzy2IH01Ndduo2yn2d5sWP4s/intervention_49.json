Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after an incident at the airport. The situation involves a lady playing her iPad loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video at full volume after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, the lady was using a public space and not using headphones, which can be seen as inconsiderate. The author initially tried to handle it by putting in earbuds, which is a reasonable first step. Then the lady interrupted the author's phone call, which the author argues is more acceptable. The author's response was to play a video loudly in return. \n\nLegally, both are in a public space, and neither has a clear right to use audio without headphones. However, the author's retaliation might be considered equally rude. While the lady's initial behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response escalated the situation, leading to conflict. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both actions are inconsiderate, but the author's action was a direct response, which could be seen as tit-for-tat. But is the author in the wrong? The initial action of the lady was rude, but the author's response was also rude. However, the key is whether the author had the right to retaliate. Usually, in public spaces, it's expected to use headphones, but the author was already using earbuds for their phone call. The author's counteraction was to play a video loudly, which is a form of escalation. \n\nThere's a concept of \"two wrongs don't make a right,\" so even if the lady was at fault first, the author's response might still be wrong. But the author's actions were a direct consequence of the lady's behavior. However, the correct approach would be to de-escalate, not retaliate. \n\nSo, while the lady was initially at fault, the author's response could be seen as in the wrong because it was a retaliatory act rather than a peaceful resolution. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be that both are at fault, but the author's action was a proportionate response in their own defense, so they might not be in the wrong. However, legally and socially, using headphones in public is expected, and the author's retaliation could be seen as equally wrong. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's action was justified as self-defense or a right to reciprocate. In many cases, people might argue that the author was being fair, but others might say that both actions are wrong. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because the lady's initial behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's response was a way to make a point. However, there's a case to be made that both are at fault. But the question is specifically about the author. If the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer is probably B (No) because the author was responding to the lady's inconsiderate behavior, even if the method was extreme. But some might argue A because both actions were rude. However, the initial act was more of a passive response, while the author's was active retaliation. So the answer might be B.\n"
