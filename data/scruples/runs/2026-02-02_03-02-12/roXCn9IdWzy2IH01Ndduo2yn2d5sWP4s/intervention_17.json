Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores her and puts in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her, pointing out that her behavior is actually rude. The author then plays a music video full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, the woman was being inconsiderate by using her device loudly in a public space. The author's initial response was to ignore her and use earbuds, which is reasonable. When the woman interrupts, the author responds politely but firmly, which seems fair. The key point is whether the author's retaliation\u2014playing loud music\u2014is justified.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a form of payback. While the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response might escalate the situation. Public spaces often have rules against loud audio, so both sides might be violating the same unspoken etiquette. However, the woman's initial action was more disruptive, as her show was audible to others. The author's retaliation, while maybe satisfying, could be seen as equally rude. But since the woman started it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the author could have de-escalated by just stopping the call or moving, but they chose to retaliate. Legal rights might be on the author's side if the airport allows personal audio, but social norms might judge both. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up, but the woman was the first to be rude. The author's action was a form of social justice, but maybe not the best approach. So, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
