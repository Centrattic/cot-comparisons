Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was sitting next to a woman at the airport who was watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author initially ignored it by putting in earbuds. Then when the woman complained about the author's phone call, the author retaliated by playing a music video full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette in public spaces. The woman was using her device without headphones, which is generally considered rude because it disturbs others. The author first tried to handle it politely by using earbuds, which is a reasonable step. When the woman interrupted the author's call, the author confronted her calmly, pointing out the issue. The author's response was to match the woman's behavior by playing loud music, which escalated the situation.\n\nNow, the key question is whether retaliation like this is justified. In public, the expectation is that people should be considerate. The woman was clearly in the wrong by not using headphones, but the author's response of playing loud music seems to be a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. While the author's initial complaint was valid, the act of playing loud music in response might be seen as equally rude. However, the author might argue that it was a way to make the woman experience her own behavior.\n\nLegally, both are in a public space and have rights to their own actions, but social norms dictate that using headphones is necessary to avoid disturbing others. The author's action could be seen as a form of protest against the woman's behavior, but it's a bit of a tit-for-tat situation. However, the author's initial complaint was valid, so the retaliation might be considered a justified consequence in the author's eyes, even if it's not the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, responding with the same level of noise could be seen as inconsiderate and not a mature way to handle the situation. The author could have chosen to ignore further or report the woman to airport staff instead. By retaliating, the author might have crossed the line from being a passive observer to an active participant in the disturbance.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while the woman was clearly wrong, the author's response might not be the most appropriate. The answer could depend on cultural context, but generally, escalating a conflict in public is not advised. The author might not be in the wrong for pointing out the rude behavior, but the method of retaliation could be considered equally rude. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their response, even if their initial complaint was justified.\n"
