Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport. The lady sits next to the author, plays her iPad loudly. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author argues that her loud show is rude, and then to spite her, he starts playing a music video full volume on his iPad. The lady storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The lady was using her iPad without headphones in a public space, which is indeed impolite because others can hear it. The author tried to ignore her at first but when confronted, he explained that her behavior was rude. Then he escalated by playing his own loud video. \n\nThe key point here is about reciprocity and respect. The author's initial response was to point out her wrongdoing, which is reasonable. But then he took it a step further by doing the same thing she did. While she was wrong, retaliating in kind might not be the best approach. The author acknowledged he was right in his argument, but his action of playing loud music could be seen as equally rude. \n\nPublic spaces require mutual respect. Even if someone is being rude, responding with the same behavior can make the situation worse. The author's action might be seen as a form of payback, but it doesn't resolve the issue and could be considered equally inconsiderate. So while the lady was wrong first, the author's response might not be the right approach. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for escalating the situation with his own rude behavior.\n"
