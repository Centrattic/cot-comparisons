Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad without headphones, playing it loudly. The author (AITA) initially ignores it by putting on earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds politely but firmly, pointing out that the woman's behavior is the issue. Then, the author takes it further by playing a loud music video on their own iPad, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and etiquette in public spaces. Generally, using headphones for media consumption in public is expected to avoid disturbing others. The woman's action of playing her show loudly is considered rude. The author's initial response was polite but clear, which seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, when the author decides to retaliate by playing their own loud video, that's where it gets tricky. Even if the woman was being rude, the author's response crosses into retaliatory behavior. While the woman started it, the author's action of playing loud media is also a breach of public etiquette. The author could have continued to ignore the woman or left the situation, but instead chose to escalate it by doing the same thing. This might be seen as equally rude or even more so because it's a direct response to the woman's behavior. \n\nLegally, in public spaces, there are usually noise level regulations. If the woman was violating those, she would be in the wrong. But the author's action of playing loud media could also be a violation. So both might be at fault, but the author's response is more about escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. \n\nMoral standpoint: Retaliation isn't always the right approach, even if the other person is wrong. The author's action, while perhaps humorous, isn't the mature or appropriate response. It's a form of public shaming or payback, which can be seen as childish or confrontational. \n\nIn summary, the woman started the problem by being loud, but the author's response, while pointing out the issue, then taking it further by retaliating, might make the author equally at fault. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the situation. However, others might argue the author was just showing the woman her own behavior, hence B (not in the wrong). It's a bit of a gray area, but the key is the escalation of conflict through retaliation.\n"
