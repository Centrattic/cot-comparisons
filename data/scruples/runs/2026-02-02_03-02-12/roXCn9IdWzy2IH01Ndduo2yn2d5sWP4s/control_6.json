Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about someone in an airport who's annoyed by a woman watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call to complain, the author responds by playing a music video loudly on their own iPad, causing the woman to leave angrily.\n\nFirst, the key points: the woman was using a device without headphones, which is disruptive in a public space. The author was on a phone call, which is common, but the woman told them to be quiet. The author then retaliates by playing loud music. The question is whether this retaliation makes the author wrong.\n\nLegally, in public spaces, people are expected to maintain reasonable noise levels. The woman's loud show is disruptive, so she's in the wrong initially. However, the author's response\u2014playing loud music\u2014also disrupts others. Even if it's a form of getting back at her, it's still disruptive. The author could have handled it more politely, like politely asking her to lower her volume again or speaking to airport staff. By retaliating in kind, the author escalated the situation, which isn't a good solution. So, while the woman started it, the author's action was also inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
