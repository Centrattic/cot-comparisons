Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So, the person is asking if the author did the right thing in the airport situation. Let me recap the scenario. An older lady sits next to the author, watches a show on her iPad with loud audio. The author puts on earbuds to ignore it. Then the author makes a phone call, and the lady asks them to talk quietly because she can't hear her show. The author responds by pointing out that the lady is being rude by not using headphones. The lady insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video at full volume on their own device, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm, the key issue here is about public etiquette and responding to rude behavior. The author points out the lady's mistake first, which is fair. But then they escalate the situation by playing a video loudly in response. That seems like a direct retaliation. Even though the author initially had a point, playing the music video full volume is probably crossing a line. The lady was being inconsiderate, but the author's reaction is equally inconsiderate. Both parties were being rude, but the author's action was a deliberate act of getting back at her, which is not the best way to handle a conflict. So, even if the lady started it, the author's response could be seen as in the wrong because they took the interaction to a worse level. The correct approach would have been to maintain politeness and not mirror the rude behavior.\n"
