Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, there's a back-and-forth. The author then plays a music video full volume in response, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were appropriate. The core issue is about public etiquette regarding noise. The lady is being disruptive by watching her show loudly. The author's initial response is polite, pointing out the lady's rudeness. Then, the author sarcastically plays loud music, which escalates the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the lady was indeed being inconsiderate, but the author's retaliation with loud music could be seen as equally rude. Even if it's a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" it's still a public disturbance. The author's actions might be justified in some eyes as a response, but etiquette-wise, escalating with loud noise isn't acceptable. The key point is that both parties were being inconsiderate, but the author's response crosses into being disruptive as well. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they retaliated in a similarly rude manner.\n"
