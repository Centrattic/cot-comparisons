Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict at the airport between the author and an older lady. \n\nFirst, the lady sat next to the author and started watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignored it and put in earbuds. Then the author made a phone call using the earbuds, and the lady complained about the phone call being loud. The author responded by pointing out that the lady was the one being loud without headphones, which is actually rude. Then the author sarcastically agreed that they were wrong and proceeded to play a music video loudly in response, causing the lady to get angry and leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The lady was being inconsiderate by using her device without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author tried to handle it politely by pointing out the lady's behavior without escalating immediately. However, when the lady criticized the author's phone call, the author's response was to mock her by playing loud music. \n\nEven though the lady started it, the author's action of retaliating by playing loud music is probably not appropriate. While the lady was indeed at fault for not using headphones, the author's response could be seen as equally inconsiderate and confrontational. The situation escalated because of the author's choice to respond in kind, which might not be the right approach, even if the other person was wrong. \n\nIn public spaces, the expectation is to be considerate of others. Both parties were being disruptive, but the author's retaliation might be seen as crossing a line. So even if the lady was wrong, the author's action of playing loud music in response is also problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here because they chose to respond with the same inconsiderate behavior instead of de-escalating the situation.\n"
