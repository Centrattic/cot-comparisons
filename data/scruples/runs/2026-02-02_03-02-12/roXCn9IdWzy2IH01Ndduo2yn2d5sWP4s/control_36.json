Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores her but then uses earbuds for a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to lower his voice. The author responds politely but points out her loudness. Then the author sarcastically says he's wrong and plays a music video loudly on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was indeed being loud, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author first uses earbuds, which is the correct approach. When confronted by the woman, he responds politely but challenges her behavior, which is reasonable. However, the key part is when he sarcastically agrees with her and then plays the music video loudly. This seems like retaliation. While the woman started it, deliberately playing loud media as a form of payback might be crossing a line. The author's action was public and intentional to make a point, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it was a response to her. So, while the woman was initially at fault, the author's reaction might be excessive and thus in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
