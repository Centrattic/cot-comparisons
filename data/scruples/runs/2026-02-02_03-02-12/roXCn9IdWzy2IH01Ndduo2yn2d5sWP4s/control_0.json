Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author ignores it at first, uses earbuds, and then makes a phone call. The woman gets upset and tells the author to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the woman's loud behavior and then plays a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author acted inappropriately. The initial issue is the woman's loud iPad. The author made a phone call, which can be considered normal in an airport, but the woman found it disruptive. The author then confronts her, which might be a bit confrontational. Then, the author's response is to play a music video loudly, which is a direct retaliation. \n\nIn public spaces, both parties have to consider each other's comfort. The woman was indeed at fault for not using headphones, as many public places have noise policies. However, the author's retaliation by playing loud media seems to escalate the situation. While the author's initial response was to point out the woman's mistake, the retaliation was not just a polite correction but a direct and equal counteraction, which might be seen as tit-for-tat. \n\nLegally, both might have the right to use their devices, but etiquette in public spaces usually involves being considerate. The author's action of playing loud music in response could be seen as equally rude, even if it's a form of giving her a \"taste of her own medicine.\" So, while the woman started the issue, the author's response might be considered inconsiderate and thus in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because retaliating with loud noise was excessive and unkind, even if the initial behavior was also wrong.\n"
