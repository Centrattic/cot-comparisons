Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a loud music video after being confronted.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The older lady uses an iPad without headphones, which is disruptive. The author initially ignores it but then uses earbuds. When the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely. Then the woman accuses the author of being rude. The author pretends to agree but then plays loud music, leading the woman to leave angry.\n\nNow, evaluating right and wrong. Public spaces have norms about noise. The woman's behavior is clearly disruptive by not using headphones. The author's initial response was to use earbuds and then politely address the issue. However, when the woman continues, the author escalates by playing loud music. While the author's point is valid\u2014both are using devices without headphones\u2014the author's retaliation might be seen as equally disruptive. But the key is intent. The author was pointing out hypocrisy by mirroring the behavior. Legally, both might have the right to use their devices, but socially, using headphones is expected. The author's action was a form of social commentary, showing hypocrisy. So, technically, the author isn't in the wrong because they highlighted the woman's misbehavior, but the method was confrontational. However, public behavior should ideally be respectful regardless of provocation. But given the context, the author's response was a pointed lesson, which might be justified. So, answer B (No).\n"
