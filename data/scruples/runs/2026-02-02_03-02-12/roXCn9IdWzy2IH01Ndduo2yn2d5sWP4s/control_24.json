Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing in the airport situation. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nSo, there's this older lady sitting next to the author in the airport. She's watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author puts in earbuds to ignore it. Then the author makes a phone call using the earbuds, but the lady interrupts and tells them to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out that she's being loud and that phone calls aren't as rude as loud devices. The lady claims she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume on their own iPad, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about public etiquette and reciprocity. The lady was using her device loudly in a public space, which is generally considered rude. The author used earbuds to avoid the noise, but when the lady complained about the phone call, the author retaliated by playing loud music. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the lady was being disruptive, so the author might feel justified in responding in kind. However, retaliating by playing loud music could escalate the situation and is also disruptive. Even if the author is upset, using the same rude behavior might not be the right approach. \n\nPublic spaces require mutual respect. While the lady's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response of playing loud music could be seen as equally rude. It's a form of tit-for-tat, which might not be the best way to handle conflicts. The author could have chosen to ignore the lady further or report the situation to an airport staff member instead of escalating it. \n\nSo, even though the lady was wrong initially, the author's retaliation might not be justified. Both parties were being inconsiderate, but the author's action was a direct response that also caused disturbance. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for choosing that method of response.\n"
