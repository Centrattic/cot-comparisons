Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict in an airport between two people.\n\nFirst, the older lady is watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author, instead of confronting her, puts in their earbuds to avoid the noise. Then, the author makes a phone call using those earbuds. The lady interrupts and tells them to be quiet so she can hear her show. The author responds politely, pointing out that her loud show is the problem. The lady insists she's right, and the author says they're wrong, then plays a loud music video on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the author's action here is a form of retaliation. The key question is whether this retaliation is justified. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is a common courtesy in public places. The author's initial response was to ignore it, which is reasonable. Then, when confronted, the author points out the lady's mistake. However, the author takes it a step further by playing loud music themselves, which the lady then leaves over.\n\nNow, the main point is about right and wrong. While the lady was at fault for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music is also violating the same courtesy. The author is essentially doing to the lady exactly what they were upset about. So even though the author's initial point is valid, their action crosses into being inconsiderate as well. The author could have chosen to just end the call or not escalate the situation, but by playing loud music, they are committing the same infraction. Therefore, the author's action, while a humorous or dramatic form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" is still a breach of public etiquette. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't just address the issue but retaliated in kind, making them equally at fault in the context of public behavior.\n"
