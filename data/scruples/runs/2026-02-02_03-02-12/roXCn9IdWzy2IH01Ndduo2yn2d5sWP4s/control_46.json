Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman in the airport who's watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author, instead of confronting her directly, uses earbuds to avoid the noise. Then, when the woman interrupts him during a phone call, he responds by playing a music video full volume on his own device, causing her to leave angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both parties' actions. The woman was definitely being rude by watching her show at a loud volume in a public space. Using headphones is the norm there, so she's violating a common courtesy. The author tried to ignore it initially, which is understandable. But when she interrupted his phone call, he decided to retaliate by playing his own video loudly.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author's response was appropriate. Even though her behavior was rude, the author's action of playing loud media as a form of payback might be seen as escalating the conflict. Retaliation with the same behavior could be considered wrong because it doesn't resolve the issue and instead causes more disruption. The author could have addressed her rudeness more calmly, maybe by explaining that using headphones is expected in public, or asking the airline staff to intervene. By playing the music video, he's mirroring her inconsiderate action, which might not be the right approach even if she started it. The question is about whether he was in the wrong, and in such cases, mutual disruption usually isn't the solution. So the answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
