Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by retaliating against a woman who was being loud on an iPad at the airport.\n\nFirst, the woman was watching a show loudly. The author tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then, when the author made a phone call, the woman complained about the volume. The author pointed out that the woman was the one being loud, which is a valid point because in public spaces, using headphones is expected to avoid disturbing others. \n\nBut then, the author takes it a step further by playing a music video full volume on their own device. That's where it gets tricky. Even though the woman was in the wrong initially, retaliating by being equally loud might not be the best approach. While the author was making a point, their action could be seen as equally rude, creating a cycle of escalation. \n\nPublic spaces do require mutual respect. The author had the right to point out the woman's behavior, but responding by being loud themselves could be perceived as equally inconsiderate. It's possible the author was trying to teach a lesson, but that method might not be effective and could be seen as vengeful. \n\nSo, while the initial complaint was justified, the retaliation might not be. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for their response, even if their initial point was valid.\n"
