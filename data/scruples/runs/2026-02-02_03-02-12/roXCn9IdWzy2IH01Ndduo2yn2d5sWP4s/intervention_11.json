Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, after being asked to lower their phone call, responds by playing a music video loudly on their own device, causing the woman to leave angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman was using her device without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public. The author tried to politely point this out. However, when the woman criticized the author's phone call, the author escalated the situation by playing loud music. \n\nEven though the author's initial response was polite, using the woman's own behavior against her by creating a louder disturbance might be crossing a line. While the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's retaliation could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding in kind might not be the best approach, even if justified. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response or if they took it too far. Since they escalated the situation beyond a polite conversation, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong). But there's a counterargument that the author was defending their right to use the phone normally. However, playing music full volume as retaliation is likely excessive. So, probably A is the correct answer.\n"
