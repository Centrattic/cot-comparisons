Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they retaliated against a woman who was being loud on her iPad. First, I need to understand the scenario properly.\n\nSo, the author is in an airport, a lady sits next to them and watches a show loudly. The author uses earbuds and ignores it at first. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the woman interrupts to tell them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her own loud behavior, which the woman denies. Then the author plays a music video full volume without earbuds, causing the woman to leave angrily.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions. They want a yes or no answer based on whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the initial action. The woman was being loud, which is generally considered rude in public. The author, using earbuds, chose to avoid confrontation at first. Then, when the woman interrupted the call, the author politely but firmly pointed out her own loudness. That part seems fair; addressing the issue directly and politely is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the author's response of playing the music video full volume is the key part. Even though the woman was in the wrong, retaliating in the same way (using loud volume) could be seen as escalating the conflict. The author's action might be considered equally rude, even if it's a form of \"taste of their own medicine.\" \n\nIn public spaces, there are usually guidelines about acceptable noise levels. While the woman was violating them, the author's response might not be the appropriate way to handle it. Instead of matching her loudness, a better approach might have been to calmly explain the issue again or seek help from airport staff. Retaliation can lead to a cycle of escalation and may not be the most constructive or polite response, even if the other person started it.\n\nSo, the author's action of playing the music video loudly could be seen as inconsiderate and rude, regardless of the provocation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using the same disruptive method, even if their initial complaint was valid. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
