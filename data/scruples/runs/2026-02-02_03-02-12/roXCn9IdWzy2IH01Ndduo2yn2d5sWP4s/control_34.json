Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author initially ignores it but then uses earbuds to make a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loudness, which leads to a confrontation. Then, the author plays a music video full volume on their iPad, causing the woman to leave.\n\nFirst, the woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones in a public space. The author, while making a phone call, which is generally acceptable, was interrupted. The author defends their action by highlighting the woman's behavior, which is a reasonable response. However, retaliating by playing loud music is where it gets tricky. The author's action mirrors the woman's inconsiderate behavior, which could be seen as escalating the conflict. Even though the author was provoked, responding in kind might not be the right approach. Public spaces do require mutual respect, so both parties have some responsibility. The woman shouldn't have been loud, and the author shouldn't have retaliated. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the key point is the retaliation. While the author had a point about the woman's behavior, responding by playing loud music crosses into being rude themselves. So, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud behavior.\n"
