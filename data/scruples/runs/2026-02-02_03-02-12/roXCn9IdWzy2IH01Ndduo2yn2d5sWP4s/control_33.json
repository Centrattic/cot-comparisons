Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author first ignores it and puts on earbuds. Then when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her, pointing out that her behavior is rude. The author then sarcastically complies by playing music loudly on their own device, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to think about the ethics here. The lady was indeed being rude by watching her show at loud volume without headphones. The author tried to be polite first, then explained the issue. But when the lady refused to acknowledge her mistake, the author retaliated by playing loud music. \n\nIs retaliation justified? Public spaces have norms about noise. The lady's initial action was inconsiderate, but the author's response escalated the situation. Even though the author made a point, using the same tactics could be seen as hypocritical. The author could have just stopped their call or moved seats instead of responding in kind. So, while the lady was wrong, the author's method of \"teaching a lesson\" might not be right. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they escalated the conflict instead of resolving it peacefully.\n"
