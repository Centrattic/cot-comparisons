Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict in an airport over noise levels.\n\nFirst, the older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and puts on earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts and asks them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the lady's loud behavior and then, in a sarcastic way, plays a music video full volume on their own device. The lady gets angry and leaves.\n\nSo, the author is defending their actions by saying they were just giving the lady a taste of her own behavior. I need to determine if the author's response was appropriate or if they crossed a line.\n\nThe key points here are about public behavior and mutual respect. The lady was indeed being inconsiderate by watching a show loudly. However, the author's reaction of playing music full volume in response might not be the best way to handle it. While the lady started the conflict, the author's retaliation could escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nEven though the author was polite at first, the final action of playing a loud music video in retaliation is not a proportional response. It's not just about correcting the behavior but also about maintaining composure and not engaging in the same inconsiderate behavior. The author's actions could be seen as equally rude, even if it's a form of payback. \n\nIn public spaces, it's generally expected to handle such situations with restraint. Retaliating in a similar manner might make the author equally at fault. So, while the lady was wrong first, the author's choice to respond in kind with loud noise might place them in the wrong as well. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. They escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it, even if their intention was to point out the lady's mistake.\n"
