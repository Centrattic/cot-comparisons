Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict in an airport between the author and an older lady. The lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author first puts in earbuds to ignore it. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by playing a music video loudly on their own iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The lady was using her device without headphones, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The author initially tried to avoid confrontation by using earbuds. When the lady complained about the phone call, the author pointed out the lady's own behavior. Then, as a form of retaliation, the author played a video loudly, which escalated the situation.\n\nLegally, in public spaces, there are usually rules about noise levels. The lady's actions could be seen as a disturbance. The author's response, however, involved playing their own loud video, which could be considered equally disruptive. So even if the lady was at fault, the author's retaliation might not be justified. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The key points are: the lady was being loud, the author tried to avoid conflict, then responded in kind. The question is whether the author's action crosses a line. Retaliation with similar behavior might not be the right approach, even if the other person was wrong. So while the lady was in the wrong first, the author's response could be seen as equally wrong because it's not addressing the issue constructively. Therefore, the author might still be in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud behavior.\n"
