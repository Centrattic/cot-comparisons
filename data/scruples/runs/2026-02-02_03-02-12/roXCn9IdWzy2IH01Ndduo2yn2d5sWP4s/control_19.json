Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores her and puts in earbuds. Then when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, he responds by playing a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nHmm. So, the first thing to consider is the initial behavior of the woman. Playing media loudly in a public place like an airport is generally considered rude because it affects others. The author's reaction is to make a phone call using earbuds, which is more considerate. But the woman complains, so the author retaliates by playing a loud music video. \n\nNow, the question is, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the woman was being loud, the author's response was to play something loud in return. That seems like a tit-for-tat approach. But is that justified? While the woman's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's retaliation might also be seen as rude. Public spaces are shared, so reacting with similar inconsiderate behavior might escalate the situation. \n\nAlso, the author said he agreed he was wrong and then did the same thing. That's a bit of a paradox. Maybe it was a sarcastic way of pointing out her hypocrisy. But even so, playing loud music in the airport is against the rules. The author's action was likely an overreaction. \n\nSo, even though the woman was at fault first, the author's response was equally inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is also in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
