Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady watching a show loudly on her iPad at the airport, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being asked to be quiet during a phone call.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady is using a public space, which typically expects consideration for others. Playing media without headphones can be disruptive because others can hear it. The author initially ignores the noise but then, after being interrupted during their own phone call, confronts the lady. The author points out the inconsistency in the lady's behavior, noting that public areas require everyone to be mindful of others.\n\nThen, the author decides to play a loud video as a form of retaliation. This action is key here. Even though the lady was being loud, the author's response mirrors her behavior. The question is whether this retaliation makes the author at fault. In public spaces, mutual respect is important. While the lady started the disruption, the author's reaction escalates the situation. Legally, there's no right to retaliate by causing the same disturbance. The author's action, while perhaps a humorous or symbolic response, could be seen as equally inconsiderate. So, even if the lady was in the wrong first, the author's choice to escalate might place them in the wrong as well. The correct answer would be A (Yes), because both parties acted inconsiderately, but the author's action was a direct retaliation which isn't acceptable in public settings.\n"
