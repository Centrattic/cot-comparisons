Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this airport story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author is using earbuds, but when making a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask him to quiet down. The author responds by pointing out that she's being rude by not using headphones, then later takes out their own iPad and plays a video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The lady is using her device loudly in public. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds, which is reasonable because maybe they don't want to confront her. Then when the author makes a phone call, which is a common activity in public, the lady interrupts to ask him to talk quieter. The author responds by pointing out her behavior, which is valid because using headphones is standard in public. But then the author goes a step further by playing a music video full volume, which seems like retaliation.\n\nThe key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The lady's action of watching a show loudly is indeed rude and against typical social norms. The author has a valid point there. However, when the author responds by playing their own video loudly, that's a tit-for-tat response, which escalates the situation. Even though the author's initial criticism was justified, retaliating with the same behavior isn't appropriate. Both parties have a right to use their devices, but in public spaces, it's expected to use headphones or keep the volume low to avoid disturbing others.\n\nSo, while the lady was wrong first, the author's response of playing loud video after being asked to quiet their phone call crosses a line. The author could have resolved the situation by using headphones for their call or moving away, but instead chose to mirror the rude behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they escalated the conflict rather than de-escalating it.\n"
