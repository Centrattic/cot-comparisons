Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author is initially polite, putting in earbuds and ignoring the noise. Then the author makes a phone call, which the woman objects to, telling them to quiet down. The author responds by pointing out the woman's loud iPad is also rude, and then plays a music video full volume, causing her to get angry and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Public spaces like airports have unspoken rules about noise. People generally expect others to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The woman was violating that by not using headphones, which the author points out. When the author makes a call, it's a reasonable action, but maybe the timing was off because the woman was already upset. \n\nThe author's response to the woman's complaint was to argue that the woman was being rude and then escalate by playing loud music. Even though the author might have been right about the woman's original behavior, retaliating in kind by playing loud music could be seen as equally rude. The author's actions might not be as justified because they took it to an extreme. \n\nBut on the other hand, the woman was the initial aggressor by not using headphones. The author could have just ignored her or calmly reinforced the norm without escalating. However, by playing loud music, the author mirrored the woman's behavior, which might be seen as a form of giving her own medicine. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the woman was wrong to not use headphones and disrupt others. The author was within their rights to point that out. But when the author responded by playing loud music, even if it was a reaction to the woman's prior actions, it might cross into being rude themselves. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. The woman was clearly violating norms first, but the author's retaliation could be seen as equally rude. However, since the author was defending against the initial wrongdoing, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the method of response was harsh. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they escalated the situation rather than de-escalating it. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe they're justified in showing the woman her own behavior. Hmm.\n"
