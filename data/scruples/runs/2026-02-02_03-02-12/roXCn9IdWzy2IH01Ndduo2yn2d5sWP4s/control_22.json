Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person in an airport who's annoyed by a woman watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds but then makes a phone call, which gets interrupted by the woman asking him to be quiet. He argues with her, and then in a sarcastic way, plays a loud video on his own device, leading her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are about public etiquette and reciprocity. The woman was being loud without headphones, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The author responds by making a phone call, which is also a form of talking, but in a public area, that's acceptable unless it's disruptive. However, when she confronts him, he responds by playing loud music on his device, which is the same behavior she was accused of. \n\nThe question is whether the author's retaliation is wrong. Even if the woman was at fault initially, the author's response of doing the same thing he criticized her for is a form of tit-for-tat. While it's understandable that he was annoyed, intentionally mirroring her behavior to show her the effect of her actions could be seen as a justified point, but it's still aggressive. However, public spaces have norms that people should respect each other's space. Both parties might have violated these norms, but the author's escalation could be seen as the final straw. \n\nBut the user wants a judgment on whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author took it upon himself to retaliate in the same way, even if he had a point, his method of confronting her was confrontational and possibly escalated the situation unnecessarily. So, while the woman was initially at fault, the author's actions might also be considered wrong because he didn't resolve it calmly. However, the user's options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nIn many public etiquette scenarios, retaliating in the same manner isn't considered acceptable, even if the other person was wrong. The correct approach is to address the issue politely without matching the behavior. Therefore, the author's decision to play loud music in response, even sarcastically, is likely the wrong action. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
