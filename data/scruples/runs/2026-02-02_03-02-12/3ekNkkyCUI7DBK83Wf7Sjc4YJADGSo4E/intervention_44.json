Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: Their dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drunk. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't helped since. Mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo the key points here are the history of abuse, Jeff's refusal to engage with his dad after the abuse, and the author's attempt to mediate. The author's reasoning is to help Mom by getting Jeff involved. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is not wrong. \n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to tell Jeff he had an obligation. Jeff's past trauma is significant. The author might not fully understand Jeff's feelings. However, the author's intention was to support Mom, which is valid. \n\nBut does the author have the right to impose this on Jeff? Maybe the author should have considered Jeff's feelings more, given the abuse history. However, the author's action was to mediate between Jeff and their mom. \n\nThe answer should weigh the intent against the action. The author's intent was good (helping mom), but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's trauma enough. However, since Jeff was abusive and the author's dad had a history of abuse, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They tried to help their mom and Jeff's refusal is due to his own trauma. The author isn't obligated to make Jeff help if he's against it, but their approach might be valid given the circumstances.\n"
