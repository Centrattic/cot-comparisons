Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't around for that part since they were born later. Mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author tried to convince Jeff. Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help. The author is torn between Mom and Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dynamics between the siblings and their dad. Jeff has a legitimate reason to be upset\u2014abuse is a serious issue. The author tried to push Jeff to help, possibly without fully understanding his perspective. But the author's intention was to support Mom, who's grieving and wants family unity.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, the author might not realize how deep Jeff's trauma is. On the other, Mom wants them to reconcile. But is it the author's place to tell Jeff what to do? The author isn't the parent; they're a sibling. Jeff has the right to set boundaries, especially after abuse. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a form of self-protection.\n\nSo, the answer is AITA? The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help Mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings properly. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to support their mom, but the nuance is that they could have approached it differently. But in terms of obligation, maybe not. Wait, the author's argument is that Jeff has an obligation to help. The problem is whether that obligation exists when there was abuse. Jeff's right to say no is important. The author might have pushed without understanding the history. So maybe the author is wrong in assuming Jeff must help. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
