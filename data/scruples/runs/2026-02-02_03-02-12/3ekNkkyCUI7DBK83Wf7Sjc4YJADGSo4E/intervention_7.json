Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father, the brother Jeff who had a really hard time with their dad, and now the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral for their mom's sake.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drinking, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home when he was 18, and the author was only 13 then. The dad died, and now the author and mom are trying to plan the funeral, but Jeff refuses to help. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him that he's making mom upset by not helping and that Jeff should stop being a dick. Jeff got angry, called the author an idiot, and refused to help. The author is caught between wanting to help their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Jeff he should help. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider ethics and social norms here. Family obligations can be tricky, especially after abuse. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. On the other hand, Jeff has a valid reason not to want to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him. The author's intention was good, but maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings more before urging him to help. However, the author mentions that Jeff isn't helping at all, and the mom is upset. The author's action was to mediate, but Jeff's response was hostile. \n\nIs it wrong to ask a family member to help with a funeral? Well, in many cultures, there's an expectation that family will help with funerals. However, when there's a history of abuse, that expectation might not apply. The author might not be wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma. However, the author didn't force Jeff; they just asked him. Jeff has the right to say no, but the author tried to appeal to his sense of duty for mom's sake.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to mediate and help their mom, which is a valid concern. Jeff's refusal is his choice, but the author's action was justified in wanting to support their mom. So the answer would be B.\n"
