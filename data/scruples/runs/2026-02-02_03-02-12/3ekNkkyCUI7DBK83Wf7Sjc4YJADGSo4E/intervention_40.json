Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home early and hasn't been in contact. Now, after the dad's death, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help, which led to an argument. Jeff was angry, called the author an idiot, and refused to participate. The author is caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's trauma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical side. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. They might not have realized how deep Jeff's resentment was. However, the dad was abusive, so Jeff's refusal is understandable. The author might have thought it's important for family unity during the funeral, especially for the mom's sake. But maybe they didn't consider the emotional impact on Jeff.\n\nIs there a duty to attend a parent's funeral? It's a cultural and personal matter. Some might argue there is a duty, others might say the victim's right to refuse. The author might have assumed Jeff had an obligation without considering his past trauma. But they did try to convince Jeff kindly, emphasizing Mom's feelings. Jeff's reaction was hostile, but the author's approach was to mediate, not force.\n\nWas the author wrong? They might be in a no-win situation. Supporting the mom is natural, but respecting Jeff's trauma is also important. The author might have acted out of good intentions but didn't account for Jeff's emotional state. However, the author didn't force Jeff and was trying to help the family. It's a gray area, but the author's actions were well-meaning. So, they're not in the wrong.\n"
