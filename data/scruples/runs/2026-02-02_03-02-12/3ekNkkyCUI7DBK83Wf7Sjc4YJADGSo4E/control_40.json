Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral. The situation involves a family with an abusive dad, a mom who stayed with him, and two kids. The older brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad, even being abused when their dad drank. The younger sibling (the author) wasn't around that abuse as much because their dad mellowed out after they were born. \n\nThe dad died, and the mom is trying to plan the funeral but Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help for their mom's sake. Jeff got angry, said he wouldn't help, and the author now feels torn between mom and Jeff.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he had an obligation. The key points here are about family obligations versus personal trauma. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has a history of abuse from their dad, which might make him reluctant to participate. \n\nObligations can be cultural or family-based. If the family expects all siblings to participate in funeral arrangements, the author might think Jeff should contribute. However, considering Jeff's experiences, forcing him to engage could be retraumatizing. The author might not have considered how their approach made Jeff feel, which could have been a more empathetic approach.\n\nThe author approached Jeff in a way that framed it as an obligation, which Jeff took as a demand, possibly triggering his resentment. The author could have tried to understand Jeff's perspective better before insisting on help. For example, maybe exploring alternatives like a smaller service or other ways Jeff could contribute that he's comfortable with. However, the author's main goal was to support their mom, which is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting Jeff's boundaries and supporting their mom. The author's action might have been well-intentioned, but the method could have been more considerate of Jeff's trauma. The obligation argument might not be valid if Jeff's mental health is a priority. Therefore, the author might be in the right in wanting to help their mom, but the approach could be questioned. However, in terms of the question of whether the author is in the wrong, since they acted out of concern for their mom and didn't have malicious intent, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the answer might depend on whether the obligation is realistic given Jeff's history. The answer could lean towards No (B), but there's nuance here.\n"
