Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive when the brother Jeff was younger, but after the author was born, he mellowed out. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, and Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help. The author is now unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nThe key points here are the family dynamics and the nature of the request. The author's intent was to help their mom by involving Jeff in the funeral, which makes sense because family support is important, especially for someone who's grieving. However, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to the past abuse. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma, but their motivation was to ease their mom's distress.\n\nIs it wrong to ask Jeff to help? Well, the author didn't force Jeff; they just urged him out of concern for their mom. The brother's refusal is his personal choice, and the author's approach could be seen as trying to mediate a family conflict. The author might not have considered Jeff's perspective fully, but their actions were driven by trying to support their mother. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
