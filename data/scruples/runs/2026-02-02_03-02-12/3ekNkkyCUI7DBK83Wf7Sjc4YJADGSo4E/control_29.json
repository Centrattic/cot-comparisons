Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their older brother he must help with their dad's funeral, despite the abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, even though he mellowed out later. Jeff left home early and hasn't been involved since. Now that the dad died, the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff refuses to help, calling the dad an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the ethical implications. The author is trying to support their mom by pushing Jeff to help, even though Jeff has valid reasons not to want to participate due to past abuse. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing that? Well, they're trying to help their mom, which is understandable. But they might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma from the abuse. The author might not realize that forcing Jeff to participate could retraumatize him. However, the author also hasn't considered alternative solutions, like the mom handling things separately or finding other ways to honor the dad without Jeff's involvement. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was good, to ease their mom's burden. But they might have overstepped by making it Jeff's obligation, not considering his feelings. Jeff's refusal is a valid response given his past. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because they were trying to help, but they could have handled it differently, like discussing with mom first or finding another way to support her without pressuring Jeff. \n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author acted with good intentions but didn't fully consider Jeff's perspective, maybe they aren't in the wrong, but there's room for criticism. The answer here might lean towards B (No), because the author's intention was to support their mom and they might not have known the extent of Jeff's trauma. However, they could have approached it more sensitively. But the options are A or B. Given the scenario, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
