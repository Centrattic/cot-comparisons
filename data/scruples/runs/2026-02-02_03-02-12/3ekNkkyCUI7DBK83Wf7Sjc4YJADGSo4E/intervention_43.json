Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother to help with the funeral of their abusive dad. The situation involves family dynamics, past abuse, and differing responses to the father's death.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother Jeff had a terrible relationship with their dad\u2014physical abuse, yelling, etc. He moved out at 18 and hasn't been in touch. The author, who was born later, experienced a mellowed-out dad, possibly due to sobriety. Now, the dad is dead, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help and calling the author names.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author tried to mediate a family conflict. They were acting on their mom's request to get Jeff involved. However, Jeff's refusal is rooted in his traumatic experiences. The author might have assumed Jeff should help because of family obligations, but Jeff's perspective is different. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? It's complicated. Family obligations can be seen as a duty, but when there's a history of abuse, those obligations might be less clear. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings as much as they could have. \n\nHowever, the author didn't force Jeff; they just asked him to help. Jeff's reaction was hostile, but the author's action was a reasonable attempt to resolve the situation. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Since the author was acting as a mediator and not imposing a demand, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. \n\nJeff's choice to disengage from the funeral is his right, given his past. The author's mistake might have been not understanding Jeff's trauma, but it's not a clear case of being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
