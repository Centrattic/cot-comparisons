Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. The brother Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, refused to help, and called the author out. The author is torn between mom and Jeff's feelings.\n\nSo the key points here: the author's reasoning for approaching Jeff, Jeff's justification for not helping, and the moral obligation aspect. The question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they probably think they're helping mom by getting Jeff to participate, especially since Jeff's absence is hurting mom. But Jeff has a valid reason too\u2014he was abused by their dad. The author might not fully understand the trauma Jeff went through. The author might be assuming that because Jeff is family, he's obligated to help, but Jeff's experience might make him not want any part in the funeral. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was trying to mediate between mom and Jeff. They might not have considered Jeff's feelings as much. The author could have approached the situation more sensitively. Maybe they didn't realize that Jeff's refusal is rooted in past trauma. But on the other hand, the author's intention was to help mom, which is understandable. However, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might be seen as pressuring someone who has reasons not to participate. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author was aware of Jeff's justifications. Since the author mentioned understanding why Jeff is upset, but still insisted on obligation, that might be the crux. Obligation can be a tricky word here. If Jeff doesn't want to be involved, even for mom's sake, after what their dad did, the author might be overstepping by pushing for his participation. But the author's intention was to help mom, which is a valid concern. But maybe the author should have considered Jeff's perspective more and not framed it as an obligation. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014no, the author isn't in the wrong. Because while they might have approached it with less sensitivity, their intention was to help their mom, and they had information about their dad's mellowing. However, maybe the way they framed it as an obligation could have been a mistake. But overall, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to mediate and their brother's refusal is based on past trauma, but the question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he had an obligation. The answer is B, not in the wrong, but perhaps the author could have handled it differently. Wait, but the author's position is that Jeff has an obligation, which Jeff might not agree with. Obligation is a strong word. So maybe the author is in the wrong for assuming that obligation exists. Hmm. Alternatively, in some cultures, family obligations are strong, so the author might think Jeff should help regardless. But Jeff's trauma could override that. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong because they had good intentions, but the framing might be questionable. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer is B, because they tried to help mom, even if the approach could be better. But I'm a bit conflicted. Another angle: the author didn't know if Jeff's memories were accurate, but mom confirmed some of it. The author might not be wrong in trying to help mom, but the obligation part might be the issue. I think the answer is B, but some might say A. Let me check the original question again. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation. Jeff's reason is valid. The author's reasoning might be based on the assumption that Jeff should help for mom's sake, but Jeff might not feel that. So telling him he has an obligation could be wrong. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014author is in the wrong. Wait, but the author's intention was to help mom, which is a valid reason. However, the author should have considered Jeff's feelings more. The key is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff he has an obligation. Since Jeff has a history of abuse, the author's statement that Jeff has an obligation might be the issue. So maybe the answer is A. Hmm. I'm torn. Let me think again. The author approached Jeff to help mom, which is understandable. But by framing it as an obligation, the author might be invalidating Jeff's trauma. So the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Therefore, answer A. But the author's intent was good. However, the action of imposing obligation could be wrong. So the answer is A. Wait, but in some contexts, family members are expected to help, even if there's past issues. But Jeff's trauma is a strong reason. The answer is B, because the author is not in the wrong for trying to help mom, but maybe the way they did it is the problem. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation. If Jeff's trauma is a valid reason to refuse, then the author was wrong to impose that obligation. Therefore, answer A. But the author didn't know what Jeff's trauma was? No, the author knew about the abuse from Jeff and mom. So the author should have been more sensitive. Therefore, answer A. So the answer is A. But I'm still unsure. Let me check similar examples. In AITA scenarios, pushing someone to participate in a funeral when they were abused is often seen as not the person's fault. Wait, no, it's the other way around. If someone is being forced to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them, that's a strong reason to not help. So the author was in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision. So answer A. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation when Jeff has a valid reason not to help. So answer A.\n"
