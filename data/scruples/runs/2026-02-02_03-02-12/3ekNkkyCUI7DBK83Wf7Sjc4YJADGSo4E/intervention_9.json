Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born, but Jeff left home at 18. Now the dad is dead, and Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff to help, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author's mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping. The author tried to mediate. The question is whether the author was wrong to pressure Jeff into participating in the funeral.\n\nOn one hand, Jeff might have valid reasons not to participate given the abuse. The dad wasn't a great person, and Jeff's trauma could make attending the funeral difficult. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and wants both children to be part of the funeral. The author might feel caught in the middle. The author's intention was to support the mom, so maybe they thought Jeff owed it to the family, especially since the dad improved later.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help? The author might not have considered that Jeff's trauma is still significant, but they also wanted to help their mom. It's a tough balance. Legally or morally, does Jeff have an obligation to help with the funeral of someone who abused him? Probably not. So the author might be assuming an obligation that doesn't exist. \n\nHowever, the author might have had good intentions, even if they didn't fully understand Jeff's perspective. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it more sensitively. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their mom, but maybe they should have been more understanding of Jeff's feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since Jeff was abusive, it's a moral gray area. The author might be right to want the family to come together, but Jeff's right to not participate is also valid. So the author's action isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach could be better. So the answer is B.\n"
