Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, even though the dad was abusive.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, when he was younger. He drank a lot, physically abused Jeff, and was verbally abusive to both Jeff and their mom. The writer, the younger sibling, wasn't subjected to the same treatment as Jeff. The dad mellowed out after the writer was born, got sober, and the family situation improved. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The writer went to Jeff to convince him to help, but Jeff lashed out, refusing to participate. The writer hasn't told their mom yet and is conflicted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong for telling Jeff he needs to help. The writer's intention was to support their mom, but Jeff had valid reasons for not wanting to participate. \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The writer might feel that Jeff has a responsibility to his family, especially for the mom's sake. But Jeff has been a victim of abuse and might have a right to distance himself from the situation. The writer's approach could be seen as pressuring Jeff to reconcile with a part of his past that he's unwilling to face. However, the writer's motivation was to help their mother, which is understandable.\n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, they didn't force Jeff into anything, just tried to encourage him. Jeff's refusal is his choice. The writer might have underestimated the depth of Jeff's trauma. But they were trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff. It's a complex situation where loyalty to family versus personal trauma is in conflict. The writer's action was to bridge the gap, which isn't inherently wrong, but maybe the expectation that Jeff must help is misplaced. However, the writer didn't do anything malicious. So, probably not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
