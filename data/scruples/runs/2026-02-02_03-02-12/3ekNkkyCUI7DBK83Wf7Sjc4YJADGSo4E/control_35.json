Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't reconciled. Now that the dad died, the mother wants Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff refuses. The author went to Jeff and told him he needs to help for Mom's sake, which led to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points are about obligation. Does Jeff have a moral or family obligation to help with a funeral for someone who was abusive to him? The author's intention was to support their mom, but Jeff feels justified in not participating due to past trauma.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to pay for a funeral unless specified, but morally, it's more complex. The author might feel that family should support each other, especially for the mother's emotional well-being. However, Jeff's refusal is rooted in his negative experiences with their dad. The author's approach might have been seen as pressuring Jeff, which Jeff found hurtful.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to help their mom, which is understandable. But maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings and the history more. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted out of concern for their mom, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation. Since Jeff's refusal is based on justified reasons, the author's assertion of obligation might be misplaced. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue the author should have respected Jeff's choice more. It's a gray area, but leaning towards B.\n"
