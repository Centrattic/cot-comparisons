Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to the older brother Jeff when he was younger, but after the author was born, he mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Now the dad has died, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place and told him he has an obligation to help Mom, which led to Jeff getting angry and refusing to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, so Jeff might have a valid reason to not want to participate in the funeral. The author, on the other hand, was not abused by their dad and might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. The author's mom is caught in the middle, feeling neglected by Jeff, but the author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is rooted in past trauma.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. The author's intention was to help Mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings and reasons for not wanting to be involved. Obligations can be tricky here. While family duties are common, in cases of abuse, people might have different boundaries. The author might have assumed Jeff should put aside the past, but Jeff's experience with the dad was traumatic, and forcing him to participate against his will could be invalidating.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be well-meaning but they didn't take into account Jeff's perspective. They told Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which could sound dismissive of his past. The right approach might have been to encourage communication without imposing expectations. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and not understanding his reasons. Alternatively, if the obligation is seen as a family duty, the author might not be wrong. But given the abuse context, it's more likely the author didn't handle it correctly.\n"
