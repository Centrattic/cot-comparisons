Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive father's funeral.\n\nFirst, the father was abusive when the brother was younger, but mellowed out later. The brother left home when he was 18, and now the father has died. The author's mom is upset because the brother isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to the brother, who reacted angrily, refusing to help.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were trying to help Mom by getting Jeff to contribute. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The key here is whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff into helping despite his trauma and refusal.\n\nMoral obligation can be tricky. While family obligations often exist, in cases of abuse, people have the right to set boundaries. The author might have been trying to support Mom, but they should respect Jeff's right to his own feelings. Maybe they should have focused on supporting Mom without making Jeff do something he's uncomfortable with.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to help Mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. However, the question is if they're in the wrong for stating their case. Since they tried to mediate and their intent was good, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the answer depends on whether pushing someone to help is justified despite their trauma. I think the answer is B.\n"
