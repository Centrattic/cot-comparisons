Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the older brother, Jeff, should help with the funeral of their abusive father. The author, the younger sibling, went to Jeff's house to convince him to help because their mom is upset. But Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. Jeff left as soon as he could, at 18, and hasn't looked back. The author was born later and wasn't subjected to the same abuse. Now that the dad is dead, the author and mom are handling the funeral, but Jeff is refusing to help. The author tried to convince him, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for asking Jeff to help? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. However, Jeff has a history of trauma and abuse from their dad. The question is whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff into participating in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him.\n\nOn one hand, family obligations can be important, especially for a funeral. The author might feel that since they are siblings, Jeff should help support their mom emotionally. But on the other hand, Jeff might have valid reasons to not want to participate in honoring someone who caused him so much pain. Forcing him to help could retraumatize him. The author might not fully understand Jeff's perspective, having not experienced the same abuse.\n\nThe author's approach might have been heavy-handed. Instead of telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" maybe a more empathetic approach, respecting Jeff's wishes, would have been better. The author's message might have come across as dismissive of Jeff's past trauma, hence why Jeff got so angry.\n\nAlso, the author's mom is upset, so there's a desire to support her, but the author might be overlooking Jeff's emotional needs. The author is caught between two difficult positions here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author had good intentions but might not have considered Jeff's feelings adequately. However, the author was trying to mediate a difficult situation. The key issue is the right to pressure someone to participate in a funeral for a family member who was abusive. In some cases, people disown abusive family members, and it's their choice. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's autonomy in this matter.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's decision and may have forced a family obligation onto him without considering his trauma.\n"
