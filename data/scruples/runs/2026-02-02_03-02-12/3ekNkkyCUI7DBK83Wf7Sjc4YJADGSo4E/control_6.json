Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The brother had a terrible childhood with an abusive father, and now the author is trying to get him to help with the funeral, which the brother refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father was abusive towards Jeff, which is a significant factor. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff reacted angrily. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, whether they're in the wrong depends on whether they overstepped or didn't respect Jeff's boundaries.\n\nThe author went to Jeff's house to convince him, which might be seen as respecting his space. But Jeff clearly stated he wouldn't help, so the author might have pushed too hard. The key points here are the nature of the relationship, Jeff's trauma, and the author's approach. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help despite his past? If the author respects Jeff's decision now, even if it's hard on their mom, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're forcing Jeff to participate in something he's unwilling to do because of his trauma, that could be an issue. However, the author's main concern is their mom's well-being. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to support their mom, and they approached Jeff in person. However, they might not have considered the depth of Jeff's feelings. But since they're caught between two people, they aren't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
