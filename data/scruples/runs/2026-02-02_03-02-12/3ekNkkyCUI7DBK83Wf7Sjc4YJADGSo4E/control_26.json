Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family where the dad was abusive, especially towards the older brother, Jeff. The author, the younger sibling, is now asking if they were wrong to tell Jeff he has an obligation to help with the funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The dad was abusive when Jeff was young, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back since. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author tried to convince Jeff, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the author's action was to tell Jeff he should help. But Jeff is clearly still hurt and angry about the past. The author might think it's about respecting their mom, but Jeff might feel that the dad's behavior was so bad that he doesn't want any part in the funeral. \n\nThe key points here are about obligation vs. personal feelings. The author is arguing that Jeff has a responsibility to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff's trauma might make it impossible for him to participate. The author might not realize the depth of Jeff's pain, especially since he wasn't there for the worst of it.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. They might have acted without understanding how much Jeff was affected. Also, the author's approach could have been more empathetic. Instead of telling Jeff he has an obligation, maybe the author should have suggested other ways to support Mom without Jeff's direct involvement, like taking on more responsibility themselves or finding a middle ground.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author was trying to help their mom, which is a valid concern. However, pushing Jeff might have been the wrong approach. Families can be complicated, and each person's healing process is different. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for telling Jeff he has to help. Since Jeff has his reasons based on past abuse, the author might be overstepping by demanding participation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were trying to support their mom, but it's complicated. However, some might argue that they should have respected Jeff's boundaries. But the main point is whether the author was wrong. Since Jeff's refusal is rooted in past trauma, the author's insistence could be seen as not respecting Jeff's feelings. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong (A). Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's intention was good, but the approach was flawed, does that make them in the wrong? The answer might depend on cultural expectations about family obligations. In some cultures, family members are expected to help regardless of past issues. In others, personal feelings might be prioritized. The author might not be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, the act of telling Jeff he has an obligation might have been wrong because it didn't account for Jeff's trauma. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and pushed for something he's not capable of doing given his history. But others might say that family responsibilities come first, so the author is right. This is tricky. I think the correct answer here is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to support their mom, but perhaps they could have handled it better. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If Jeff's trauma is valid and the author didn't respect that, then maybe they are in the wrong. Hmm. The line between supporting mom and respecting Jeff's boundaries is thin. The author's action was to tell Jeff he has an obligation, which might have been the wrong approach. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the details again. The author was told by Mom to convince Jeff. The author went to Jeff, told him he needs to help for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily. The author is caught between Mom and Jeff. The key is whether Jeff has a valid reason not to help. Since Jeff was abused, it's understandable. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but perhaps they should have found another solution instead of pressuring Jeff. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe they could have done better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is wrong. If B, then not. Given that Jeff's refusal is due to valid reasons, the author's insistence might be wrong. Therefore, the answer is A. But I'm still a bit confused. Some might say that family obligations are important regardless. But Jeff's mental health is also a factor. The author might have been wrong to not consider Jeff's mental state. So, A.\n"
