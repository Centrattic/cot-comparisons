Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff refused, citing past abuse.\n\nSo, the key points here are the obligation to help with a funeral, especially when there's a history of abuse. Legally, there's no obligation unless there's a will or specific laws, but emotionally, the author is trying to help their mom. Jeff's refusal is understandable given his past. The author might feel caught between their mom and brother.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, consider if the author overstepped. The author tried to mediate, perhaps assuming Jeff should help despite his reasons. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author might not have considered Jeff's trauma enough. However, the author's intention was to support their mom. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit gray. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to reconcile the family, but maybe they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries. However, since Jeff was abusive towards him in the past, the author's approach might have been too direct. But given the situation, the author's actions were from a place of trying to help their mom. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with nuances. The author isn't at fault for trying to get Jeff to help, but perhaps could have handled it differently. But based on the options, the answer is B.\n"
