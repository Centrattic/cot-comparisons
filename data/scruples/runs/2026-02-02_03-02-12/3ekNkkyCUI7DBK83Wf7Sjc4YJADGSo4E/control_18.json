Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The question is whether they were right to tell their older brother Jeff he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: Their dad was abusive towards Jeff and their mom when Jeff was younger. After the author was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18, and hasn't been in contact since. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo the author is caught between their mom's need for support and Jeff's understandable resentment. The key points to consider are the obligation to help with a funeral and whether the author was right to enforce that.\n\nFunerals are typically family affairs, and it's common for family members to contribute. However, if Jeff has a history of abuse, he might feel justified in cutting ties. The author's approach might have been to pressure Jeff, which could be seen as overstepping, especially if Jeff has chosen to distance himself from the family due to abuse. \n\nThe author's reasoning is for Mom's sake, but Jeff's feelings and trauma need to be considered too. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to support their mom, but they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nIf Jeff doesn't have an obligation if he's cut ties, then the author's insistence on obligation might be misplaced. On the other hand, if family ties are expected regardless of past issues, the author is right. But given the abuse and Jeff's choice to leave, the author might be in the wrong for pushing Jeff to participate against his will. \n\nI think the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to mediate between their mom and brother, even if Jeff is resistant. But also, the author might not be wrong in suggesting a family obligation, especially if the mom is suffering. However, the line between obligation and respect for Jeff's trauma is thin. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author is in the wrong because they forced their brother to confront something he's not ready for. The answer A or B depends on cultural expectations and the strength of the obligation. Given the situation, the author's intent was to help Mom, so maybe B is the choice here.\n"
