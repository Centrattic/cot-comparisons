Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their brother not helping with their father's funeral, even though the father was abusive. The author went to their brother to convince him to help for their mom's sake, but the brother got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father was abusive to the brother, so the brother's refusal might be justified from his perspective. The author is trying to mediate between their mom's needs and their brother's feelings. The key points are the father's abuse, the brother's justified anger, and the author's attempt to get the brother to help despite that.\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, the brother's refusal is based on valid reasons. The author might have overstepped by implying an obligation, especially considering the history. But the author's motivation is to support their mom, which adds complexity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother's refusal is due to legitimate trauma, then the author might have a point in trying to help, but the approach could be questioned. However, the author's action was to communicate their mom's distress and ask the brother to consider helping, not to force it. The brother's reaction was hostile, which might indicate that the author's approach wasn't the best, but it's not necessarily wrong to try. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether the action was reasonable. The author's action is in a gray area, but leaning towards not in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom and didn't force the brother. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
