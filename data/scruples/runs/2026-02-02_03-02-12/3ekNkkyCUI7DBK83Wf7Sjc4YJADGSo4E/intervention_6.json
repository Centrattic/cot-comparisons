Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father who was particularly harsh to Jeff when he was younger. The author tried to convince Jeff to help their mom, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was a child, and Jeff has been estranged from the family since he turned 18. Now that the dad has died, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author, trying to mediate, told Jeff he has an obligation to help for the mom's sake. Jeff's response was hostile, but the author is now conflicted.\n\nThe key points are: the dad was abusive, Jeff has a valid reason to feel resentment, the mom is grieving and needs support from both her children, and the author is caught in the middle. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help despite his past trauma.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom during a difficult time. However, they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. But since the author was acting out of concern for their mom and trying to resolve the conflict, their intention was good. Jeff's refusal is understandable given his history, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to ask. The author's obligation might be more to their mom, especially if Jeff had already chosen not to be involved. So the answer is B.\n"
