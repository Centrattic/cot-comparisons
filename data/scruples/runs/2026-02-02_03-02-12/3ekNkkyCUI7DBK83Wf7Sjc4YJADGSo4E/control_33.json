Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, the situation: the brother, Jeff, had a very bad relationship with their dad, who was abusive when he drank. The author wasn't around for that same level of abuse, maybe because their dad sobered up after the author was born. Now the dad has died, and the mother is upset because Jeff won't help with the funeral. The author approached Jeff, urging him to help for the mother's sake, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dynamics between the siblings and their father. Jeff had valid reasons to be upset with their dad. Abuse is a serious issue, and Jeff's trauma is real. The author, on the other hand, might not have experienced the same level of abuse, so maybe they don't fully grasp Jeff's feelings. \n\nThe author's intention was to support their mother by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff's refusal could be because he doesn't want to acknowledge his father's existence due to the trauma. The author might be in a position of not understanding the depth of Jeff's pain. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to mediate for their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. The author might have assumed Jeff should help because of familial obligations without acknowledging the abuse. But then again, the mother is grieving and needs support, and the author felt they had to act. \n\nHowever, Jeff's reaction (calling the author an idiot and refusing to help) shows that the author's approach might not have been the best. They might have been dismissive of Jeff's trauma by implying he should help regardless. But on the other hand, the author's position is to support their mother, which is also valid. \n\nThe ethical question here is whether the author had the right to push Jeff to participate in something that causes him emotional distress. Family obligations can be complex, especially when abuse is involved. The author might not be wrong for trying to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's right to disengage from their father's memory. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were respectful of Jeff's trauma while still trying to help their mom. If the author didn't acknowledge Jeff's valid reasons and instead pressured him, that could be a problem. But if they were trying to balance both sides, maybe they're not entirely wrong. The key is that Jeff has every right to distance himself from their father's funeral if it's too painful, and the author might not have approached the situation with enough sensitivity. So, the answer might be AITA for the author? Maybe they are partially wrong for not understanding Jeff's position.\n"
