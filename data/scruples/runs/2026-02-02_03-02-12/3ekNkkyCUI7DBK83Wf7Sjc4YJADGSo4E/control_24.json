Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral. The brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad when he was younger, and now he's refusing to help with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him he should help for their mom's sake, and Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Jeff has a valid reason to be upset with their dad. He was abused, which is serious. The author probably understands that but still felt it was their responsibility to approach Jeff. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, so the author tried to mediate.\n\nIs the author wrong for telling Jeff he should help? Well, maybe not. Jeff might not feel obligated to help someone who was abusive. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, forcing someone who has trauma to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be insensitive. The author might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and past trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom is grieving and needs support from both children. The author tried to bridge the gap but Jeff reacted negatively. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but maybe the approach could have been better. Maybe they should have respected Jeff's decision without pressuring him. But the author's intention was good.\n\nSo, the key points are: Jeff has a right to refuse due to past abuse; the author's intent was to help their mom; the author might not have considered Jeff's trauma enough. It's a gray area. But since Jeff has a legitimate reason to not participate, the author might be overstepping by telling Jeff he has an obligation. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe B if the author's action is seen as trying to support the mom without considering Jeff's trauma. Hmm.\n"
