Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, especially when drunk. The writer, the younger sibling, wasn't around for most of that because they were born later. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The writer went to Jeff's house to convince him to help, but Jeff got angry and refused, saying he won't help because of the abuse he endured.\n\nThe writer is now torn between supporting their mom's wishes and understanding Jeff's reasons. The question is whether the writer did the wrong thing by telling Jeff he should help.\n\nI should consider a few things here. First, the concept of obligation in such situations. Does Jeff have a moral or familial obligation to help with the funeral despite the abuse? Well, culturally, people might expect family members to participate in funerals, but if someone has been a victim of abuse, their feelings and needs are valid. The writer's intent was to help their mom, but they may not have fully considered Jeff's perspective or trauma.\n\nAlso, the writer approached Jeff directly and told him he \"has to\" help. That might come off as dismissive of Jeff's pain. The writer might have assumed that because their dad mellowed out, Jeff should overlook past issues, but that's not necessarily the case. Jeff's refusal could be justified given his traumatic experiences.\n\nAnother angle: the writer's mom is upset because Jeff isn't participating. The writer tried to mediate, but maybe the approach was confrontational. Instead of telling Jeff he has an obligation, maybe the writer should have tried to understand his reasons first or found a compromise.\n\nThe key point is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the writer overstepped by imposing an obligation without empathy. Since Jeff's trauma is valid, the writer might not be in the wrong for wanting to help their mom, but their method might have been flawed. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for making the demand. Since the writer's intention was good (helping mom), but didn't respect Jeff's boundaries, maybe it's a gray area. But according to AITA standards, if the writer forced Jeff to participate despite his valid reasons, they might be in the right if they had good intentions, but the answer could still be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their mother. However, some might argue that they should have been more considerate. Hmm. Need to decide based on the typical AITA responses. Often, people aren't in the wrong for trying to mediate, even if their approach isn't perfect. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
