Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad, who was abusive when Jeff was younger. The author's dad mellowed out after they were born, but Jeff left home early and hasn't been involved much. Now, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author went to talk to Jeff, urging him to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. They might think that family obligations require Jeff to help, especially since their mom is grieving. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons not wanting to participate due to the abuse he suffered. Is it fair to pressure someone to participate in a funeral if they have traumatic memories associated with the deceased?\n\nThe author's brother is dealing with past trauma. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's pain, since the dad was abusive towards Jeff but not towards them. The author is in a middle ground, trying to balance their mom's needs with their brother's feelings. But was it right to tell Jeff he has an obligation, especially when Jeff feels strongly about not helping?\n\nObligations in family matters can be complex. While some might argue that family should support each other even in difficult times, others might say that a person has the right to disengage if it causes them distress. The key here is whether the author had the right to impose this expectation on Jeff, given his history.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they might have overlooked Jeff's perspective. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the author was being considerate and tried to mediate between the mom and Jeff, maybe they're not wrong. But if they were pushing Jeff without considering his trauma, maybe they are.\n\nWait, the author said they told Jeff he has an obligation. That could be seen as pressuring him. Jeff's response was anger because he felt the author didn't understand his past. The author might not have wronged Jeff directly, but maybe they should have been more understanding and not framed it as an obligation. Instead of saying he must help, maybe they should have explained their mom's needs and let Jeff decide.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about respect for autonomy. Jeff's decision not to participate should be respected, even if the author disagrees. By telling Jeff he has an obligation, the author might be dismissing his feelings and trauma. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering Jeff's perspective and instead imposing their own view of family duty.\n\nAlternatively, the author is trying to support the mom, which is also valid. But the approach might have been wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were respectful of Jeff's autonomy. The author's intention was good, but the method might have been flawed. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's right to decline based on his experiences.\n"
