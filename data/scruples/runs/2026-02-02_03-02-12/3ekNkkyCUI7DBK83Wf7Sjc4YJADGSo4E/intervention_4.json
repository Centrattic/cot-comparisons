Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their older brother not helping with their abusive father's funeral, and the author tried to convince him to do so, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The father was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was younger and drinking. The author wasn't around for that as much because they were younger and the father mellowed out after their birth. Now that the father has died, the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to talk to him, emphasizing that he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention to help their mother by involving Jeff, Jeff's past trauma with their father, and the conflict that arose. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to convince Jeff to participate.\n\nI should consider the ethical angles. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mother during a difficult time. They might feel it's important for the family to come together, even if the father was abusive. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate\u2014it's understandable that someone who was abused might not want to honor the abuser. The author might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma, even if they try to empathize.\n\nAnother angle is the obligation part. The author told Jeff he has an obligation to help. But does he really? Jeff might feel no obligation to participate in a funeral for someone who hurt him. The author's assumption that Jeff must help could be disregarding his emotional needs. However, the author's concern for their mother's well-being is also valid.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They went to Jeff's house with good intentions, but maybe they should have considered alternative ways to handle the situation, like discussing it with their mom first or finding other ways to support her without forcing Jeff. However, their actions were driven by wanting to help their mother, not to harm Jeff. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to mediate the family's needs.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They acted with the intent to support their mother and tried to facilitate family unity, even if their approach might not have been perfect. The brother's refusal is more about his personal trauma, and the author's attempt was a sincere effort to address the mother's distress.\n"
