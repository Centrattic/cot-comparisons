Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, especially since the dad was abusive towards the brother.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, but mellowed out later. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back. Now, after the dad's death, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff refuses to help and calls the author out for not understanding his past.\n\nThe author's intent was to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. However, Jeff's refusal is based on his traumatic experiences. The author might think family obligations require participation, but Jeff's trauma could make that participation unbearable. The author didn't force Jeff, just tried to persuade him, which is reasonable. But they might not have considered the depth of Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs the author wrong? The key points are the author's good intentions, the mom's emotional state, and Jeff's justified resentment. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to mediate, but they might not have handled it perfectly. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies a moral failing. Since the author acted with the mom's well-being in mind and didn't coercive, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). Jeff's refusal is his right, and the author's attempt to bridge the gap isn't inherently wrong.\n"
