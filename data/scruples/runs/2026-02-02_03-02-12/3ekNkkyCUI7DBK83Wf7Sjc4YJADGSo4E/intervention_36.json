Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad relationship with their dad\u2014abuse, drinking, etc. The author, on the other hand, had a much better experience, especially after their birth when the dad mellowed out.\n\nSo, the author went to Jeff to convince him to help with the funeral because their mom is upset. Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help. The question is whether the author was wrong to approach Jeff that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. Jeff had a traumatic relationship with their dad. Abuse can have lasting effects, and it's understandable that Jeff might not want to participate in a funeral for someone who caused him so much pain. The author, having a different experience, might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma.\n\nBut the author's intention was to help their mom, who is grieving and upset. The author is caught between two sides: wanting to support their mom and understanding Jeff's perspective. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he has an obligation to help, which Jeff might see as dismissing his feelings of betrayal and anger.\n\nHowever, the author did go to Jeff in person, which is a respectful approach. They acknowledged Jeff's pain by saying they understand why he's upset. The problem might be in the framing of \"obligation.\" Jeff might feel forced into something he's not comfortable with, especially given his history.\n\nThe key here is whether the author respects Jeff's autonomy. Even with good intentions, pushing Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone he resents could be seen as invalidating his emotions. The author might not be wrong in trying to mediate, but the approach could have been more considerate. Instead of emphasizing obligation, perhaps focusing on their mom's needs while respecting Jeff's boundaries might have been better.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were good, but the method might have been flawed. However, the core issue is whether the author was wrong. Since the author tried to mediate and their main goal was to help their mom, it's not necessarily their fault. Jeff's refusal is his choice, and the author can't force him. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
