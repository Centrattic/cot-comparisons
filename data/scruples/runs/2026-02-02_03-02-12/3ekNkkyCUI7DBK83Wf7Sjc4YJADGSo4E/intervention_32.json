Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite the abuse.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when drunk. He mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18, hasn't looked back. The dad died, and Mom is upset because Jeff refuses to help with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to ask him to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry, said he won't help, and the author hasn't told Mom yet.\n\nSo, the main question is about the author's right to ask Jeff to help. The author's mom is hurt and needs support. The author is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. \n\nThe author approached Jeff with the intention of helping Mom, which is understandable. However, Jeff's refusal is based on his traumatic experiences. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings deeply enough before confronting him. Telling someone they \"have an obligation\" could come off as dismissive of their trauma. But the author's intention was to support Mom, which is also valid.\n\nIs the author wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help, but maybe they could have handled it differently, like understanding Jeff's perspective more before pushing for his involvement. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author's actions were from a place of concern for their mom, and Jeff's reaction was harsh, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. But there's room for both sides. The key is whether the author overstepped. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they were trying to support their family, even if the approach had flaws.\n"
