Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral, even though the dad was abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad was abusive to their older brother, Jeff, especially when he drank. The dad mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. The author didn't experience the same abuse as Jeff. Now the dad has died, and the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral arrangements, but Jeff refuses, saying he won't help because of the past abuse. The author told Jeff he needed to help for their mom's sake, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dad's history of abuse, Jeff's refusal to participate, the author's attempt to mediate, and the conflict that followed.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to support their mom by getting Jeff involved, but Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to the abuse. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma, as they weren't subjected to the same treatment. Telling Jeff he has an obligation could be seen as ignoring his feelings and the reasons he has for not participating. \n\nObligations in family matters can be complex, especially with unresolved trauma. The author might think it's about family duty, but Jeff's stance is justified given the past. The author's approach might have been too direct without considering Jeff's perspective. However, the author was trying to help their mom, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn terms of ethics, pushing someone to participate in a funeral when they have a history of abuse could be seen as insensitive. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but they might have mishandled the situation by not respecting Jeff's boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author's intention was to help their mom, but the approach could be questioned. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions disregarded Jeff's valid reasons, then maybe A (Yes). But considering the context, the author might not be entirely at fault. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit. The author's actions were based on wanting to support their mom, which is understandable, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma enough. \n\nFinal judgment: The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they could have approached it differently. So answer B.\n"
