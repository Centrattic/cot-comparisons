Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the older brother, Jeff, should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. The author, the younger sibling, went to Jeff's place and told him he has an obligation to help, which led to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drunk, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back, which makes sense given the environment. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author tried to mediate.\n\nThe key points here are obligation to family, especially in death, and the emotional impact on the mother. The author's intention was to support the mother, which is understandable. But Jeff is refusing because of the past abuse. The author might be in a tough spot between supporting the mother and respecting Jeff's feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong for urging Jeff to help? Well, the author believed it's for Mom's sake. But Jeff has valid reasons not to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The author might not have considered that Jeff's trauma could be so severe that he can't even attend. Telling Jeff he has an obligation could be seen as dismissing his past pain.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were to help the mother. But maybe the approach was wrong. Instead of demanding, maybe a more empathetic approach would be better. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his right to refuse participating in a funeral for someone who was harmful to him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't personally at fault for trying to help their mother. But they might have overstepped by implying Jeff was obligated, not considering his trauma. So, the answer could be A (yes) because they didn't respect Jeff's feelings, but also B (no) because they were trying to help Mom. It's a bit of a gray area. The community often considers the emotional impact and the right to personal boundaries. Since Jeff has a valid reason to not participate, the author might have been wrong to pressure him.\n"
