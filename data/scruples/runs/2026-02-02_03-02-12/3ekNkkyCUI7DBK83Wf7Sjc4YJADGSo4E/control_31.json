Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother to help with their dad's funeral. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user's dad was abusive towards their older brother, Jeff, especially when he drank. The dad mellowed out after the author was born and got sober. Now the dad has died, and the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral to support their mom, but Jeff refuses. The author confronted Jeff, who got angry and refused to help. The author is asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects here. Jeff had a terrible childhood because of their dad, which explains his reluctance. The author, who had a better relationship with the dad, is asking Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him. Is it reasonable to expect someone to help with the funeral of someone who was abusive to them? The author's intention is to support their mom, which is understandable. However, they might not fully appreciate the emotional trauma Jeff experienced.\n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author is caught between their mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger. But is the author wrong for trying to mediate? Or is Jeff's refusal completely valid given his past?\n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often have the right to set boundaries, especially after enduring abuse. Forcing someone to participate in a ceremony for an abuser can be retraumatizing. The author might not have considered the depth of Jeff's trauma. Instead of telling Jeff he \"needs\" to contribute, maybe a more compassionate approach would be better. However, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is also valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be, because they were trying to help their mom, but they could have approached it differently. However, the answer depends on whether they had the right to pressure Jeff. Since Jeff's refusal is based on valid reasons, the author might be in the right to try to reconcile, but maybe overstepped by telling him it's an obligation. The key is whether the author respected Jeff's boundaries. The author might have good intentions but didn't account for Jeff's trauma. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex. However, some might argue the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision. Hmm, tricky.\n"

  "answer": "B",
  "full_response": "B\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for trying to support their mother by encouraging Jeff to participate in the funeral planning, especially given the mother's distress. However, the situation is nuanced. While the author's intentions were to mediate and help their mom, they may not have fully considered the depth of Jeff's trauma from their father's abuse. Jeff's refusal is valid given his history, and the author might have approached the conversation with less pressure and more empathy. That said, the author's act of intervention itself isn't inherently wrong\u2014they were attempting to address a family conflict in a challenging context.",
