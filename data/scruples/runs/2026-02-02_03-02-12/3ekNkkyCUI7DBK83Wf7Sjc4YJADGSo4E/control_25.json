Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author was born later, and the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Now the dad died, and the author and mom want Jeff to help with the funeral because he's not participating, which is making mom upset. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry, called him an idiot, and refused to help. The author is now feeling caught between mom and Jeff.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, to decide, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting the brother involved. But Jeff had a valid reason not to help because of the abuse. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. However, the author was trying to support their mom's emotional needs. \n\nIs it the author's fault for trying to mediate? Well, the author was acting in good faith to help their mom. But maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. However, the author wasn't the one causing the issue; Jeff's refusal is the problem. The author didn't force Jeff, just tried to reason. Jeff had the final say. \n\nIn terms of obligation, family obligations can be complex. If Jeff doesn't want to participate because of the abuse, it's his choice. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to reach out, even if Jeff didn't respond well. The author's action was to help their mom, which is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (no), the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to bridge a gap between mom and Jeff, even though Jeff had his own reasons. The author's mistake, if any, was maybe not understanding Jeff's trauma enough, but they weren't the one being abusive here. Jeff was the one who was abusive in his response. So the author isn't at fault.\n"
