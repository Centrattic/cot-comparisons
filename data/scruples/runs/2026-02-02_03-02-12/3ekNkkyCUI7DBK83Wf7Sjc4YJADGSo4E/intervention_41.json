Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he must help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves abuse by their father, which primarily affected the brother, while the author wasn't as affected. The brother cut ties after moving out, and now the author is caught between supporting their mom and respecting their brother's choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father was abusive to the brother, which is a serious matter. The brother has a valid reason not to want to participate in the funeral, given the trauma. The author, however, feels responsible to convince the brother to help for their mom's sake. The author didn't force the brother but tried to appeal to his sense of duty.\n\nThe key points are the brother's right to disengage from the funeral due to his history with the father, and the author's attempt to reconcile family dynamics. The author didn't accuse the brother of being wrong or force him; they just tried to persuade him out of respect for their mom. The brother's reaction was hostile, but that's his choice. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force the brother to do anything. They communicated the mom's feelings and asked the brother to consider helping, which is a reasonable request. The brother's refusal is his own decision. The author's action was to mediate a family matter, which is a common role in families. Even though the author might not fully understand the brother's trauma, their intention wasn't malicious.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They tried to bridge a gap without coercion, respecting the brother's autonomy while considering the mother's needs.\n"
