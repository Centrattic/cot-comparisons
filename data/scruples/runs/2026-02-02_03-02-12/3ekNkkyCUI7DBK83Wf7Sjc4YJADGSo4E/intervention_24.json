Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother to help with the funeral of their abusive dad. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't been in touch much. Now the dad died, and Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, making their mom upset. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author's position is that Jeff should help Mom by contributing to the funeral. Jeff feels the dad was an asshole and doesn't want to participate because of his past abuse. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff shut down.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know the answer.\n\nI need to consider ethics here. Is there an obligation to attend or help with a family member's funeral? In some cultures, yes, but in others, people might choose not to participate, especially if the deceased was abusive. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, but Jeff has valid reasons from his traumatic experiences.\n\nThe author's intention was to support the mom by trying to get Jeff involved. However, maybe the author didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. But was the author wrong to suggest it? Maybe not in the sense of trying to help the mom, but the approach might have been insensitive.\n\nBut the key is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't force Jeff, just tried to talk to him. Jeff's refusal is his own choice. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical. They were trying to reconcile the family's feelings. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
