Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad\u2014he was abusive, drunk, and violent when Jeff was younger. The author, the younger sibling, didn't experience that abuse because the dad mellowed out after the author was born. Now the dad is dead, and the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him he needs to help for Mom's sake, and Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff that. Let's break it down. The author's reasoning was to help Mom, who's upset both by the dad's death and Jeff not helping. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff reacted negatively, citing past trauma.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to impose the obligation on Jeff? Is it the author's place to mediate this? The dad was abusive towards Jeff, so Jeff's refusal might be justified based on his experience. However, the author might think it's important for family unity or to support their mom.\n\nBut here's the thing: The author isn't in a position to make Jeff feel guilty for not wanting to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's trauma. Also, the author's approach could have been more empathetic. Instead of telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" maybe acknowledging Jeff's feelings and trying to find another way to support Mom would be better. The author's intervention might have caused more harm by making Jeff feel pressured and dismissed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to help their mom, which is understandable. But they might not have considered Jeff's perspective adequately. The answer depends on whether the obligation is valid. In cases of abuse, it's not a given that family members must participate in funerals. So the author's assumption that Jeff has an obligation might be wrong. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and for pushing without understanding his reasons.\n"
