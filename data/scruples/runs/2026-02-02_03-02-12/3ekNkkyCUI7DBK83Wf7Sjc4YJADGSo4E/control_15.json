Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he has to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, especially when drunk. The author was born later, and the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad died, and the mom and author are handling the funeral. Jeff is refusing to help, which upsets the mom. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused, saying he won't help. The author is now caught between mom and Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points: The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a valid reason for Jeff to not want to participate. The author tried to convince Jeff out of sympathy for the mom. The question is if the author was wrong to do that.\n\nLegally and ethically, family members aren't obligated to help with funerals. The author might have felt they were helping their mom, but Jeff's trauma is valid. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral for an abusive parent could be retraumatizing. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings and reasons. So the author's intention was to help mom, but they didn't respect Jeff's autonomy and his right to disengage from the abusive parent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for assuming Jeff had an obligation when Jeff clearly has emotional reasons not to help.\n"
