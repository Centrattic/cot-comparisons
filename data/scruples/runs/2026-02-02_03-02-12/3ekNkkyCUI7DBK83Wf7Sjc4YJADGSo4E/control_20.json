Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive when the brother was young, but mellowed out later. The brother left home early, probably to escape the abuse. Now, the dad died, and the mom is upset because the brother isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to the brother, telling him he should help for mom's sake. The brother got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to push their brother in this situation. \n\nFrom the brother's perspective, he has a lot of trauma. The dad was abusive, so attending the funeral might be emotionally difficult. The brother might not want to participate because of the negative memories, even if the dad improved later. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is grieving and wants closure. The author is trying to help mom by encouraging the brother. But maybe the author didn't consider that the brother's refusal is a valid emotional response. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to impose their will on the brother. The brother isn't a child anymore, so he has the right to decide his involvement. The author's intention was to help mom, but maybe they didn't respect the brother's boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author's approach might have been confrontational. Telling someone they \"need to contribute\" could come off as judgmental, especially if they've been hurt. The brother's anger is a reaction to that pressure, given his past experiences.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not understanding the brother's emotional state and not approaching the situation with more empathy. Instead of demanding help, maybe the family should have been more supportive of the brother's choice, even if it's not what they wanted. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't entirely wrong, but perhaps their method could have been better. However, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the brother has the right to refuse, and the author didn't consider that, maybe the answer is B, but there's nuance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author tried to help mom, but maybe they should have respected the brother's wishes instead of pushing. So, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was good, but the approach could have been better. However, some might argue that the author was wrong to pressure the brother. The key point is the brother's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but the brother's right to say no is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
