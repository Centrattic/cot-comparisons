Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral for their abusive dad. The situation is a bit complicated with family dynamics and past abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The older brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad when he was younger. He moved out as soon as he could, and the dad became less abusive after the author was born. Now the dad has died, and the author's mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he has an obligation to help, which led to Jeff getting angry and refusing to help.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to do that. The author is caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's trauma. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might have good intentions, wanting to support their mom during a tough time. However, they might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be retraumatizing. The author's message that Jeff \"has an obligation\" might come off as dismissive of his past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff, showing concern for both. But the way they approached it might not have been empathetic enough. Instead of framing it as an obligation, maybe a more compassionate approach, acknowledging Jeff's pain and asking for his input, could have been better.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's approach was right or wrong. Since the author intended to help their mom but perhaps didn't consider Jeff's feelings adequately, it's a gray area. However, the core issue is whether the author was wrong. The answer here would likely be B (No), because the author's intentions were good, but they could have handled it differently. But wait, maybe the obligation part is the problem. The author might have been wrong to impose an obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. So maybe A (Yes). Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's answer options are A for Yes (author in the wrong) and B for No. The key is whether the author was wrong. The author told Jeff he must help for mom's sake. Given that Jeff had valid reasons to refuse, the author might not be wrong, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the author's action was inappropriate due to not respecting Jeff's decision (based on his trauma), then A. If the action was well-meaning but not wrong, then B.\n\nIn many cases, people argue that you can't force someone to participate in a funeral if it's traumatic. The author's brother has the right to decline. So the author might be in the wrong for pressuring Jeff. Therefore, the answer would be A. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because they were trying to help their mom. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural expectations. However, in terms of ethical considerations, forcing someone to do something they find hurtful could be wrong. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. So answer A.\n"
