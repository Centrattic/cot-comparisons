Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their brother he has to help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad died, and Mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place and told him he needs to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author's intention was to help their mom, who's distressed. They felt caught between their brother's justified anger and their mom's need. But did they overstep?\n\nFamily obligations can be complex, especially after abuse. Jeff has valid reasons not to want to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him. The author, however, tried to convince Jeff to help, perhaps without considering Jeff's feelings enough. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to support their mom, but maybe they should have respected Jeff's decision not to get involved. The author might not have the right to pressure Jeff into doing something that's emotionally difficult for him. On the other hand, the author might feel they were just trying to make things easier for their mom. \n\nBut given that the father was abusive, Jeff's refusal isn't unreasonable. The author's approach might have been too prescriptive, not acknowledging Jeff's right to distance himself. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his justified feelings towards the father. However, if the family expects everyone to participate regardless of past issues, maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nBut in cases of abuse, it's often considered okay for a person to cut ties or refuse to participate in honoring the abuser. The author might have been out of line by telling Jeff he has an obligation, which implies that Jeff must participate despite his feelings. So the author's statement that Jeff \"has an obligation\" might be the key point. If the author forced that obligation without considering Jeff's trauma, then they are in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
