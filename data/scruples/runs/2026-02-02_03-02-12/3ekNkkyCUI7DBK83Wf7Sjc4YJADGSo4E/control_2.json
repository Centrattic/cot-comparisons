Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when he was drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home when he was 18, and hasn't been in contact much. The dad died, and now the author and mom are trying to plan the funeral, but Jeff refuses to help. The mom asked the author to talk to Jeff, who then got angry and refused. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong for telling Jeff he had an obligation to help.\n\nSo the main points here are about obligation. The author believes Jeff has an obligation to help, but Jeff feels he doesn't because of the past abuse. The author took it upon themselves to confront Jeff, which led to conflict.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. First, family obligations. Is there an expectation that family members must help with a parent's funeral regardless of past issues? In many cultures, there is a sense of duty, but that can conflict with personal feelings, especially if there's a history of abuse. Jeff's refusal could be justified from his perspective because of the trauma he experienced. On the other hand, the author wanted to support their mom, who is upset that Jeff isn't helping. The author's intention was to mediate the situation, perhaps to ease their mom's distress.\n\nThe author's approach might be seen as overstepping because they assumed Jeff had an obligation without considering his feelings. However, the author's motivation was to help their mom, which is understandable. The key issue is whether the author had the right to impose that obligation on Jeff, especially given the history.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might not fully understand Jeff's perspective. The author was younger when the dad improved, so maybe they don't grasp the extent of Jeff's suffering. The author's message to Jeff was that he should put aside his feelings for the mom, which Jeff resented. That could be seen as dismissive of Jeff's valid emotions.\n\nAlso, the author didn't confront Jeff about the funeral itself but about helping Mom. Jeff's refusal is about the deceased, but the author's focus was on the mom's feelings. Maybe the author should have considered that Jeff might not be ready to engage with the funeral process, regardless of Mom's feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was good, but the approach might have been flawed. They might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but perhaps in how they framed the obligation. Alternatively, Jeff's right to refuse due to his history with their father could mean the author was wrong to insist on the obligation.\n\nI need to balance the cultural expectation of family duty against individual trauma. There's no clear right or wrong, but the author's action might be seen as not respecting Jeff's boundaries given his past. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were acting out of concern for their mom, but others might argue they were wrong (A) for not respecting Jeff's feelings.\n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's statement that Jeff has an obligation is the key point. If Jeff's refusal is justified due to his history, then the author might be in the wrong for expecting help. However, if the author believed it was necessary for Mom's sake, it's a gray area. \n\nThe final decision hinges on whether imposing a family obligation overrides past abuse. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help their mom, even if the approach was not perfect. But some might say A. However, the community often sides with people trying to support a parent, so maybe B.\n"
