Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a family conflict about a funeral. The author, let's call them Person A, is trying to get their older brother Jeff to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to Jeff but mellowed out after Person A was born. Jeff doesn't want to help, and Person A tried to convince him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a serious issue. Jeff moved out early and hasn't been in touch much. Now, with the dad's death, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. Person A went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The question is whether Person A is at fault for urging Jeff to help despite his past.\n\nThe core of the issue is whether Jeff has an obligation to help. Obligations can be subjective here. On one hand, the family might feel he should contribute for the mom's sake. On the other, Jeff has valid reasons not to participate due to past abuse. Person A's intention was to help Mom, but they didn't consider Jeff's trauma as much as they could have.\n\nIs Person A wrong for pushing Jeff? Well, they might not be in the wrong because they're trying to support their mom. However, they might not fully grasp Jeff's perspective. The question is about obligation. The author assumed Jeff should help, but Jeff has a history of abuse. The answer might hinge on whether the author overstepped by implying obligation without understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nIn AITA situations, the key is often empathy and understanding. If Person A had tried to mediate or find another way to support Mom without forcing Jeff, maybe they'd be less in the wrong. But Jeff's refusal is also valid given his history. So, the author isn't entirely wrong because they're trying to help their mom, but maybe they could have approached it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author's actions were to support their mother and they didn't force Jeff physically, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're not the one being abusive; Jeff's the one refusing help. Alternatively, perhaps the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because they're advocating for their mom's emotional needs. They tried to mediate and got a negative reaction. Jeff's refusal is his choice, and the author isn't forcing him. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're not the one refusing. The obligation isn't legally enforceable, so it's more about family expectations. The author's role is to try to reconcile, which is understandable. Jeff's response is extreme, but the author isn't wrong for trying to help mom.\n"
