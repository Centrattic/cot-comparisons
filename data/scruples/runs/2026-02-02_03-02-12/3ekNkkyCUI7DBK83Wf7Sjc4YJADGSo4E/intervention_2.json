Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the narrator) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the narrator was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved much since. Now the father has died, and the mother is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator tried to convince Jeff to help, but Jeff refused, calling the narrator an idiot and refusing any involvement. The narrator is now conflicted between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's trauma.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The father was abusive, especially to Jeff. 2) The narrator believes Jeff should help the mom for her sake. 3) Jeff is unwilling due to past trauma. 4) The narrator confronted Jeff about it.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, family obligations can be complex. While there's a cultural expectation to support family in times of need, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The narrator's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable, but they might not have fully considered Jeff's emotional state.\n\nThe father's abuse was real and had a lasting impact on Jeff. The narrator, who wasn't subjected to the same abuse, might not fully grasp Jeff's feelings. By telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" the narrator might be imposing their own expectations without empathy for Jeff's trauma. Obligations can be subjective, especially when there's a history of abuse. Jeff's refusal is a personal choice based on his painful experiences.\n\nThe narrator's approach might have been well-meaning, but it could have been more empathetic. Instead of framing it as an obligation, they might have tried to understand Jeff's perspective better before pushing for his help. However, the narrator isn't entirely wrong because they were trying to support their mom. The conflict here is between family duty and personal trauma.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not a clear-cut yes or no. But given the context, the narrator isn't in the wrong because they had good intentions. However, they could have handled the situation more sensitively. So the answer is B.\n"
