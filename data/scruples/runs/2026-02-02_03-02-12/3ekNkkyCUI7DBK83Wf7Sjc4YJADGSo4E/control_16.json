Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has to help with their dad's funeral. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive, especially when drunk, towards the older brother Jeff. The author wasn't around for that as much because he was younger and the dad mellowed out after he was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now worried if they were right to push Jeff.\n\nSo, the main points: Jeff has valid reasons to be upset and not want to help. The author tried to get Jeff to help for their mom's sake. But Jeff is in his right to decline because of the past abuse. The author might be in the right because they're trying to support their mom, but they might also be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's feelings.\n\nWait, but is the author obligated to make Jeff help? The author's role here is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff. However, Jeff's refusal is understandable given the history. The author might not be in the wrong because they were following their mom's request, but maybe they should have considered Jeff's perspective more. However, the author also acknowledges Jeff's reasons. So the answer isn't clear-cut. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to help the mom, but the method might have been wrong. They told Jeff he has an obligation, which Jeff might feel is invalid given the abuse. So maybe the author is in the wrong for imposing that obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. Alternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. But the community often sides with the person who is respecting the other's feelings. In AITA threads, pushing someone to help when they have valid reasons to refuse can make you the \"not in the wrong\" person if you're advocating for a parent, but sometimes the other side is considered. Hmm. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom and didn't know the full extent of Jeff's issues. But maybe A because they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. Wait, the author does acknowledge Jeff's reasons. So maybe B.\n"
