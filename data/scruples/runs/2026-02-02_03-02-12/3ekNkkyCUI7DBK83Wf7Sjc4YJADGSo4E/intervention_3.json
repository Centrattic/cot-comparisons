Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: The father was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born, but Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now, after the father's death, the mother is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are about obligation, forgiveness, and family dynamics. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff to participate, but Jeff feels justified in not helping due to past abuse. \n\nObligation to family can be a tricky subject. In many cultures, there's an expectation that siblings help with each other's families, especially in times of need like funerals. However, if there's a history of abuse, some might argue that the obligation isn't there. The author is trying to mediate between their mom's emotional needs and Jeff's justified anger. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as overstepping if Jeff wasn't given a choice in the matter. But considering the mom's well-being and the fact that the author is trying to find a middle ground, it's a complex situation. The author might not be in the wrong because they were attempting to reconcile family tensions. Jeff's response was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make the author at fault for trying to reach out. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have let Jeff decide without pressure. But given the mom's distress, the author felt compelled to act. It's a balance between respecting Jeff's boundaries and supporting their mother. The author's intent was good, but the method might have been flawed. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since Jeff has valid reasons for not participating, the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to encourage him, even if it didn't work out. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
