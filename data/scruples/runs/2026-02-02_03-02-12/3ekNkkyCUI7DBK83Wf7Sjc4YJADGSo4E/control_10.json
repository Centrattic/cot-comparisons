Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite the abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, got sober after the author was born, and became less abusive. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Let's break it down. \n\nOn one side, the author is trying to support their mom during a difficult time. They might feel that family should come together, even if the dad wasn't perfect. The author's argument is about Mom's emotional needs, which is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, Jeff has a history of abuse. He might not want to honor a father who was abusive. The author acknowledges that Jeff has reasons to be upset. Forcing him to participate could be seen as ignoring his trauma. The author might not fully understand Jeff's feelings, especially since they weren't around the abuse as much.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they tried to mediate, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. However, their intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. The key points here are about respect for Jeff's boundaries and the mom's needs. \n\nThe author didn't force Jeff, just asked him to help. But Jeff's refusal is his right, given his history. The author might have thought they were being kind to Mom, but maybe they should have respected Jeff's decision more. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to bridge the gap. It's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma enough. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and there's no clear right answer. Since the options are A or B, and the author's actions were with good intentions, maybe the answer is B (No), because they weren't wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
