Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, which Jeff clearly remembers. The author wasn't around during most of that abuse, or maybe the dad mellowed out when the author was born, so they didn't experience the same treatment. Now, the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him to help, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they were in the wrong by approaching Jeff that way. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The key points are the obligation to help with the funeral, the history of abuse, and the author's intentions. The author's mom is distressed, so the author is trying to help her by getting Jeff involved. Jeff, on the other hand, has a valid reason to be upset because of his past with their dad. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting Jeff to contribute? Well, families often have complex dynamics. Even though Jeff was abused, maybe the author believes there's a duty to help the family, especially the mom. But Jeff's trauma might make it hard for him to participate, especially honoring the person who abused him. \n\nThe author's approach was to tell Jeff he has an obligation. That might come off as dismissive of Jeff's feelings. Maybe instead of saying \"you have an obligation,\" they should have tried to understand Jeff's perspective better. However, the author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're trying to help their mom. On the other, they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and history. But the question is whether they were in the wrong, not necessarily if their approach was the best. \n\nSince Jeff has a valid reason for not wanting to participate, the author might be assuming that Jeff should let go of the past for the mom's sake. However, family obligations can be tricky, and Jeff's refusal isn't unreasonable given his history. The author's message might have been perceived as pressuring Jeff to reconcile with a traumatic past, which isn't fair. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but their approach might have been insensitive. The answer here is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author had good intentions and the situation is complicated by their father's abuse. However, maybe the author should have considered Jeff's trauma more, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. It's more about the complexity of family roles and past trauma.\n"
