Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The dad was abusive towards the older brother, Jeff, when he was younger. After the younger sibling was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. The mom stayed with the dad despite the abuse. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo the author is asking if they're at fault for telling Jeff he should help. The key points here are the history of abuse, the author's understanding of Jeff's anger, and the author's attempt to support their mom by trying to get Jeff involved.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to help their mom by involving Jeff, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, Jeff has a legitimate reason not to help due to past abuse. The author might not be wrong for trying to mediate, especially since they understand Jeff's perspective. However, maybe they shouldn't have forced Jeff to participate in something he's not comfortable with. The question is whether the author overstepped by asserting that Jeff \"needs\" to help, given the history.\n\nAnother angle: family obligations can be complex, especially after abuse. It's possible that the author didn't consider that Jeff's refusal is a healthy boundary. The author might have acted out of loyalty to Mom but didn't respect Jeff's trauma. So, while the intention was good, the approach might be flawed.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if their actions were inappropriate. Since they tried to persuade Jeff and didn't force him, but Jeff had valid reasons, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They were trying to be a good sibling to both. However, maybe they should have been more respectful of Jeff's decision without pushing, but the story doesn't show coercion beyond persuasion. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they acted with good intentions and the obligation aspect is debatable. The author's role is to support Mom while understanding Jeff's stance, so there's no clear fault here.\n"
