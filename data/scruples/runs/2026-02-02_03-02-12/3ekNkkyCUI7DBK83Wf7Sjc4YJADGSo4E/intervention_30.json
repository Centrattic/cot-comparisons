Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: the dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when drunk. He mellowed out after the author was born, but Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved. Now, after the dad's death, their mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, and the author hasn't told mom yet.\n\nThe key points to consider are the dynamics between the siblings and their dad. Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad, so his refusal to help might be justified from his perspective. The author, on the other hand, had a better relationship, maybe because the dad was sober and mellow when they were born. \n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom by trying to get Jeff involved. But Jeff's reaction was defensive, which makes sense given his past. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider Jeff's feelings or history enough. However, the author was trying to mediate a family situation where their mom is hurting, which is also valid.\n\nThe obligation part is tricky. Does Jeff have a moral obligation to help? If the author assumes that everyone must help regardless of past trauma, maybe they're being insensitive. But if they're trying to support their mom's emotional needs, they might see it as a family duty. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't force Jeff, just tried to reason. Jeff's response was harsh, but the author's approach might have been a bit pushy. However, given the mom's distress, the author's actions might be seen as trying to do the right thing. \n\nI think the answer is more on the side of B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help their mom and didn't force Jeff. But there's a gray area. The author could have approached it more sensitively, but their intention was to support the family. So the answer is B.\n"
