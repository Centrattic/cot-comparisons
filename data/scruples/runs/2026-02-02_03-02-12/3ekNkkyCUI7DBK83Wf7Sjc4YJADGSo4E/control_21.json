Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad when he was younger. The author, the younger sibling, wasn't around during the worst of it. The dad became sober after the author was born and mellowed out. Now, the dad died, and Jeff refuses to help with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the mother's emotional state, and the author's actions. The author feels caught between Jeff's justified anger and Mom's need for support. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to mediate a family conflict. They approached Jeff to help the mom, which is a valid concern. However, they might not have considered Jeff's feelings deeply enough. But given that the author was trying to support their mom and didn't know all the details, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. \n\nJeff's refusal is understandable because of past trauma. The author's approach might have been too direct, but their intent was to help a parent. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since the author didn't force Jeff and tried to explain the mother's feelings, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to help a parent and didn't anticipate Jeff's trauma. They might have handled it differently, but they aren't wrong.\n"
