Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but became less so after the narrator was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now the dad died, and the mom and narrator are handling the funeral, but Jeff is refusing to help. The narrator went to Jeff to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff refuses and calls the narrator an idiot. The narrator is now caught between their mom and Jeff, wondering if they were wrong to push Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jeff's history of abuse, the narrator's lack of direct experience with that abuse, the mom's emotional state, and the narrator's attempt to mediate by telling Jeff he has an obligation.\n\nThe user wants to know if the narrator is in the wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nFrom what I see, the narrator's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. However, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate given the abuse. The narrator might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through. By framing it as an \"obligation,\" the narrator could be disregarding Jeff's feelings and boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the narrator was trying to support their mom, which is understandable. The question is whether the approach was wrong. The narrator might not be in the wrong entirely because they were trying to help, but maybe they should have approached Jeff more sensitively, considering his past. However, the key is whether they had the right to tell Jeff he has an obligation. Since Jeff isn't legally or morally bound to help if he's a victim, the narrator might be in the wrong for pressuring him. \n\nAlternatively, maybe family obligations are cultural or expected, but if Jeff has trauma, that's a personal decision. The narrator's approach might have been thoughtless. So the answer might be A, yes, the narrator is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's perspective and boundaries.\n"
