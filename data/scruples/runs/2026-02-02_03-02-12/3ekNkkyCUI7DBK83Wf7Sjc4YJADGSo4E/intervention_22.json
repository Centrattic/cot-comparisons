Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about family dynamics after the death of their dad. The author's brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad when he was younger. The dad got sober after the author was born, and things improved. Now that the dad is deceased, the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff refuses, causing a rift.\n\nSo, the author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help their mom, arguing that Jeff should contribute for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, saying the author doesn't understand what he went through and refuses to help. The author is now torn between supporting Mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong in telling Jeff he should help. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is a valid concern. They might feel responsible to bridge the gap between Jeff and Mom. But Jeff has legitimate reasons not to want to participate in the funeral due to past trauma. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a result of deep emotional wounds. \n\nIs it right to pressure someone, especially a family member, to participate in a funeral after such abuse? The author's approach might have been forceful, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which could feel like dismissing Jeff's pain. Maybe the author should have approached it with more empathy, understanding Jeff's perspective first before pushing for action.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to support their mom, who is upset. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is a coping mechanism rather than mere stubbornness. The key here is whether the author overstepped by implying Jeff has an obligation, instead of respecting his choice to distance himself from their dad's memory.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was good but the method might have been wrong. Telling Jeff he must help could be seen as invalidating his experiences. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have respected Jeff's decision without trying to force participation.\n"
