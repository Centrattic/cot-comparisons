Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that the dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. The author, being the younger sibling, now feels that Jeff should help with the funeral to support their mom. But Jeff is refusing because of his past with their dad.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. They went to Jeff's place and asked him to contribute. Jeff's reaction was hostile, but the author's approach might have been confrontational. The key points here are the dynamics of family obligations and past trauma. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, family expectations can be complex. On one hand, after a parent's death, it's common for siblings to share responsibilities. But Jeff has a history of abuse, which is a significant factor. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma, which could make their demand seem insensitive. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation is to support their mom, which is a valid concern. They might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is rooted in genuine emotional pain. The approach of directly telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might have been too forceful, not taking into account his feelings. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to help their mom, but maybe the method could have been more empathetic. The answer hinges on balancing family duty with past trauma. The author's actions stem from a place of caring for their mom, even if they didn't fully consider Jeff's perspective. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that their approach could have been more understanding.\n"
