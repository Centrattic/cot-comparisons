Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're at fault for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't around for most of that because he was born later, and the dad mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out when he was 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now, after the dad died, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral planning. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help, which led to an argument where Jeff got angry and refused to help.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They wanted to help their mom by getting Jeff involved, maybe thinking it's important for the family to come together, especially since Jeff had a hard past with dad. The author acknowledges that Jeff has reasons not to help, but still tried to convince him because of their mom's feelings. \n\nOn the other side, Jeff's perspective: He endured abuse from their dad, which might make it hard for him to even think about participating in a funeral for someone who was so cruel. The author's approach might have been seen as pressuring Jeff to do something he's not emotionally ready for. The author might have assumed obligation without considering Jeff's trauma.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to reconcile the family, but maybe they should have approached it differently. The key points are about obligation and understanding. Does someone have an obligation to attend a funeral if they were abused by the deceased? It's a family matter, but personal feelings and trauma can affect that. The author's intention was for the mom's sake, but Jeff's refusal is valid given his history. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but perhaps they could have been more sensitive. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for telling Jeff he should help. Since Jeff was abusive, the author might feel it's fair to ask for support for their mom. But Jeff's right to say no can't be ignored. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were respectful and understanding of Jeff's reasons. \n\nThe author did acknowledge Jeff's trauma and tried to explain it's for Mom's sake, but Jeff still refused. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help their mom, even if Jeff's response was negative. So the answer is B.\n"
