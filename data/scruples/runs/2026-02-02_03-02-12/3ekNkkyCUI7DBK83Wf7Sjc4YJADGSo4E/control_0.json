Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he needs to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father, and Jeff had a really bad experience with him when he was younger. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author tried to convince Jeff to contribute. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. Jeff left home when he was 18 and hasn't been back. Now that the dad is dead, the author and mom are handling the funeral, but Jeff refuses to help. The author went to Jeff's house to talk to him, and Jeff reacted angrily. The author is now torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's reasons.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author tried to mediate and support their mom's emotional needs. They didn't force Jeff, but asked him to help for Mom's sake. However, Jeff has valid reasons not to want to participate in the funeral of someone who was abusive. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, but they were trying to be considerate of both parties.\n\nBut wait, does the author have the right to push Jeff to take part in something he's not emotionally ready for? Maybe not. However, given that the author's intention was to help their mom, and Jeff's refusal is based on past abuse, it's a gray area. The author might have been in a difficult position, trying to balance their mom's feelings with Jeff's justified anger.\n\nLooking at the details: the author mentioned that after their birth, the dad mellowed out, but Jeff had a different experience. The author was only 13 when Jeff left, so maybe they didn't fully understand Jeff's trauma. The author tried to approach Jeff calmly, but Jeff was defensive. The author didn't force Jeff, just tried to mediate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were well-intentioned. They were trying to support their mom, which is understandable. But they might not have considered Jeff's perspective enough. However, since Jeff's refusal is based on valid trauma, the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to reach out. The key here is that the author didn't impose but rather asked Jeff to help for Mom's sake. Jeff's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions were in good faith. So, probably the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
