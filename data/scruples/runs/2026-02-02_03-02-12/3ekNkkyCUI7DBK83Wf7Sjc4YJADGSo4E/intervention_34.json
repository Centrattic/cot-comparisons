Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother that he has an obligation to help with their father's funeral. The father was abusive towards the brother, but not the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father was abusive when the brother was younger, but became better after the author was born. The brother left home early and hasn't been back. Now the father died, and the mother is upset because the brother isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince the brother, who reacted angrily, saying he won't help. The author is torn between supporting the mother and understanding the brother's pain.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's justification for refusing and the author's motivation. The brother has valid reasons due to past abuse. The author's intention was to help the mother, which is understandable. But is the author wrong for expecting their brother to help despite his trauma?\n\nIn such cases, it's about empathy and respect for personal boundaries. The author might not realize how deep the brother's hurt is. However, the author's action was well-intentioned, trying to mediate family conflict. But pushing someone to participate in something they're not emotionally ready for can be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the brother's refusal doesn't make the author wrong for trying to reach out. The author might not be in the wrong because their intention was to support their mother, but maybe they should have been more sensitive to the brother's feelings. The answer hinges on whether the obligation is moral. Family obligations can be subjective, especially in cases of abuse.\n\nSo, the author's action is not necessarily wrong, but there's room for understanding the brother's stance. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
