Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to the brother, Jeff, but then mellowed out when the author was born. The author thinks Jeff should help with the funeral because their mom is upset he's not involved. Jeff refuses, saying he doesn't want to help because of the abuse. The author went to talk to Jeff about it and got yelled at.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a serious issue. Abuse can have lasting effects, and it's possible Jeff has trauma from that. If Jeff doesn't want to participate in the funeral because of the negative memories, maybe that's understandable. The author, on the other hand, is trying to mediate for their mom's sake. The mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping, so the author feels caught between the two.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for telling Jeff he should help. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is valid. However, they might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. Did the author have the right to tell Jeff he has an obligation? Maybe the author didn't consider that Jeff might not feel responsible, especially since he left home early and hasn't been involved. Also, the author might not have the authority to make Jeff do something. \n\nBut on the other hand, families often have responsibilities to each other, even if there's conflict. The author might think it's about supporting mom, who is grieving. However, Jeff's refusal could be a boundary, and the author might have overstepped by pressing him. It's a balance between respecting Jeff's feelings and trying to help mom. The author's approach might have been too direct without understanding Jeff's perspective fully.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's good intention vs. respecting Jeff's trauma and boundaries. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but maybe they could have approached it differently. However, if the author didn't consider Jeff's valid reasons, that could be an issue. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since Jeff's reasons are valid, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that. But maybe not, because family obligations can be complex. Hmm, tricky.\n"
