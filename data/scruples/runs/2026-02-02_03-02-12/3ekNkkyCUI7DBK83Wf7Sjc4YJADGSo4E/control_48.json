Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the dad was abusive when the brother was young but mellowed out after the author was born. The brother left home at 18 and hasn't helped with the funeral. The author went to talk to him, told him he should help for their mom's sake, and the brother got angry and refused. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here. The brother has a valid reason not to help because of the abuse. The author tried to mediate by appealing to the mom's feelings. But forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive might be a stretch. The brother isn't obligated to help if he doesn't want to, especially after the trauma. The author's intention was to help the mom, but they didn't consider that Jeff's refusal is about his own healing. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they didn't force Jeff, just tried to convince him. But maybe they should have respected Jeff's decision instead of pushing him. The moral obligation here is tricky. The author might have thought it's about family duty, but Jeff's well-being is also important. The answer would be B, No, because the author isn't in the wrong for trying to mediate, even if Jeff refused. They were trying to support their mom, which is understandable. However, there's a nuance where maybe they should have respected Jeff's choice more, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, just had a conflict, the answer is B.\n"
