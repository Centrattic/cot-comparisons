Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive towards Jeff but mellowed out later. Jeff left home early and now refuses to help with the funeral planning, which is causing their mom distress. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he needs to help for Mom's sake, which led to Jeff getting angry and refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has a history of abuse from their dad, which makes his refusal understandable. The author might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma, given that their dad was nicer when they were younger. \n\nIs the author wrong for pushing Jeff to help? Well, they were trying to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. The key points are the obligation to family versus personal trauma. Funerals are typically family affairs, so expecting some involvement makes sense, but if Jeff has unresolved trauma, forcing him could be harmful.\n\nThe author might have a right to want their mom comforted, but they should also respect Jeff's boundaries. Maybe they didn't communicate effectively or acknowledge Jeff's feelings. The author's approach was confrontational, which might have escalated the situation. Instead of demanding help, maybe they should have discussed it more gently, understanding Jeff's reasons.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had good intentions but maybe overstepped by not considering Jeff's trauma and his right to distance himself from the abusive parent. The answer might hinge on balancing family obligations with personal well-being. Therefore, the author could be seen as not entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they acted with intent to help Mom but perhaps without full empathy for Jeff, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as they weren't malicious, but there's room for criticism in their approach.\n"
