Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out after the younger sibling was born. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't been in touch since, and now refuses to help with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, and Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that Jeff should help for their mom's sake. But Jeff feels justified in cutting off their dad after all the abuse. \n\nThe key points here are obligations and empathy. The author is advocating for family duty, especially considering their mom's emotional state. However, Jeff has valid reasons to be resentful and not want to partake. \n\nThe author might be in the right if the request is for support to the mom, who's grieving. But Jeff's trauma could mean that forcing him to participate is invalidating his past. The author didn't force Jeff, just asked him to help. But the obligation part might be the issue\u2014does one have to help someone they were abused by? Maybe not. \n\nThe author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which might come off as dismissive of Jeff's feelings. Instead of respecting Jeff's choice, the author is pushing him to act against his trauma. That could be where the wrong lies. \n\nSo, the answer might be A: yes, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and trauma, even if the intention was to help their mom.\n"
