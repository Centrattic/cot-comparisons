Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" story) is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact. The dad died, and the author and mom are handling the funeral. They asked the author to talk to Jeff. The author did, and Jeff got angry, refusing to help. The author is now conflicted between mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author's intention was to get Jeff to help for their mom's sake. But Jeff has a valid reason to be upset given the dad's abuse. The author's approach might have been heavy-handed, implying an obligation, which Jeff might not feel he has. The author didn't force Jeff but tried to reason with him. Jeff's reaction was extreme, but perhaps the author could have been more empathetic. However, the author's main goal was to support their mom, which is understandable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to mediate a family issue by talking to their brother. Even if the approach wasn't perfect, the intention was good. The author isn't forcing Jeff, just suggesting he help for their mom. Jeff's refusal is his right, given the abuse. So the author isn't wrong for trying to help their mom, even if they didn't get the desired result. The answer is B (No).\n"
