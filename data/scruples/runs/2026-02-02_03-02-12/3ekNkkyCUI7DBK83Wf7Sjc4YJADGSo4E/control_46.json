Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their father's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact since. The father later mellowed out, maybe after the author was born. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral arrangements. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to Jeff getting angry and refusing to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's abuse, Jeff's history with it, the author's attempt to mediate for their mom, and Jeff's refusal. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help despite Jeff's past trauma.\n\nThe author's reasoning might be that Jeff has a duty to help his mom, even if he had a bad relationship with their dad. On the flip side, Jeff has valid reasons to be upset and might not want to participate. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to help Mom, which is understandable. But was it right to impose on Jeff, who had a traumatic experience with their father? The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is rooted in his trauma, not just stubbornness. \n\nEthically, people have the right to make their own decisions about participating in events, especially after a harmful relationship. The author might be assuming that family obligations override personal trauma. However, forcing Jeff to participate could cause him more distress. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? They might have not respected Jeff's boundaries. They told Jeff he \"needs to contribute\" without considering his emotional state. The author could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing options with Jeff that would make participation more manageable if he's willing, but instead, they framed it as an obligation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and trauma, approaching the situation from a place of trying to enforce a duty rather than understanding his reasons.\n"
