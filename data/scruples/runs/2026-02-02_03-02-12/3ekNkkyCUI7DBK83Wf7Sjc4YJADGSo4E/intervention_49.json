Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad\u2014abuse, yelling, etc. The author, who's younger, didn't experience that abuse directly, but knows about it from Jeff and their mom. When their dad died, the mom wanted Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff refused, even getting angry at the author for trying to convince him.\n\nThe author went to Jeff's place to ask him to help for their mom's sake. Jeff responded angrily, saying the author didn't understand and refusing. The author is now conflicted, between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's pain.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author have a right to approach Jeff about helping, and was their approach appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to help their mom by reaching out to Jeff, which shows consideration for her feelings. They might have thought that even though Jeff had a bad relationship with their dad, helping with the funeral would ease their mom's grief. Also, the author is in a middle position, trying to mediate.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. He was abused by their dad, and the author acknowledges that Jeff's experience was real. The author might have not fully considered Jeff's emotional state and his right to distance himself from someone who caused him harm. The author's approach could have been seen as pressuring Jeff to reconcile with a harmful past, which Jeff might not be willing to do.\n\nBut the author's intention was to help their mom, which is a family concern. However, forcing or expecting someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive could be seen as insensitive. The author might not have framed it correctly, not respecting Jeff's boundaries. But Jeff's refusal is about his own trauma, and the author's attempt was to bridge that gap for their mom's sake.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but maybe they could have approached it differently. The main issue is that the author didn't fully grasp Jeff's reasons and how deeply hurt he is. However, the author's actions stem from a place of wanting to help their mother, which is understandable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
