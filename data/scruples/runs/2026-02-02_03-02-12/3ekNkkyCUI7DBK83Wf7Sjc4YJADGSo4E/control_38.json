Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to the brother (Jeff) when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact much. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff and told him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that Jeff should help because of Mom. The question is whether the author is right to push Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, family obligations can be complex. The author is trying to mediate between Jeff and their mom. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to help with his abusive father's funeral. The author might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. However, the author's intention was to consider Mom's feelings, which is also valid. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to bring up an obligation that Jeff might not feel, given his past. The author's approach could be seen as imposing their own expectations without understanding Jeff's perspective. But maybe they were trying to help their mom. However, whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on whether they had the right to tell Jeff he must help. Jeff has the right to choose not to participate, especially given the abuse. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they might have overstepped by not respecting Jeff's boundaries. But the answer options are A or B. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they had good intentions and were trying to help their mom, even if their approach could be better. Alternatively, maybe A because they forced Jeff into a situation he's not comfortable with. Hmm. I need to decide based on the context. The author's actions were based on trying to ease Mom's distress, but Jeff's right to refuse is also important. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were advocating for their mom's feelings, but they should have considered Jeff's position more. But the question is if they are in the wrong. If the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. If A, they are. I think the consensus would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they had good intentions and were trying to support their mom, even though Jeff's refusal is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
