Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive, especially to the older brother, Jeff. The younger sibling (the author) mentions that their dad mellowed out after they were born, but Jeff had a rough time. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, so the author went to talk to Jeff. The author told Jeff he should help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry, blamed the author for not understanding, and refused to help.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. They tried to mediate between Jeff and their mom. Jeff's refusal is based on past trauma, which is valid. But the author didn't force Jeff to do anything; they just asked him to consider Mom's feelings. \n\nThe key points here are intentions and outcomes. The author's goal was to help their mom, which is a legitimate concern. Jeff's choice to not participate is his right, especially given the abuse. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to encourage Jeff, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the situation is complex, and the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to support their mom. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted out of concern for their mother and tried to reconcile the family, even if Jeff's reaction was harsh. The author didn't push beyond what was reasonable, just expressed the mom's feelings and asked Jeff to help, which he refused. The author isn't to blame here.\n"
