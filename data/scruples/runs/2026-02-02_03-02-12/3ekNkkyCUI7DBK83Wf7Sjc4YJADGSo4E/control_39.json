Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive, especially towards Jeff when he was younger. He drank a lot and was physically and emotionally abusive. After the author was born, he mellowed out and got sober. The author didn't experience the same abuse as Jeff. Jeff left home when he was 18 and hasn't been in contact since. Now the dad has died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help for their mom's sake, but Jeff was hostile and refused. The author is now torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's pain.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. \n\nFactors to consider: The dad was abusive, so Jeff's refusal might stem from trauma. The author tried to mediate for the mom's well-being, but maybe they should have respected Jeff's boundaries. Obligations can be subjective. The author might not fully grasp Jeff's experiences, as he wasn't abused the same way. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to help their mom, which is understandable. But they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state. The key is whether the author had the right to impose an obligation on Jeff when Jeff has valid reasons not to participate. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, Jeff's trauma is significant, and the author's push might be unfair. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn some cases, family obligations are expected, but when there's a history of abuse, those obligations might not be so clear. The author's intention was good, but maybe they didn't account for Jeff's feelings adequately. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but it's a nuanced situation. Alternatively, maybe A, because they forced Jeff into a situation he wasn't comfortable with. \n\nHmm. The story doesn't say if the family had any prior communication about this. If Jeff had already made it clear he wouldn't help, maybe the author should have respected that. On the other hand, the mom is distraught, so the author was trying to support her. It's tough. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was attempting to mediate and support their mom, which is a reasonable effort, even if Jeff's response was harsh. The author's approach might not have been perfect, but the intent was to help, so they're not necessarily wrong.\n"
