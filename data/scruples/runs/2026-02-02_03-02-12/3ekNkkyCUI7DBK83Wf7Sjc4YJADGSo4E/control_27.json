Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family where the dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. The author, who is the younger sibling, is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral. Jeff didn't want to help because of the dad's past behavior, but the author told him he had an obligation, which led to Jeff getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, which is really serious. The author wasn't around when the abuse happened as much, maybe because he was younger or because the dad mellowed out. Jeff moved out early and hasn't been in contact. Now the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe author went to Jeff to convince him to help, saying he needs to contribute for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted badly, feeling that the author doesn't understand his trauma. The question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he has an obligation.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help their mom, which is a valid concern. Maybe they think it's important for the family to come together, even in death. But on the other hand, Jeff has a history of abuse and might not feel any obligation to honor someone who was cruel to him. The author might not fully grasp how traumatic that was for Jeff.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention versus Jeff's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they might have failed to consider Jeff's perspective. However, they did approach Jeff, which shows they tried to resolve the issue. But telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" could be seen as pressuring someone who has valid reasons to refuse. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps they could have handled it differently. But according to the options, it's either A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Since the author acted out of concern for their mom and tried to mediate, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the author should have respected Jeff's decision not to participate, then maybe they are. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the author's main goal was to help the mom and they approached Jeff, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
