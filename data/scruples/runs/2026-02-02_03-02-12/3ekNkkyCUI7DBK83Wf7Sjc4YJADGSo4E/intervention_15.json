Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, but mellowed out after the author was born. The mom is upset because Jeff won't help with the funeral, and the author tried to convince him. Jeff got angry and refused. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, so Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author, however, is trying to mediate for the mom's sake. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nThe author's intention was to help the mom, which is understandable. But the brother has a history of trauma. The author might not have considered the depth of Jeff's feelings. However, the author didn't force Jeff but tried to communicate. Jeff's reaction was extreme, but his reasons are valid given his past. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to help their mom, but maybe they should have respected Jeff's boundaries. But Jeff's refusal is also valid. The author's approach might have been right, but the outcome is a conflict. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action was to mediate, but perhaps they should have approached it differently. However, they weren't in the wrong for trying to help. So the answer is B.\n"
