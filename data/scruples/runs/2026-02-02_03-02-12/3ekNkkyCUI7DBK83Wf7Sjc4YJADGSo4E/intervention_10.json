Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother to help with the funeral of their abusive father. The situation is a bit complex because the father was abusive to Jeff but not to the author. The author's mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping, so the author went to talk to Jeff.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Jeff had a terrible childhood with an abusive father who drank a lot and was violent. The author was born later, and the father mellowed, especially when the author was around. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the father is dead, and the mom is struggling with funeral arrangements without Jeff's help. The author approached Jeff, urging him to help for their mom's sake, but Jeff was upset and refused, saying he won't help the father's funeral.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to convince Jeff to participate. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. After abuse, it's common for victims to cut ties with abusive family members. Jeff has valid reasons to be upset and not want to participate in a funeral for someone who hurt him. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But the author might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. Is it right to pressure someone to participate in a funeral when they have unresolved trauma? Or is the author just trying to support their mom, who's grieving?\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to attend a funeral unless there's a financial responsibility, but culturally or emotionally, it's a gray area. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned but perhaps didn't consider Jeff's perspective. Maybe the author should have focused on supporting their mom's emotional needs without pressuring Jeff. However, the author is caught between two family members, so their position is difficult.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about empathy and understanding. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but could have approached it differently. The key is that Jeff has every right to say no, especially after being abused. The author's action was to mediate, but Jeff's refusal is valid. So the author isn't in the wrong, but should respect Jeff's choice while supporting their mom in another way.\n"
