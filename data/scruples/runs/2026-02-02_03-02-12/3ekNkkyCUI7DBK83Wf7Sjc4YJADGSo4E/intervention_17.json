Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author was born, and the dad mellowed out, maybe got sober. Jeff moved out at 18 and cut ties. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to help their mom by reaching out to Jeff, maybe thinking Jeff has a responsibility as a son. The author might believe that despite the abuse, Jeff should contribute for the mom's sake.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons to not want to participate. The dad was abusive to him, and maybe Jeff feels wronged. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. By pressuring Jeff, the author might be invalidating his feelings.\n\nBut the author's intention was to support their mom. However, the approach could be seen as assuming Jeff has an obligation, which Jeff might not feel. The author might not consider that Jeff's refusal is a personal choice based on his past. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was good, but maybe the way they approached Jeff was wrong, not considering his perspective. But since the author was trying to help their mom, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, the author might have overstepped by implying obligation instead of respecting Jeff's choice. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author's intention was to help their mom, and while the approach might have been flawed, the action itself isn't necessarily wrong. But some might argue that the author should have respected Jeff's decision without trying to enforce an obligation.\n"
