Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when he was drinking. The author was born, and the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in contact since. Now the dad died, and the author and mom are handling the funeral but Jeff isn't helping. The mom asked the author to talk to Jeff, and when they did, Jeff got angry and refused to help. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to push Jeff to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse, Jeff's justified anger, and the expectation of family obligation. The author believes Jeff should help for Mom's sake. But Jeff feels that because of the abuse, he doesn't want to be part of the funeral. \n\nI need to consider if the author was wrong to impose this obligation on Jeff. The author might think it's about family duty, but Jeff has a valid reason not to participate. The abuse was real and traumatic. The author might not fully understand Jeff's pain, especially since they weren't around for the worst of it. \n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But pushing Jeff to participate in something he's emotionally opposed to might not be fair. The author could have considered that Jeff's refusal is a way of coping with past trauma. \n\nAlso, the author's role as a mediator here might not be effective. Confronting Jeff might have escalated the situation. Maybe the author should have discussed other ways to support their mom without forcing Jeff. \n\nIn the end, the question is about whether the author was wrong. If the author's action was based on a good intention but overlooked Jeff's justified feelings, then maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But if the author forced an obligation without empathy, that could be seen as wrong. However, given the context of the mom's distress and the author trying to mediate, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, the author tried to do the right thing by their mom; on the other, they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. Hmm.\n"
