Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when he was drinking. After the narrator was born, the dad mellowed out and became sober. Jeff left home when he was 18, and now the dad has died. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral arrangements. The narrator went to talk to Jeff, told him he should help for their mom's sake, and Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the narrator did the wrong thing by pressuring Jeff to help. Let's break it down.\n\nJeff has a valid reason not to want to be involved in the funeral. He was abused by their father. The dad's behavior was terrible when Jeff was a kid. The narrator acknowledges that Jeff's experiences were real and that he might be justified in his anger. The narrator also mentions that they didn't experience the same abuse, so they can't fully understand Jeff's perspective.\n\nHowever, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The narrator tried to mediate, but Jeff refused. The narrator is now caught between their mom and Jeff's feelings.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to ask Jeff to help? Well, the narrator's intention was to help their mom. But Jeff has every right to distance himself from the funeral if he wants, given his past. The narrator might not have considered that Jeff isn't obligated to participate, especially if it causes him trauma. Instead of pushing Jeff, maybe the narrator should have focused on supporting Jeff's choice while still trying to support Mom.\n\nThe key points here are the right to personal choice and respecting Jeff's trauma. The narrator might not be in the wrong for trying to help Mom, but they might have overstepped by implying that Jeff has an obligation. The obligation might not be there, considering the abuse. So, the answer might be that the narrator isn't in the wrong because they're trying to support Mom, but they should also respect Jeff's decision. Alternatively, if the narrator made Jeff feel forced, that could be the issue.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The original poster is asking if they did the wrong thing by telling Jeff he's obligated to help. The answer would depend on whether that obligation exists. Since Jeff was abused, his refusal is understandable. The narrator might have been right to try to get Jeff to help for Mom's sake, but maybe the approach was wrong. However, the narrator was following their mom's request to talk to Jeff. The question is about being in the wrong. The narrator might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough. However, the fact that Jeff was abused gives him a valid reason not to participate. So the narrator's insistence might be seen as invalidating Jeff's experience. Therefore, the narrator might be in the wrong for pressuring Jeff, making answer A.\n\nBut wait, the narrator's intention was good. They were trying to help their mom. However, the obligation might not exist because of Jeff's past. So the answer could be A, but maybe B because the narrator's intention was to help their mom. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Let me check the options again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author told Jeff he has an obligation to help. But considering Jeff's history, maybe the author was wrong to impose that obligation. Therefore, answer A. But some might argue that the author was just trying to help and not wrong. Hmm. I think the answer is A because they didn't respect Jeff's choice and imposed an obligation despite his trauma.\n"
