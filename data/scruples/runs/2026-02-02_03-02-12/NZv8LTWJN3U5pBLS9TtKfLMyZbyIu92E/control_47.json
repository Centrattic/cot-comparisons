We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's daughter recently moved in with them after a tough breakup and depression. She's making progress\u2014getting a job, going back to school, therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, but the author is understanding because she has a lot on her plate. Then the mother-in-law visits, and the husband and mom start criticizing the daughter in front of her, talking about her cat and her cleaning habits. The daughter is upset, the husband doesn't apologize, and the author explodes, telling them to fuck off or be respectful. The author then takes the daughter out to console her. Now, the family is upset and hasn't spoken since.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overreacted or was justified. Let's think about the key points.\n\nThe daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public criticism from family members, especially parents, can be really damaging. The husband and mother-in-law brought up the messiness in a judgmental way in front of her, which was hurtful. The daughter's reaction (crying, self-deprecating comments) suggests that the criticism had a negative impact. The husband didn't apologize, which probably made things worse. The author stepped in to defend the daughter, which is a protective response. The outburst was a result of frustration and concern for the daughter's mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, the author used strong language (\"fuck off\") which is aggressive and might be considered disrespectful. However, the context is that they were protecting their child from harmful comments. The author's intention was to stop the negativity directed at their daughter. \n\nThe husband and mother-in-law might feel that they were just giving constructive feedback, but doing it in front of the daughter and in a critical manner wasn't considerate. The author's intervention, while harsh, was aimed at preventing further harm to the daughter's self-esteem. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did yell and use strong language, which is unorthodox and could be seen as unkind. But the underlying motivation was to protect their daughter from bullying by their own family. The husband and mother-in-law didn't seem to consider the daughter's feelings in that moment. \n\nIn terms of right vs wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were driven by a desire to support their daughter during a sensitive time. The husband and mother-in-law's comments could have set the daughter back in her recovery. The author's outburst might not be the ideal way to handle it, but it was a response to a stressful situation where the daughter's mental health was at stake. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They acted to protect their daughter from harmful criticism, even if the method was not the most diplomatic. The key point is the intent to shield the daughter from further emotional harm, which seems justified given her mental health history.\n"
