We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband in front of her daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, who's 26, has been through a tough time with depression and has made a lot of progress. She's working, in school, and in therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which is a change from before her depression. The author is more understanding, probably because she knows how hard it's been for the daughter. \n\nThen, the mother visits and the husband and mother start criticizing the daughter in front of her. They mention the cat's litter box and imply she's not capable. The daughter is upset, tells her dad he hurt her feelings, but he doesn't apologize. The author consoles her daughter, but the parents continue. The author loses her temper and tells them to shut up or leave, then takes the daughter to calm down. Now the family is upset with her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect and the mental health impact. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, and public criticism from family could set her back. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which shows concern for her mental health. However, the method of confrontation\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might be seen as extreme. \n\nBut considering the context: the daughter's well-being is at stake, and the parents were being unkind and not apologizing. The author might feel justified in defending her daughter, especially if she sees the criticism as harmful. It's a tough balance between addressing the issue and maintaining family relationships. \n\nOn one hand, yelling isn't ideal; maybe a calmer approach could have been better. On the other hand, standing up for a family member being unfairly criticized, especially when it could affect their mental health, is understandable. The mother and husband might not realize the impact of their words. \n\nThe answer may depend on cultural norms and family dynamics. In some cultures, direct confrontation is less acceptable, while in others, it's seen as necessary to protect a loved one. The daughter's mental health is a critical factor here. If the criticism had continued, it could have been detrimental. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Possibly not. She acted to protect her daughter from perceived harm. Her anger stems from concern. However, the way she handled it could have been more constructive. But given the circumstances, she might not be in the wrong. I think the answer is B, No.\n"
