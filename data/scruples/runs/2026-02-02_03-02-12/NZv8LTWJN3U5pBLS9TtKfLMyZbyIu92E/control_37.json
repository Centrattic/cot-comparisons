We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter, who is dealing with depression and has recently improved, but is being criticized for being messy by her father and the author's mother. The author lost their temper and told the husband and mother to \"fuck off,\" leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and is making progress. Publicly criticizing her in front of her might trigger a setback. The husband and mother were talking about her messiness and the cat's litter box in front of her, which upset her. The daughter was already emotional and felt attacked. The author intervened to protect their daughter's mental health.\n\nThe author's outburst was a response to what they perceive as an attack on their daughter. While using harsh language is unwise, the motivation was protective. The daughter's mental health is a significant factor here. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism might have escalated the situation. The author's actions, though harsh, were in defense of their child's well-being. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the intention to protect the daughter and the immediate context of emotional distress. The author's actions were reactive to protect their child from perceived harm. While the language used was extreme, the underlying motivation was protective. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the action was driven by a desire to shield the daughter from further mental health issues, even if the method was not ideal.\n"
