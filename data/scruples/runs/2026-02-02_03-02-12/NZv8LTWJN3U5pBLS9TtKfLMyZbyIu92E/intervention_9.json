We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter with depression who's trying to recover, and her parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being messy in front of her. The author, the mother, steps in and yells at them to stop or leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is doing well after a tough time. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which is understandable, but bringing it up in front of her is unkind, especially given her mental health history. The mother-in-law agreeing with the criticism isn't helpful either. The daughter was already upset, and the parents didn't apologize, which probably made her feel worse.\n\nThe author's reaction was to tell them off. While yelling isn't the most diplomatic approach, the motivation was to protect her daughter's feelings and mental health. The daughter's emotional state is a crucial factor here. If the parents continue to criticize her without support, it could set back her recovery. The author intervened when she felt her daughter was being verbally abused, which shows she was trying to be a good parent.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? On one hand, yelling can be seen as harsh. On the other, the situation was emotionally charged, and her action was a response to protect her child. The key points are the intent to protect, the emotional state of the daughter, and the lack of support from the husband and mother-in-law. The author's actions were reactive but with good intentions. So, likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
