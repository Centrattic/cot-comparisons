We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband and mother criticizing the daughter in front of her, which leads to the daughter being upset and the author losing her temper and telling them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is struggling with depression and has made significant progress. The husband and mother are criticizing her in front of her, which is really hurtful. The author steps in to defend her daughter, which is seen as a protective action. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nLooking at the actions: The husband venting about the daughter's messiness in front of her is problematic. The mother agreeing and adding to the criticism is also not good. The author's reaction is a direct response to protect their daughter's feelings. While yelling and using strong language (like \"fuck off\") might be seen as harsh, the intent was to stop the hurtful comments and support the daughter during a vulnerable time. The author's actions were aimed at preventing further harm to the daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern given her history of depression.\n\nThe author's husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism after the daughter was upset adds to the tension. The author's decision to take the daughter away suggests they were trying to de-escalate the situation and provide support. Admitting fault for losing temper but standing by the reason (protecting the daughter) is a balanced perspective.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while the language used is strong, the context of defending a vulnerable family member might mitigate the severity. The main issue was the public shaming of the daughter by the husband and mother, which the author intervened against. So, the author's action is more about protection than being wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
