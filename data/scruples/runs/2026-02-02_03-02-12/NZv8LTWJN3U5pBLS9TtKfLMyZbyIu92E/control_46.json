We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, her husband, her mother, and her adult daughter. The daughter has been recovering from depression and has been working hard to improve her life. The husband and mother criticized the daughter's messiness in front of her, leading the author to lose her temper and tell them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter has made significant progress after a difficult period. The husband and mother publicly criticized her, which caused emotional distress. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which led to a rift with her husband and mother. The question is whether the author was wrong to react that way.\n\nThe husband's venting and the mother's agreement in front of the daughter seem to be the root of the problem. Public criticism can be hurtful, especially for someone recovering from depression. The author's reaction was a direct response to protect her daughter's feelings. While the language used was harsh (\"fuck off\"), the intent was to defend her daughter. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be seen as confrontational. Arguing in front of her daughter might not have been the best strategy. But considering the daughter's mental health, the author's priority was to prevent further emotional harm. The husband not apologizing to the daughter is also a point against him. The mother's continued criticism after the daughter was upset adds to the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's outburst could be seen as justified given the circumstances. The daughter's mental health is a critical factor here. The author took action to stop her loved ones from undermining her daughter's progress. The fact that the author is feeling bad about her reaction but also concerned about her daughter's well-being suggests that her intentions were protective.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on intentions and the impact of actions. The husband and mother's behavior contributed to the daughter's emotional pain, so the author's reaction was a response to their actions. While the method might not have been ideal, the intent was to protect her daughter. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer could lean towards B, but I need to consider cultural norms and social expectations as well. In some contexts, public confrontation might be seen as inappropriate, but given the daughter's vulnerability, it's a protective measure. So, the answer is B.\n"
