We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's mother and husband criticizing their daughter in front of her, leading the author to lose her temper and tell them to fuck off. \n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression and is doing well now, which is important. The husband and mother are pointing out her messiness and the cat's care, which the daughter is handling as she's busy with work, school, and therapy. The daughter was emotional after being criticized, and the author stepped in to defend her. \n\nThe key points are that the criticism happened in front of the daughter, which is harmful, especially considering her mental health. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the berating. The author's reaction was to defend her daughter from being belittled by the people she's close to. \n\nWhile yelling and using strong language isn't ideal, the author's intention was to protect her daughter's mental health. The mother and husband were in the wrong for publicly criticizing the daughter, so the author's reaction, though intense, might be justified in that context. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently, like addressing it privately. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the public nature of the criticism, the author's actions were a response to protect her. The question is whether the author is at fault. Considering the circumstances, the answer is likely B (No), because the author was defending her daughter from harmful criticism.\n"
