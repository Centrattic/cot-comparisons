We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the woman is in a happy marriage and has a normal relationship with her mother. Her daughter, who's 26, moved in after a tough breakup and depression. The daughter has been doing well recently\u2014getting a job, going to school, therapy. The husband is frustrated with her messiness, which the author thinks is due to her past depression. The mother-in-law comes to visit, and both the husband and mother criticize the daughter in front of her, including about her cat. The daughter gets upset, and when the author tries to console her, the mother and husband keep berating her. The author loses her temper and tells them to be respectful or leave. She takes her daughter to calm down. Now the family is upset, and she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nSo, key points: The daughter is making progress in her recovery. Public criticism from husband and mother-in-law triggers her emotional breakdown. The author steps in to protect her daughter, which causes a rift with her husband and mother. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let me consider both sides. Arguably, she was defending her daughter from public shaming, which is harmful, especially for someone with a history of depression. On the other hand, yelling at her husband and mother might be seen as losing control. But given the context, the daughter's mental health is at stake. The husband and mother were being unkind and not considering the daughter's sensitive state. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe husband not apologizing after hurting his daughter's feelings is problematic. The mother-in-law also didn't back off when the daughter was upset. So, the author's actions were a response to a harmful situation. While yelling isn't ideal, the intent was protective. Therefore, it's more about standing up for her daughter rather than being the asshole. So, answer B (No).\n"
