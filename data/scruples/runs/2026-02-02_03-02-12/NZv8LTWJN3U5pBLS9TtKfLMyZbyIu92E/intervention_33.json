We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, the daughter came back home after a tough breakup and has been struggling with depression. She's improved a lot, getting a job, going to school, therapy, which the mom is proud of. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mom agrees when she visits. They confront the daughter in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The mom then takes her out to calm her down, but yells at the husband and mom to \"fuck off\" or something like that. \n\nThe author is asking if they're the a**hole. The user thinks they're not in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The daughter is dealing with a lot, and her parents are criticizing her for things like messiness and not taking care of the cat. Even if the daughter is messy, she's under a lot of stress with school, job, therapy. The parents bring up these issues in front of her, which is hurtful. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother kept going at it. The author steps in to defend her daughter, which seems like a protective act. \n\nIs yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" justified? Well, the daughter was crying and feeling like a piece of shit. The parents' actions might have been a trigger for her mental health. The mom intervened to protect her daughter, which is a good intention, but the method was harsh. However, considering the context of the daughter's mental state and the parents' public criticism, maybe the mom's reaction is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, using such strong language might not be the best approach. But the mom has never spoken like that before, and she's now cut off from her husband and mother. The question is whether the mom overreacted. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents (husband and mother) initiated the situation by berating the daughter in front of her. The mom acted to defend her daughter. The author's actions were a response to the immediate harm caused to her daughter. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their child's mental health. \n\nBut maybe the way they handled it was inappropriate. However, given the emotional context and the daughter's vulnerability, the mom's reaction is a protective measure. The parents (husband and mother) are also at fault for their initial behavior. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. The key is that the daughter's mental health is at stake, and the parents' actions were harmful. The mom took action to stop the harm, even if the method was harsh. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
