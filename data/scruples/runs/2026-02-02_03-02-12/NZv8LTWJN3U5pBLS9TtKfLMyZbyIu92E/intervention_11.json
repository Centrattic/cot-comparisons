We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's daughter, who's recovering from depression, and her parents and the author's mother criticizing her messiness in front of her. The author lost their temper and told them to fuck off. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The daughter is making progress in her recovery, which is significant. Public shaming in front of her could be harmful, especially given her history. The husband and mother-in-law's behavior seems unkind and potentially counterproductive. The author stepped in to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut was the author's response appropriate? Yelling and using harsh language might not be the best approach, but the intent was to protect their child. The question is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. The author's main motivation was to prevent further harm to their daughter, which is a strong rationale. \n\nConsidering the balance between protecting a vulnerable family member and the method used, the author's actions, while extreme, were driven by concern. The alternative\u2014letting the daughter face public criticism\u2014could have been worse. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). However, it's possible someone might argue that the author could have handled it differently, but the core issue is about protecting a child's well-being.\n"
