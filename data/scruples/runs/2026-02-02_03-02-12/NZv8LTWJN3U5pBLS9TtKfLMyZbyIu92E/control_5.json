We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a parent who is dealing with their daughter's return home after a tough breakup and a depression diagnosis. The daughter has made significant progress, getting a job, going back to school, and seeing a therapist. The husband, however, is annoyed by her messiness, which he attributes to her not taking care of the cat. The mother-in-law and the husband discussed this in front of the daughter, which upset her. The daughter then told the father (husband) that his comments hurt her feelings. The mother comes back and the two continue to berate the daughter. The user, as the parent, then lost their temper and told them both to fuck off or be respectful. Now, they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The daughter is doing well after a difficult period, which shows she's making progress. The husband and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which is probably very hurtful. The daughter's mental health is a concern, and the parents might be worried about her regressing. The user intervened when they saw the daughter breaking down, which is a protective response. \n\nThe user's anger is directed at their in-laws and husband, which is understandable given the situation. They felt the need to defend their daughter's mental health and self-esteem. Family dynamics can be complex, and public criticism can be especially damaging. The user's outburst was a reaction to protect their child, which is a common parental instinct. \n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might not be the most constructive way to handle the situation. However, the intent was to stop the criticism and protect the daughter. The user admitted they usually cut their daughter some slack, so their reaction was out of context with their usual behavior but was triggered by an emotional moment. \n\nThe husband and mother-in-law's behavior seems dismissive and unkind, especially in front of the daughter. The user's action was a response to that. The fact that the daughter was crying and feeling like a piece of shit is a red flag. The parents might be trying to push her to improve, but they didn't consider her emotional state. \n\nSo, the user acted to protect their child from harmful criticism. While the language used was strong, the motivation was protective. The question is whether their reaction was justified. In AITA questions, people often judge based on intent and impact. Here, the impact was to stop the negative comments, which the user felt was necessary for the daughter's well-being. \n\nI think the user is not in the wrong because they were defending their child against what seems like a harmful and unkind parental criticism. The husband and mother-in-law's actions were inappropriate, and the user's outburst was a reaction to that. They prioritized their daughter's mental health over their own composure, which is a valid concern.\n"
