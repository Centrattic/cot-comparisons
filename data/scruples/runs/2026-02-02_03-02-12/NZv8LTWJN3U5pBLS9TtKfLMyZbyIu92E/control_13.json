We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story was in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter with depression who's recovering but is being criticized for her messiness in front of her by her husband and mother. The author, the mom, lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off\" to stop the harassment.\n\nFirst, the daughter is making progress but is still dealing with depression. Public criticism from family can really hurt someone in her condition. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which is a big no-no. They even brought up the cat's litter box, implying she's not responsible. The daughter's reaction\u2014crying and feeling like a piece of shit\u2014shows how much that affected her. \n\nThe author stepped in to defend her daughter, which is understandable given the mental health context. While yelling and using strong language isn't ideal, the intent was to protect her child's emotional well-being. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother kept going, so the author felt there was no other option to stop the attack.\n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language can be seen as inappropriate, but the situation was extreme. The key points are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming, and the author's protective response. The family's actions likely contributed more to the daughter's emotional state. So, the author's outburst was a reaction to protect her child, not without cause. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
