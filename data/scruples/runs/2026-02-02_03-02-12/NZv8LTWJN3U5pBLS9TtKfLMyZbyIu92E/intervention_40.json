We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting her husband and mother for criticizing her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter has been dealing with clinical depression but has improved a lot. She's taking care of school, a job, and therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which upset the daughter. The author then lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off.\" Now, the family hasn't spoken since, and the author is questioning if they were wrong to do that.\n\nThe author's main concern is protecting her daughter's mental health. The parents (husband and mother) were being critical in front of the daughter, which caused emotional distress. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, which is a natural response given the daughter's history. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, yelling and using strong language might be seen as harsh, but the context is important. The daughter's mental health is fragile, and public criticism from family could be detrimental. The husband and mother were out of line by bringing up the messiness in front of her, especially given her recent progress. The author's reaction was a defense of their child, which shows she's advocating for her daughter's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have chosen a calmer approach. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the immediate context, her outburst might be justified. The husband and mother didn't apologize, which adds to the tension. The author is now facing the consequences of her actions, but the root issue is the criticism of the daughter.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter from harmful criticism. While the method might have been inconsiderate, the intent was protective. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. But it's a bit nuanced because there's room for alternative actions, but the core issue is about defending a vulnerable family member.\n"
