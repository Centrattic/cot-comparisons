We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the daughter moving in with her parents after a difficult breakup and depression. She's improving, getting a job, school, therapy. But her husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother-in-law agrees. They confront her in front of her, which upsets the daughter. The author then yells at both the husband and mother-in-law to stop or leave, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, working on her mental health. Public shaming by family members could be detrimental. The author took action to protect their daughter, even if it was confrontational. \n\nThe husband's venting and the mother's agreement in front of the daughter might be seen as unkind and triggering. The author intervened to prevent further harm, which is a protective response. While yelling isn't ideal, the intent was to defend their child. \n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as extreme. However, given the situation's emotional weight, the author's reaction could be justified as a last resort to stop the harassment. \n\nThe key points are the daughter's mental health, the public nature of the criticism, and the author's intent to protect. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter from emotional harm, which is a strong mitigating factor. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but maybe with some nuance that their approach could have been better. However, in AITA terms, the community often looks at intent and the context of the harm done. Since the daughter was already struggling, preventing further emotional harm justifies the author's actions. So the answer is B.\n"
