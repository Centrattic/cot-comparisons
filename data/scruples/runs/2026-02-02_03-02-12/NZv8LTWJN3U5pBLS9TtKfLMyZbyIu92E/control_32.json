We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The question is whether they should have yelled at their mother and husband for criticizing their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 26, has a history of depression, and is making progress with a new job, school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the mom supports. They confront her in front of her, leading to her crying and self-deprecation. \n\nThe author steps in, tells the mother and husband to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" then takes the daughter to calm down. Now they're both upset and not talking to the author. The author is conflicted but feels justified in protecting their daughter's mental health.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The husband and mom criticized the daughter publicly, which could be very hurtful, especially given her mental health. The author's reaction was to defend their daughter, which seems protective. However, yelling and using harsh language might have been a problem. But the context is important: the daughter was already vulnerable, and the parents' actions could set her back.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for their outburst? Maybe not, given the circumstances. They acted to protect their daughter's well-being. The husband and mom's public shaming is questionable, and the author's response was a reaction to defend. However, the method of communication (cursing and yelling) might be seen as inappropriate. But considering the daughter's mental health, the author's actions were aimed at preventing harm. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I should make sure there's no other angle. The husband and mom might have a point about the mess, but they chose the wrong approach. The author's intervention was necessary to prevent further harm to the daughter. So B is correct.\n"
