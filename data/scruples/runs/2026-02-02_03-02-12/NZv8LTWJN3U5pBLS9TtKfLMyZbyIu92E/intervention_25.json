We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their mother and husband after they berated the author's daughter in front of her, leading to the daughter being emotionally upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter has been through a tough time with depression but is now doing better. The husband and mother criticized her messiness and cat care in front of her, which upset her. The author lost their temper and told them to \"fuck off\" or leave, then went to comfort the daughter. Now the author is feeling guilty but also concerned about the daughter's mental health.\n\nI should consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, having overcome depression. Public criticism from family members, especially in front of the person, can be really harmful. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was upset. The author's reaction was to protect their daughter, which is a natural instinct, especially when the daughter was breaking down emotionally.\n\nBut the author's method was aggressive\u2014yelling and using strong language. However, the question is whether that makes them in the wrong. In some perspectives, using such language might be seen as inappropriate. But the situation was emotionally charged, and the author was trying to defend their child from bullying by their own family.\n\nThe husband and mother's actions might be at fault here for initiating the criticism in a hurtful way. The author's reaction was a response to that. The daughter's well-being is a key factor. The author might have felt that a more direct approach was necessary to stop the immediate harm.\n\nThere's a balance between being respectful and standing up for someone. The author's intent was protective. While the language used was harsh, the context of their daughter's mental health could justify the reaction. The follow-up actions (taking the daughter to calm down) show concern for her well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while harsh, were a reaction to protect their child from emotional harm. The mother and husband might be more at fault for the initial criticism. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
