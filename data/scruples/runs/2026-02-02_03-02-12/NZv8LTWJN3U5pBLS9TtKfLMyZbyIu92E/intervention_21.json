We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband for berating their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter is dealing with depression and has made significant progress. The parents are trying to be supportive, but the husband is annoyed by the daughter's messiness. The mother and husband criticize the daughter in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author then loses their temper and tells them to \"fuck off,\" which caused a rift.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overreacted. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, and public criticism from her parents could set back her recovery. The author's reaction was to protect the daughter's feelings, which seems justified if the goal is to prevent harm. However, using harsh language and cutting off communication might be seen as impulsive or disrespectful, which could be a point against the author.\n\nBut considering the context: the daughter was crying, feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" and the parents weren't showing any remorse. The author intervened to stop the parents from further hurting the daughter. In that moment, the author's anger is directed at the people causing emotional harm, which could be seen as a protective measure rather than a personal attack. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue calmly or not confronting them in front of the daughter. But the immediate priority in the situation was preventing further emotional damage. \n\nAlso, the daughter has a lot on her plate, and the criticism from her parents is undermining her progress. The author's intervention might have been necessary to prevent a setback. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, and I'm inclined to agree. The parents' behavior was the root issue, and the author took a stand to protect their daughter. While the language was harsh, the intent was to stop harm, not just to be rude. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
