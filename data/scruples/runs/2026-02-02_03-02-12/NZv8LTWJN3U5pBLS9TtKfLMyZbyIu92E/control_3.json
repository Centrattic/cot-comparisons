We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter had a tough time with depression and has been making progress. The husband is frustrated with her messiness, and the mother agrees. They talked about her in front of her, leading to the daughter crying and feeling bad. The author intervened by yelling at them and telling them to fuck off. Now, the family is upset, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nKey points to consider: The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public criticism from family members can be detrimental to her mental health. The author likely felt protective, trying to defend her daughter from hurtful comments. On the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as aggressive and cutting off communication could strain family relationships.\n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction was justified. While yelling and using strong language might be unideal, the underlying motive was to protect her daughter's feelings. The husband and mother were being insensitive, and the author acted in defense. However, the method of confrontation could have been handled better. Maybe a calmer approach would have been more effective, but the emotional context is important. The daughter's well-being is a priority here.\n\nConsidering that the husband didn't apologize and the mother continued berating after the daughter was upset, the author's frustration is understandable. The use of \"fuck off\" is harsh, but the intent was to stop the negative behavior. Whether it's \"wrong\" depends on the cultural context and family dynamics, but in terms of the situation described, the author's action was a reaction to protect her daughter, which might be seen as justified despite the harsh words.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was defending her daughter from harmful criticism. However, the method could be questioned. But in AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the intent and circumstances. The author's intent was protective, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
