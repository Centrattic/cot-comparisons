We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her, especially since the daughter has been struggling with depression and has recently improved.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter moved in after a bad breakup and has been doing well, getting a job, going to school, and seeing a therapist. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, focusing on her messiness and the cat's care. The author intervened when they saw the daughter's emotional distress, leading to the outburst.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to yell and tell them to \"fuck off.\" To determine this, I should consider the context: the daughter's mental health is a big factor. Public criticism from family members could potentially trigger a relapse, especially if the daughter already feels insecure. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter's well-being. \n\nHowever, the author's method of handling the situation\u2014yelling and cutting off contact\u2014might be seen as excessive. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the intent to protect her, the author's reaction is understandable. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism after the daughter was upset adds to the justification for the author's response.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother might have had a right to express their concerns, but doing so in front of the daughter and not in a supportive manner was poor handling. The author's intervention, though harsh, was to defend their child's emotional health. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and the broader context. The author's primary goal was to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. The outburst was a direct response to an emotionally charged situation where the daughter was being attacked. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here.\n"
