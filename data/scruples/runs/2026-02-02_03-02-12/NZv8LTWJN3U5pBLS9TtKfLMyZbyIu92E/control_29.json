We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, their husband, mother, and their daughter.\n\nSo, the daughter moved in after a breakup and depression. She's improving, getting a job, going to school, therapy. But she's a bit messy, which the husband is upset about. The mother and husband talked about this in front of the daughter, criticized her, including her cat. The daughter was upset, the husband didn't apologize. The author then yelled at both, told them to fuck off or leave, took the daughter out. Now the family is upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The daughter is dealing with depression and has a lot on her plate. The parents are criticizing her in front of her, which is harsh, especially when she's vulnerable. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother and husband continued the criticism. The author intervened to protect their daughter's mental health. \n\nOn one hand, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as inappropriate. But on the other hand, they were trying to protect their daughter from being hurt by the people who were berating her. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their child's well-being. The daughter was in emotional distress, and the parents (husband and mother) weren't being supportive. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were standing up for their daughter. The husband and mother's behavior was the initial problem. The author's outburst was a response to protect their child. It's a stressful situation, and the author's actions were driven by concern for the daughter's mental health. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I consider all angles. Maybe some would argue that the author shouldn't have lost their temper regardless. However, given the context, it's a justified reaction to protect their daughter from further harm.\n"
