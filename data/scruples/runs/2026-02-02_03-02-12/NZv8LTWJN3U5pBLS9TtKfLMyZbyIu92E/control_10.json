We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author is a parent whose daughter is recovering from depression. The daughter is doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticize the daughter's messiness and cat care in front of her, leading to the daughter feeling awful. The author then yells at them to stop and takes the daughter away.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the daughter's mental health and the family's reaction. The daughter is in a fragile state, and public criticism from family members can really impact her recovery. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which seems like a protective action. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the author overreact? The husband and mother were being critical in front of the daughter, which isn't great. The author's outburst was a response to that, but the language used (\"fuck off\") could be seen as harsh. However, the context is that they were hurting their daughter's feelings, and the author was trying to defend her.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was clearly upset. The author's reaction was to stop the negative interaction. So, was the author wrong? Well, maybe not. They were protecting their daughter's mental health. The outburst might not be ideal, but the intent was to stop harm. \n\nAlternatively, could the author have handled it better without swearing? Possibly. But the situation was intense, and the daughter's emotional state was deteriorating. The author's actions were driven by concern for their daughter. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband and mother started the problematic behavior. The author's response was in defense of their daughter. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the primary issue was the family members' behavior towards the daughter, and the author acted to protect her.\n"
