We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's daughter has been through a tough time with depression but is now doing well. The daughter is working, going to school, and in therapy. The author and husband are supportive. However, the husband is annoyed by the daughter's messiness, which the author understands given her daughter's recent struggles. \n\nThen, during the mother's visit, the husband and mother publicly criticize the daughter in front of her, specifically about her cat and messiness. The daughter is upset, tells her dad he hurt her feelings, but he doesn't apologize. The author tries to comfort the daughter, but the parents continue berating her, leading the author to snap and tell them to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, standing up for a child's well-being is important, especially when they're recovering from depression. Public criticism can be harmful, and the author intervened to protect their daughter. However, the method\u2014yelling and using a strong phrase like \"fuck off\"\u2014might be seen as harsh, but the intent was protective. \n\nThe key factors here are the daughter's mental health and the public shaming by the husband and mother. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. While the approach was confrontational, the underlying motivation is protective and possibly justified given the daughter's vulnerable state. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B, but I need to ensure there's no other angle where the author's actions could be seen as inappropriate. However, the primary issue was the criticism of the daughter in a harmful way, so the author's intervention aligns with protecting their child. Therefore, answer B.\n"
