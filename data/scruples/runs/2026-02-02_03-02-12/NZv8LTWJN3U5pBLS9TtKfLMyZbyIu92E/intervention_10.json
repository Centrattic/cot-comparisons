We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter. \n\nFirst, the context: the daughter has been through a lot\u2014depression, a breakup, moving in with her parents. She's making progress with a job, school, therapy. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being messy in front of her, which is hurting her. The daughter starts crying and feels like everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. The author steps in, yells at them, and takes her daughter to calm down.\n\nThe key points here are the mental health of the daughter and the public humiliation by the husband and mother. The author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter from further emotional harm. She's already been cutting the daughter some slack, given her history. The husband not apologizing when the daughter is upset is another issue. The mother agreeing with the husband adds to the pressure.\n\nThe author's outburst was in defense of her daughter's well-being. While yelling isn't ideal, the intent was to stop the harmful behavior. The daughter's mental health is at stake, so the author's action can be seen as a protective measure. The husband and mother's behavior seems to be the root problem here. The author hasn't initiated contact since, which might be part of her processing the situation, but the question is specifically about whether she was in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. Her actions were in response to protect her daughter from emotional harm, which is a valid and justifiable reason, even if the method was confrontational.\n"
