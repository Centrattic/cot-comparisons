We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter moved in after a tough breakup and has been working on her recovery. She's managing a job, school, and therapy, which is a lot. The daughter's messiness is an issue, but the husband and mother are criticizing her in front of her. The author intervened by yelling at them to stop or leave. Now, they're not speaking to the author, and the author feels bad but also protective of their daughter.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to lose their temper. From the description, the daughter is in a vulnerable state, and the parents are adding stress by publicly shaming her. The author's reaction was a direct response to protect their daughter's mental health. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which might indicate he wasn't considering her feelings either. The mother's comments also seem harsh given the daughter's recent progress.\n\nThe author's outburst might be seen as an overreaction, but it's in defense of their daughter. The context is important here: the daughter's mental health is at stake. Public criticism can be damaging, especially when someone is recovering from depression. The author's actions were to stop the negative environment. However, using a strong expletive could be seen as unprofessional or harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a protective measure.\n\nComparing to similar situations, when a parent is criticized or a child is being unfairly treated, a strong reaction is often justified. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate. The husband and mother were directly contributing to the daughter's distress, so the author stepping in to stop them is understandable.\n\nIn many cases, family dynamics can be complex, but the priority here is the daughter's well-being. The author's actions were to prevent further harm. The husband's lack of apology also shows he didn't take the situation seriously, which might justify the author's frustration.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Their reaction was a justified attempt to protect their daughter from harmful criticism.\n"
