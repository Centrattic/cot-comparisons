We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mom, her husband, and their daughter who had been struggling with depression but is now doing better. The daughter moved in with them, and there's a conflict over her messiness. The husband and mother-in-law start criticizing her in front of her, which upsets the daughter. The author of the story (the mother) then yells at her husband and mother-in-law, telling them to be respectful or leave, and now they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter was in a tough spot with depression, has made significant progress, but is being criticized for her habits. The parents are trying to address the messiness, but they do it in front of her, which is hurtful. The daughter is emotionally vulnerable, and the criticism leads her to feel like a \"piece of shit.\" The author steps in to protect her daughter, which is understandable given the daughter's mental health history.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling. The husband and mother weren't considering the daughter's sensitivity, especially given her mental health. The author took a stand to defend her, which could be seen as protecting her from further harm. However, yelling might not be the most constructive approach. But given the context of the daughter's emotional state and the situation, the author's actions were a reaction to protect her child from hurtful comments made in front of her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intentions and context. The author's intention was to support her daughter, which is a valid concern. The husband and mother's public criticism might have been unkind and inconsiderate. The author's outburst, while harsh, was a response to a stressful and emotionally charged situation. So, the answer is more likely B (not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her daughter's mental health. However, there's a balance between protecting the daughter and reacting in a way that could be seen as disrespectful to others. But given the daughter's vulnerability, the author's actions are more justified.\n"
