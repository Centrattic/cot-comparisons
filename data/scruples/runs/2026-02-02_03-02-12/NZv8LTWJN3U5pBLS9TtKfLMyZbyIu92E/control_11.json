We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter moved back in after a tough breakup and depression. She's doing better now\u2014has a job, school, therapy. So she's making progress. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the author understands given her busy schedule. The mother and husband talked about this in front of the daughter, criticized her, even mentioned her cat. The daughter got upset, cried, and felt bad about herself. The author stepped in, took her daughter out, and then yelled at the two to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\" Now the family is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter is vulnerable, making progress but still struggling. The parents and husband publicly criticized her, which hurt her mentally. The author's response was to stand up for her daughter to protect her mental health. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, protecting a loved one's mental health is important. The daughter's reaction suggests the criticism was harmful. The author's outburst was a reaction to protecting her daughter from further harm. However, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as aggressive. But considering the context of the daughter's mental state and the public shaming, the author might feel it was necessary to stop the negative impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother's behavior could be seen as unkind, especially since the daughter is making efforts to improve. The husband didn't apologize when his daughter was crying, which isn't supportive. The mother agreeing might not be helpful either. \n\nThe author's action was a response to protect her daughter's well-being. While the method was harsh, the intention was protective. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the priority was her daughter's mental health. But some might argue that the approach could have been less confrontational. However, given the emotional state of the daughter, the immediate reaction makes sense. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong, as the action was to protect her daughter from harmful criticism during a vulnerable time.\n"
