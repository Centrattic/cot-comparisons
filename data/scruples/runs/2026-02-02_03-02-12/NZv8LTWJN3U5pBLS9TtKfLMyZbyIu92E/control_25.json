We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The story is about a daughter who's been struggling with depression and has made a lot of progress. However, her slobbishness is causing conflict between the author (the mother) and her husband, and the mother-in-law. The key event is when the mother and husband, in front of the daughter, criticize her for not cleaning the cat's litter box, leading the mother to lose her temper and tell them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The daughter has a lot on her plate\u2014full-time job, school, therapy. The mother is supporting her, cutting her some slack. The husband and mother, however, are publicly berating the daughter, which is hurtful. The daughter is already vulnerable with her mental health, so this could set her back. The mother's response was to yell and tell them to fuck off. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, using such strong language is not the best way to handle a conflict. It's confrontational and could damage relationships. On the other hand, the mother was defending her daughter from public humiliation and potential harm to her mental health. The criticism from the husband and mother was inconsiderate and could be seen as invalidating the daughter's efforts. \n\nThe mother's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter. The fact that the husband didn't apologize and the mother continued to berate the daughter might justify the mother's frustration. However, the method of expressing that frustration (using a swear word) might be seen as inappropriate. But in the context of defending a vulnerable daughter, some might argue it's understandable.\n\nSo, considering the mental health aspect and the fact that the mother was trying to protect her daughter from further harm, the author's actions might be seen as justified. The key is whether the means (yelling and strong language) were the wrong approach. But given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer could be B (No) because the mother was protecting her daughter's well-being, even if the method was harsh.\n"
