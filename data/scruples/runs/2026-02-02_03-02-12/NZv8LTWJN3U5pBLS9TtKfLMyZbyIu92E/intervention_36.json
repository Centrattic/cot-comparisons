We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user's daughter has been doing well after a tough breakup and depression, getting a job, going to school, therapy. She's a bit messy, which the husband is annoyed by, but the user is lenient. Then the mother-in-law and husband criticize the daughter in front of her, talking about the cat's litter box and the daughter's messiness. The daughter gets upset, cries, and the husband doesn't apologize. The user steps in, yells at them, tells them to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" then takes the daughter to calm down. The user hasn't reached out to the mother and husband since, and is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main points here: The daughter is in a vulnerable state, making progress, and the criticism from family is affecting her mental health. The parents' actions were inconsiderate and possibly harmful. The user's reaction was to defend the daughter, which is in her best interest. \n\nIs yelling and using strong language justified? It's a heated moment, and the daughter was breaking down. The user intervened to protect her mental health. The husband and mother not apologizing might have escalated the situation. The user is prioritizing the daughter's well-being over their parents' feelings. \n\nBut maybe the user could have handled it differently? Instead of yelling, maybe a private talk? But in the moment, emotions run high. The daughter was clearly distressed, and the user acted to stop the hurtful comments. \n\nAlso, the daughter's mental health is a key factor. If the parents continue to criticize, it might set her back. The user's actions were protective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
