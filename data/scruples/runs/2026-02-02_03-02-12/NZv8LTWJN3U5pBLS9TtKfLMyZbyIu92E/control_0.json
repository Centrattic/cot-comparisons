We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves the author's husband and mother criticizing the daughter in front of her, leading to the daughter feeling awful. The author lost her temper and told them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The daughter is recovering from depression, has a lot on her plate (job, school, therapy), and her parents and mother-in-law are publicly berating her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. This is in front of her, which is already a sensitive situation. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which adds to the problem. The mother continues the criticism, which pushes the author to snap.\n\nThe key points here are: the daughter's mental health, the public shaming, the lack of support from husband and mother, and the author's reaction. The author's goal was to protect her daughter's feelings, which is a valid concern. Public criticism can be detrimental to someone in recovery. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter, even if the words were harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as harsh, but the context is important. The author had never spoken to them like that before, indicating that this was a last resort. The husband and mother's behavior was the initial problem, so the author's reaction is a defense of her daughter's well-being. \n\nAlso, the daughter's self-esteem was at stake, and the author acted to prevent further harm. While the method might be extreme, the intent was protective. The AITA question hinges on whether the reaction was justified given the circumstances. Since the husband and mother were contributing to a harmful environment, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary stand to protect her daughter's mental health.\n"
