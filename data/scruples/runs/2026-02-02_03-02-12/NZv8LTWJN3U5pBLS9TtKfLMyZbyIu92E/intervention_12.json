We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mom, her husband, and their daughter. The daughter, who's dealing with depression, moved in and has been making progress. However, her messiness is a point of contention with the husband, and during a visit, the mother and husband publicly criticized the daughter in front of her, leading the mother and daughter to feel attacked. The author (mom) finally lost her temper and told them to shut up or leave, leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. The parents are supposed to support her, yet they're publicly shaming her for things like messiness and not handling the cat's litter. That's pretty harsh, especially in front of her. The mother's husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which compounds the issue. The mother then took the side of the daughter, which was probably necessary given the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the public shaming, the daughter's mental health, and the immediate emotional impact. The mother's outburst, while strong, was a reaction to protect her daughter's feelings. The question is whether her reaction is justified. In situations where a loved one is being publicly humiliated and it could negatively affect their mental health, standing up for them is crucial. The mother's anger stems from a place of wanting to protect her daughter, not just from the immediate criticism but also from the potential setback in her recovery.\n\nHowever, the husband and mother might feel that they were just giving honest feedback, but the way they did it was inconsiderate. The mother's use of strong language (\"fuck off\") is a point of contention. While the content of her message is about protecting her daughter, the method of delivery could be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, the emotional trigger for the mother is understandable. The daughter was crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" so the mother's reaction is a form of emergency intervention.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mother's actions were a reaction to protect her child's well-being. The husband and mother's actions were inappropriate given the daughter's mental state. So the mother isn't in the wrong for standing up for her daughter in that moment. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
