We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband during a tense situation involving their daughter.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The daughter has a history of depression and is currently trying to recover. The husband and mother are criticizing her in front of her, which is really triggering her. The daughter is already under a lot of stress with school, work, and therapy. The parents' comments about her messiness and the cat are not helping her self-esteem.\n\nThe author steps in when the daughter is clearly upset, which shows they care about protecting their child's mental health. The author's outburst was a reaction to seeing their daughter being belittled by family members. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism, escalating the situation.\n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. Yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" can be seen as inappropriate. But considering the context\u2014trying to defend a vulnerable family member from harmful criticism\u2014the intention was protective. The author felt their daughter's mental health was at risk, so their reaction, while harsh, was driven by concern.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a need for communication and perhaps a calmer approach. Maybe the author could have addressed the issue later with the husband and mother instead of an outburst. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can take over, especially when a loved one is being attacked.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and the daughter's well-being. The author's primary goal was to stop the verbal abuse, which was causing emotional harm. The method was extreme, but the underlying motivation was protective. Without that context, the action might seem harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a complex situation where the author's actions were a reaction to protect their child.\n"
