We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a parent, yelled at their husband and mother after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter was already struggling with depression but has been making progress. The husband and mother were talking about the daughter's messiness and her cat, which upset her, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable position. She's dealing with depression and has a lot on her plate\u2014job, school, therapy. The parents are supposed to support her. If the husband and mother are publicly berating her for things that are difficult for her, that's not helpful. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which is a parent's role. \n\nBut the author did use harsh language (\"fuck off\"). That's a key point. While the intention was to protect the daughter, the method was aggressive. However, emotional situations can lead to strong reactions. The author's anger might be justified given the potential harm to their daughter's mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother might not have realized the impact of their words. But the daughter was clearly hurt, so the author's intervention was necessary. The question is whether the way the author handled it was wrong. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, people often weigh intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to stop the bullying of their daughter. The consequences were that the author upset their husband and mother but protected their daughter. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the primary responsibility is to protect a vulnerable child's mental health. The harsh words were a reaction to a harmful situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
