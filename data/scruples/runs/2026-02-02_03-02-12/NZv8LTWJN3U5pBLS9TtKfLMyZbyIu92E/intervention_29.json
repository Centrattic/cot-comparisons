We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their husband and mother for berating their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter moved back in after a bad breakup and has been working hard to improve her life\u2014getting a job, going to school, therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy, especially about her cat's litter box, in front of her. The daughter was upset, and the husband didn't apologize. The author, feeling the need to protect her daughter's mental health, lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off,\" then left with her daughter to get food and calm her down.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is public criticism of a vulnerable adult child who is already dealing with depression. The parents and husband's approach could be seen as insensitive, especially given the daughter's recent progress. The author's outburst, while strong, was in response to protect her daughter's feelings and self-esteem. The question is whether this reaction was justified or taken too far.\n\nIn these AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to defend her daughter, which is a protective instinct. The proportionality might depend on the context\u2014since the daughter was already struggling with mental health, the criticism from family could be harmful. The author might have felt that a more measured approach wouldn't have sufficed in the moment.\n\nHowever, the language used (\"fuck off\") is harsh, and some might argue that even though the intent was good, the method could have been better. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the public nature of the criticism, the author's reaction could be seen as a necessary intervention to prevent further harm.\n\nThe husband not apologizing is also a point. If he was venting in front of his daughter, that's part of the problem. The mother agreeing and continuing the criticism outside might have escalated the situation. The author's response was a direct way to stop the immediate negativity, which could be seen as justified given the stakes for the daughter's mental health.\n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), but I need to make sure. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable in the context. Since the daughter was emotional and the criticism was happening publicly and unapologetically, the mother's intervention, though strong, was to protect her child. The community usually supports protecting vulnerable family members from public shaming, even if the method was aggressive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
