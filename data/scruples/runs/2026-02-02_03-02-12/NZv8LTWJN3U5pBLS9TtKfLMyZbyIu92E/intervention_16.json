We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter after they criticized her for being messy and not taking care of her cat. The daughter was already struggling with depression and had made significant improvements, but the criticism from her family members made her feel bad and cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been overcoming a lot, and her family's public criticism might have been triggering. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which is a natural parental instinct. However, the method they used was yelling and telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off,\" which is harsh.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's intention was to defend their daughter's feelings and mental health, which is understandable. But the way they did it might have caused a rift in their relationships. The husband and mother didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which could be seen as their fault. The author's outburst was a reaction to that, but it's important to assess if their actions were proportionate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the line between protecting a loved one and overreacting can be thin. The author has a valid reason to be upset about the daughter's mental health, but using strong language might have exacerbated the situation. However, given the emotional context and the daughter's vulnerability, the author's actions could be seen as a justified reaction to protect their child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of how the author handled the conflict. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, they reacted with anger, which might not set a good example for their daughter. But considering the daughter's emotional state and the public nature of the criticism, the author felt compelled to act immediately to prevent further harm.\n\nI think the answer here hinges on whether the author's response was the best way to handle it. While yelling isn't ideal, the underlying issue of the daughter's mental health and the family members' public criticism is more concerning. The author might not be entirely in the wrong since they were trying to protect their daughter from harmful comments, even if their approach was aggressive.\n"
