We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, leading the writer to snap.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The daughter is doing well after a tough time, but there's a slob issue. The husband and mother-in-law discussed this in front of her, even bringing up the cat's litter box. The daughter was upset and felt attacked. The writer intervened, told them to stop or leave, and the family hasn't spoken since. The question is whether the writer is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the daughter is an adult with her own life, and while she's working hard, the parents might have a right to discuss housekeeping. But they did it in front of her and in a harsh way, adding insult by mentioning the cat. The daughter was already vulnerable due to her mental health. The husband not apologizing could have made it worse. The writer stepped in to protect her, which is a natural reaction when a loved one is being bullied. Yelling \"fuck off\" is strong, but the context is emotional. The writer might have felt that the criticism was harmful to the daughter's recovery. \n\nOn the other hand, using such language could be seen as disrespectful, even if the intent was protective. The writer might not have considered alternative ways to handle it, but the main issue is the public shaming of the daughter. The parents and husband might have overstepped, and the writer acted to defend her. The daughter's mental health is a significant factor here.\n\nSo, considering the daughter's progress and the public criticism, the writer's outburst was a reaction to protect her. While the language was harsh, the intent was to stop the negativity. Therefore, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong because the criticism from the others was inappropriate. The answer would be B (No).\n"
