We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a woman who has a daughter living with her and her husband. The daughter recently came out of a bad relationship and has been working on recovering from depression. She's doing well, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. But she's messy, which is a problem for her husband. The mother-in-law and husband criticized the daughter in front of her, which upset the daughter. The author then got angry and told them to fuck off, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health and the fact that the parents were publicly criticizing her. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which suggests she was trying to support her. The parents (husband and mother-in-law) were being harsh and didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The author then exploded, which is a strong reaction but in defense of her daughter.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public criticism from family members could set her back. The author's husband didn't apologize, which is concerning. The mother-in-law was complicit in the criticism, which adds to the stress on the daughter.\n\nThe author's outburst was in response to her daughter being attacked and not being supported. While using a strong curse word like \"fuck off\" is unprofessional and might come off as harsh, the intention was to protect her daughter. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn these situations, AITA often considers intent and context. The author's intent was to defend her daughter's mental health. The parents-in-law were being unkind and not considering the daughter's well-being. The author's actions were a reaction to protect her child, which is a valid concern. However, the method (using strong language) might be seen as excessive, but given the circumstances, it's a common reaction to frustration and fear.\n\nLooking at similar AITA cases, when someone intervenes to protect a vulnerable family member from public criticism, especially when the critics are not taking their words into account, the person defending is often not seen as the asshole. The parents' behavior in criticizing in front of the daughter and not apologizing is problematic. The author's reaction, while strong, was a direct response to protect her daughter's mental health.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents-in-law are in the wrong for their public criticism, and the author acted to protect her daughter. The author's outburst was a justified reaction given the circumstances.\n"
