We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, who's a mother and wife, has a daughter who recently moved in after a tough breakup and depression. The daughter has made significant progress\u2014getting a job, going back to school, therapy. The husband, however, is annoyed by her messiness, which the author thinks is due to her past depression. The mother-in-law visits, and both she and the husband criticize the daughter in front of her, specifically about her cat's litter box. The daughter gets upset, says she's a piece of shit. The author then snaps and tells her husband and mother to fuck off or leave. They haven't spoken since, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter is dealing with a lot, has made progress, but is being criticized by family members. The author intervened to protect her daughter's feelings. The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, the husband and mother's actions: they discussed the daughter's messiness in front of her, which is a sensitive topic. The daughter was already struggling with her mental health, and their comments led her to feel awful. The author's reaction was to defend her daughter. The husband didn't apologize, which might indicate he didn't consider his comments harmful. The author's outburst was a direct response to protect her child's mental health.\n\nThe daughter's mental health is a significant factor here. The author is trying to support her daughter, who is in a vulnerable state. The criticism from family could set her back. The author's anger seems justified given the context. The husband and mother might not have realized the impact of their words, especially given the daughter's history. The author's use of a strong phrase like \"fuck off\" might be seen as harsh, but the intent was to stop the negative comments immediately.\n\nThe author's main responsibility is to protect her daughter. The husband's venting in front of her daughter and the mother's agreement contributed to the daughter's emotional breakdown. While the author's language was extreme, the underlying action was protective. The husband's lack of apology also shows a lack of empathy. The author is in a tough position, trying to balance family dynamics and her daughter's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction, while intense, was a response to protect her daughter's mental health. The family members involved didn't seem to consider the daughter's feelings, which is a key point. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
