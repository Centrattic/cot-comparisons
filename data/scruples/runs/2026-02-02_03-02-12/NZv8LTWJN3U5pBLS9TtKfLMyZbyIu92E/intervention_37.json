We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after yelling at her husband and mother for berating her daughter in front of her. The situation involves a daughter recovering from depression, and the parents' criticism might have triggered a relapse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been doing well after a tough breakup and has a lot on her plate. Her parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, and the mother continued the criticism. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which led to her losing her temper.\n\nThe key points are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming, and the immediate emotional impact. The author's actions were in response to protect her child, which is a natural parental instinct. However, the method\u2014cursing and telling them to fuck off\u2014could be seen as harsh. But given the emotional stakes, maybe it's understandable. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, intent matters. The author's intent was to defend her daughter, not to be disrespectful. The husband and mother might have crossed a line by not considering the daughter's mental state. The author's outburst might be justified as a reaction to protect her child's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't address the situation calmly first. Maybe she could have handled it without yelling. But considering the daughter's emotional state and the ongoing criticism from both the husband and mother, her reaction might be a last resort to stop the hurt. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she prioritized her daughter's mental health. The real issue is the husband and mother not being considerate. So the answer should be B.\n"
