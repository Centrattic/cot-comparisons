We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter.\n\nSo the key points here: The daughter, who has clinical depression and has been making progress, is being criticized in front of her by the husband and mother. The parents are talking about her messiness and the cat's litter box. The daughter is upset, and the husband doesn't apologize. The author, in defense of their daughter, yells at the husband and mother, telling them to be respectful or \"fuck off.\" Then they take the daughter out to calm down. \n\nThe author is now feeling bad about losing their temper but is also worried about the daughter's mental health. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reacting that way.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The daughter is dealing with depression and has been making strides. Public criticism from family members could be damaging. The author intervened to protect their daughter's feelings. The husband and mother were berating the daughter in her presence, which is not supportive. The husband didn't apologize, so the author felt it was necessary to step in.\n\nThe author's reaction was a direct response to protect their daughter from further emotional harm. While the language used (\"fuck off\") is strong, it's a reaction to the parents' criticism and the daughter's distress. The author's actions were aimed at stopping the negative interaction and providing support to the daughter.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents (husband and mother) were likely the ones at fault for their behavior towards the daughter. The author's response, while perhaps harsh in wording, was a defense of their child's well-being. The daughter's mental health is a priority here, and the author acted to prevent further harm.\n\nHowever, the use of profanity and the outburst could be seen as reactive, maybe not the most effective communication. But given the emotional context, it's understandable. The author's primary motivation was to protect their daughter, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because they were defending their daughter from unkind treatment by family members, especially considering the daughter's mental health history.\n"
