We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So, they want me to analyze the scenario and decide between options A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a person who has a husband and mother. Their daughter is 26, moved in after a breakup, had depression, and is now doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The issue is the daughter's messiness, which the husband is annoyed by. The mother and husband discussed this in front of the daughter, leading to the daughter feeling hurt. The author then lost her temper and told them to fuck off or be respectful. Now, the family is upset, and the author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the daughter's mental health history, the public shaming by the husband and mother, and the author's reaction. The author's daughter was vulnerable, having been through depression, and the criticism from her father and grandmother could have been triggering. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which might be seen as justified given the daughter's fragile state.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, reacting with yelling and using harsh language (\"fuck off\") might be seen as extreme. However, the situation involved emotional harm to a daughter who was already struggling. The author's primary concern was protecting their daughter's mental health, which is a valid reason. The husband and mother, by bringing up the criticism in front of the daughter, might have been the initial wrongdoers. The author's outburst was in response to that, so it's a matter of whether the reaction was proportional.\n\nOn one hand, yelling and swearing isn't typically considered respectful or constructive. But on the other hand, the parent was defending their child against verbal abuse from other family members. The daughter's mental health is a significant factor here. If the mother and husband weren't respecting the daughter's boundaries or being supportive, the author's intervention makes sense.\n\nIn terms of social norms, family dynamics are complex. The author might be seen as standing up for their child, which is protective. However, the method of response was aggressive. But given the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter from further harm, it could be argued that the author's actions were justified, even if the words were harsh. The question is whether the wrong was in the outburst or in the initial criticism from the husband and mother.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on which action is considered more wrong. If the mother and husband are at fault for the initial berating, then the author's reaction is a justified stand-up. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong (B). However, some might argue that the author should have handled it more calmly. But given the daughter's mental health history, the author's protective response is understandable. So, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
