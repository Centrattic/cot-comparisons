We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story involves a family conflict where the author (a mother) yelled at her mother and husband for criticizing their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and was recently recovering. The mother and husband were talking about her messiness in front of her, which led to her crying. The daughter was already under a lot of stress with her job, school, and therapy. The author intervened when her in-laws and husband were being critical, leading to her outburst.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's intention was to protect her daughter's feelings and mental health. Her actions, while harsh, were a reaction to her loved ones' behavior that could harm the daughter. However, using a strong expletive like \"fuck off\" is certainly confrontational and might be seen as crossing a line, even if the motive was protective.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother were being disrespectful in a public setting, exacerbating the daughter's emotional state. The author's response could be justified as a necessary action to stop the emotional harm. However, the method used\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might not be the best approach in a family setting, even if the situation is tense.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at the intention versus the method, the intention was protective, but the method was aggressive. In many cases, people might empathize with the author's stance of defending her daughter, especially given the daughter's mental health history. However, the choice of words could be seen as inappropriate, leading to a rift in the family. \n\nBut the core issue is the protection of a vulnerable daughter. The author's reaction, while harsh, might be seen as a justified stand against family members who were contributing to the daughter's emotional distress. The author might not be in the wrong because the primary concern was her daughter's well-being. However, some might argue that the way she handled it was unconstructive.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might depend on cultural and personal values. If the focus is on protecting a child's mental health, the author's actions are understandable. If the focus is on the method and the respect in communication, then maybe she's in the wrong. But given the daughter's recent progress and the public shaming by the husband and mother-in-law, the author's intervention could be seen as necessary, even if the words were harsh. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), as the intent was to protect a loved one from emotional harm.\n"
