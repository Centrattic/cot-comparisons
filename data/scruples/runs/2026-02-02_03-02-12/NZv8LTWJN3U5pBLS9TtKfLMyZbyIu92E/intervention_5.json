We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband when they were criticizing her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter is 26, has been through a tough breakup and depression, and has been making progress. She's now working full-time, in school, and in therapy. The husband and mother criticize her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which the mother-in-law and husband say in front of her. The daughter is upset and even says she's a piece of shit. The author steps in, tells them to stop or leave, and takes her daughter to calm down. The husband doesn't apologize, and now they're all upset.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respecting the daughter's mental health and not belittling her in front of others. The author intervened to protect her daughter from further harm. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, and public criticism from family members could set her back. The husband and mother were being unkind and didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction was a response to protect her daughter's emotional well-being. While yelling might not be the ideal solution, the situation was about preventing emotional harm. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The author might have lost her temper, but the intent was protective. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother shouldn't have criticized the daughter in front of her, especially considering her history. The husband didn't apologize, which shows a lack of empathy. The mother's comments also contributed to the daughter's distress. \n\nSo, the author's actions were in defense of her daughter's mental health. The husband and mother were in the wrong for their public criticism. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
