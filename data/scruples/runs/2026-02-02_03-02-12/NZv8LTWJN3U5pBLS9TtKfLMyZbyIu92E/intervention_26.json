We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent whose daughter, who's 26 and has clinical depression, moved back in with them about a year ago. The daughter has made significant progress: she's working full-time, going to school, and in therapy. The author is proud and feels she's doing well. However, the daughter has become a bit messy, which is bothering the husband. The author is more lenient because the daughter has a lot on her plate.\n\nThen the mother visits, and during her stay, the husband and mother start discussing the daughter's messiness in front of her. The husband is venting, and the mother agrees. They bring up her cat, implying she's not taking care of it, which the author has been handling. The daughter gets upset and tells her dad he hurt her feelings, but he doesn't apologize. The author tries to comfort the daughter while the mother is outside. When the mother returns, they continue the criticism, leading the author to yell and tell them to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" and to have dinner without them. The author took the daughter to get food and calm down. Now, the parents and mother aren't talking to the author, and the author is feeling bad but also concerned about the daughter's mental health.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression and working hard. The parents are her support system, so their actions could affect her recovery. The husband and mother criticized the daughter in front of her, which is unkind, especially considering her mental health history. The daughter was already sensitive about her progress, and the public criticism led her to feel bad, even saying \"I'm a piece of shit.\" This shows that their words had a significant negative impact.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the husband and mother. The language used (\"fuck off\") was harsh, but the context is important. The daughter was being emotionally attacked, and the author stepped in to protect her. The author's intention was to defend the daughter's self-esteem, which is crucial during her recovery. While the wording might be considered rude, the action was motivated by a desire to shield their daughter from further harm.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of yelling, maybe they could have privately addressed the issue with the husband and mother, explaining the impact of their words on the daughter. But in the heat of the moment, when the daughter is clearly distressed, the author's immediate reaction was to put an end to the criticism to prevent further emotional damage.\n\nThe daughter's mental health is a key factor. If her parents and in-laws are making her feel negatively about herself, it could set back her progress. The author's concern is valid, and their intervention, while abrupt, was aimed at supporting their daughter. The husband and mother's behavior seems thoughtless, especially since they know the daughter's history. The husband didn't apologize when his remarks were hurting the daughter, which is a red flag. The mother's agreement and continuation of the criticism after the daughter was upset adds to the problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's core action was protecting their daughter from harm. While the choice of words might be considered harsh, the intent and the context (emotional distress of a recovering daughter) might justify it. The husband and mother's actions were the initial problem. The author's response, though not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to prevent further damage to the daughter's mental health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect their daughter. The husband and mother's behavior was the catalyst. The author's frustration is understandable given the daughter's vulnerable state. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
