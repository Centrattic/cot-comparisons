We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has been through a lot with depression and is making progress in her recovery. She moved in with her parents and is handling new responsibilities. The husband is frustrated with her messiness, which the mother agrees with. They talk about her in front of her, even bringing up the cat's litter box, which the author has been cleaning. The daughter is upset and says she's a piece of shit. The author then explodes, telling her mother and husband to fuck off or be respectful. Now, the family is upset, and the author is feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key factors here seem to be the daughter's mental health and the public criticism from the husband and mother. The husband and mother didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, which escalated the situation. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which is a protective instinct. However, the method used was aggressive language. \n\nOn one hand, the author was defending their daughter from verbal abuse, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as extreme. But given the context\u2014the daughter's mental health, the public shaming, and the lack of apology\u2014it's a reaction to protect their child. The author's actions were in defense of their daughter's well-being, even if the method was harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was justified. Since the husband and mother were in the wrong for criticizing the daughter in front of her, especially given her history with depression, the author stepping in was necessary. The author might have handled it differently, but the intent was to protect the daughter. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
