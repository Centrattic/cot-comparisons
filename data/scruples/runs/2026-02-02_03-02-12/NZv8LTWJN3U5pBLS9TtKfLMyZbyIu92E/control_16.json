We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, her husband, mother, and daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter, 26, is recovering from depression. She's working, going to school, and in therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the author thinks is due to her past depression. The mother and husband criticized her in front of her, specifically about the cat and her clutter. The daughter was upset, saying she's a piece of shit. The author lost her temper, told them to fuck off, and took the daughter out. Now, the mother and husband aren't talking to her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's main action was yelling at her mother and husband for being disrespectful to her daughter. The daughter was in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression, and the parents' public criticism could have triggered her feelings of self-worth. The author intervened to protect her daughter's mental health. \n\nBut, maybe the author could have handled it differently. However, given the context\u2014daughter's mental health is a priority, and the parents were being hurtful\u2014the author's reaction might be justified as a defense of her daughter. The husband not apologizing after hurting his daughter's feelings is a red flag. The mother and husband's behavior seems insensitive, especially in front of her. \n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language (\"fuck off\") might be seen as overreacting. But considering the emotional impact on the daughter and the ongoing stress, the author's outburst might be a result of stress and a desire to protect her child. The key is whether the parents' actions were more at fault. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the impact. The author's intent was to protect her daughter. The parents' intent was to criticize, which was harmful. So the author's reaction, while harsh, might be more about stopping further harm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because she stood up for her daughter's well-being against disrespectful criticism. The mother and husband's behavior is more in the wrong here.\n"
