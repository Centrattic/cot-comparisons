We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their husband and mother after they criticized their daughter in front of her, leading to the daughter feeling terrible. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter has depression and recently improved, but she's still dealing with a lot. The husband and mother-in-law criticized her messiness and the cat situation in front of her, which upset her. The author intervened by yelling at them to stop and told them to \"fuck off,\" then took the daughter to calm down. Now the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main ethical issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. Let's break it down. The daughter is vulnerable due to her mental health. Public criticism from family members in her presence could indeed trigger a setback. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter said he hurt her, which might indicate he wasn't considering her feelings. The mother-in-law was also berating her. The author's intervention was to stop the negativity to protect the daughter.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, protecting a loved one from emotional harm is a valid reason. The author's outburst, while harsh, was a response to immediate harm. However, using such strong language (\"fuck off\") might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good. But considering the context\u2014trying to shield their daughter from further mental health issues\u2014it could be seen as a necessary measure.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it more calmly. Maybe confronting them privately or using a different approach. But given the situation where the daughter was already crying and internalizing the criticism, the author's actions were a direct response to an ongoing issue. \n\nThe key here is the intent versus the method. The intent was protective and positive, while the method was confrontational. However, in situations where someone's mental health is at stake, the immediate reaction might be seen as justified. The author also took the daughter to comfort her afterward, showing they were trying to help.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (option B) because their action was a protective measure against further harm. The harsh language was a result of the emotional context, and the priority was the daughter's well-being.\n"
