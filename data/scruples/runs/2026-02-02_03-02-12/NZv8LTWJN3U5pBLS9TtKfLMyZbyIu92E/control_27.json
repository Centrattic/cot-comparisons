We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user's daughter, who's 26 and recovering from depression, moved in with them. She's doing well now, working, going to school, and therapy. But she's a bit messy, which the husband is annoyed about. The mother-in-law visited, and they started criticizing the daughter in front of her. The daughter was upset, cried, and felt bad about herself. The author then yelled at both her mother and husband to stop or \"fuck off.\" Now they're not talking to her, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in a tough situation with her mental health. The parents are pointing out her messiness, which the husband already knows she's working on. The author is defending her daughter, which is a good thing. The daughter was emotionally vulnerable, and being criticized in front of others could trigger her depression again. \n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the author's actions. She was protecting her daughter from further emotional harm. While using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as rude, the context is that her daughter was being emotionally attacked. The author's main goal was to stop the bullying or criticism towards her vulnerable daughter. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like calmly addressing the issue without yelling. But considering the daughter's mental state and the immediate emotional distress, the author's outburst was a reaction to protect her. It's a split between the tone of the response versus the intent. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole?) threads, the community often looks at intent and whether the person's actions were justified despite the harshness. Since the daughter was in a recovery phase, and the parents' criticism was harmful, the author's reaction is seen as a protective measure. So, the author is not in the wrong (B). They made a strong choice, but the intent was to shield their daughter, which is a valid reason.\n"
