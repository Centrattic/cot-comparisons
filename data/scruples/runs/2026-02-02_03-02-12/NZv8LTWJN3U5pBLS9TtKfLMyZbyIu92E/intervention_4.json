We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter's mental health, criticism from the husband and mother-in-law in front of the daughter, and the author's reaction of telling them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is dealing with clinical depression and has made significant progress. However, her husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of her cat in front of her, which upset her. The daughter started crying and felt like a \"piece of shit.\" The author intervened by yelling at both the husband and mother, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming by the husband and mother, and the author's reaction. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their daughter from further emotional harm.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, public shaming can be detrimental to someone's mental health, especially if they have a history of depression. The husband and mother's actions could potentially trigger a relapse. The author, acting as a parent, stepped in to defend their daughter, which is a protective instinct. While the language used was harsh (\"fuck off\"), the intent was to stop the harmful behavior, not just to be disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the author's method of expressing their frustration was confrontational. While understandable in the moment, it might not be the most effective way to handle the situation in the long term. The aftermath has caused a rift with both the husband and mother, but the author's primary concern was their daughter's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author's actions were driven by a desire to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. The criticism from the husband and mother was inappropriate given the daughter's mental state. However, the author could have handled it differently, perhaps by addressing the issue privately first. But in the heat of the moment, their reaction was a direct response to protect their child from immediate emotional harm.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author is more in the right because they prioritized their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother's public criticism was the initial wrongdoing. The author's response, though strong, was a necessary intervention in that context. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
