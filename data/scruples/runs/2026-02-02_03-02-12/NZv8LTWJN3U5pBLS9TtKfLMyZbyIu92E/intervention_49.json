We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's daughter who's recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her. The daughter was crying and feeling bad, and the author snapped, telling them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, the daughter has a lot going on\u2014new job, school, therapy. The messiness might be a symptom of her past depression, and the author is giving her the benefit of the doubt since she's under a lot of stress. The husband and mother-in-law brought up the mess and the cat's care in front of her, which was really hurtful. The daughter was already emotional, and they didn't apologize. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, which led to the confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the author's actions. The author was acting to protect their daughter's mental health. The daughter was already struggling and was made to feel like a failure in front of her family. The author's outburst was a reaction to seeing their child in emotional pain and the lack of support from the other two adults. While the language used was harsh, the motivation was to defend their daughter, especially during a vulnerable time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently\u2014maybe calmly addressing the issue without the harsh words. But considering the context, the immediate need to stop the hurtful comments and support the daughter might justify the reaction. The question is whether the means (yelling and using strong language) were appropriate. However, given the emotional stakes and the importance of the daughter's well-being, the author's actions seem driven by a protective instinct rather than malice.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to defend their daughter when others were being unkind, especially in a sensitive situation. The answer should be B.\n"
