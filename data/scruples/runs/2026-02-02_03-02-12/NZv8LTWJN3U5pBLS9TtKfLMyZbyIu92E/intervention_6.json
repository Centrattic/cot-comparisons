We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has been making progress. She moved back in with her parents and is now doing well with a job, school, and therapy. But her messiness is causing tension. The husband and mother are criticizing her in front of her, which leads to her emotional breakdown. The author steps in, yelling at them to stop, and now there's a rift.\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter is vulnerable, the parents are publicly criticizing her, leading to her emotional crisis. The author's reaction is to defend her daughter, which is a protective instinct. The husband and mother didn't apologize, which might have escalated the situation. The author's outburst was in response to the ongoing abuse and to protect her daughter's mental health.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, losing one's temper is never ideal, but the context is important. The daughter's mental health is at stake. The parents' criticism happened in front of her, which was hurtful and unkind. The author's action was to stop the bullying and support her daughter. While the method might have been harsh, the intent was protective. The alternative might have been letting the daughter feel worse, which could set her progress back.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Considering the situation, the author's actions were in defense of her daughter's well-being. The husband and mother were contributing to a toxic environment, so the author's response, though strong, was a reaction to protect their child. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
