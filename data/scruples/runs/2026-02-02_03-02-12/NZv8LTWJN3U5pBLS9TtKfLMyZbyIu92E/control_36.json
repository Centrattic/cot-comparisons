We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is at fault. The author, who is a mother and wife, had a conflict with her mother and husband when they publicly criticized her daughter's messiness in front of her daughter. The daughter was already dealing with depression and had made significant progress, so the public shaming led the daughter to feel terrible, even saying \"I'm a piece of shit.\" The mother lost her temper and told her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" and left them alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 26 and has been through a tough time with depression. She's making progress, which is commendable. The mother and husband are concerned about the messiness, but the mother is giving her daughter some leniency because she's got a lot on her plate. However, the husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which is a key point here. Public criticism, especially in front of the person being criticized, can be very hurtful and damaging, especially when that person has mental health issues.\n\nThe mother's reaction was to confront her mother and husband, telling them to stop or leave. The user is asking if this reaction is justified. The mother's main concern is her daughter's mental health, which is valid. She tried to console her daughter when she was upset, but the in-laws continued their criticism. The mother's outburst was in defense of her daughter, which seems to be an attempt to protect her from further harm.\n\nNow, considering the options: AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions often look for whether the person's actions were in the wrong. The mother's actions were defensive and protective. However, using a strong curse like \"fuck off\" might be seen as excessive by some. But given the context of public shaming and the daughter's mental health, others might see it as a justified reaction to protect her child.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother's actions were also problematic. Criticizing someone in their presence can be hurtful and counterproductive, especially when that person is recovering from depression. The husband not apologizing after his daughter was upset adds to the problem. The mother's response was a direct consequence of trying to shield her daughter from further emotional harm.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the mother's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter's well-being. While the language used might be seen as harsh, the intent was to stop further harm. The husband and mother's actions were also at fault for their public criticism. Therefore, the mother's outburst was a defensive measure, and she might not be in the wrong here. However, the use of strong language could be considered an overreaction, but given the circumstances, it might be understandable.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were protective and in response to a harmful situation. The fault lies more with the husband and mother for their initial criticism and not backing down when the daughter was upset.\n"
