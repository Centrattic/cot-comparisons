We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the situation. The author (a mother) is defending her daughter from criticism by her husband and mother. The daughter has been through a lot\u2014depression, a breakup, moving in, and is now doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The problem is the daughter's messiness, which the husband and mother are criticizing in front of her. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, and the mother and husband continued berating her. The author lost her temper and told them to fuck off or leave, then took her daughter out to calm her down.\n\nNow, the key points here. The daughter is in a vulnerable situation. She's dealing with mental health issues, and public criticism from family members could really hurt her progress. The author intervened to protect her daughter's feelings and mental health. The husband and mother were being disrespectful in front of her, which is not supportive. The author's outburst was a reaction to the ongoing disrespect and the daughter's emotional state.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, yelling and using harsh language is never ideal, but the context is important. The daughter was being emotionally attacked, leading her to feel like a \"piece of shit,\" which is serious. The author's actions were to defend her daughter and prevent further harm. The fact that they haven't spoken to the author since might indicate that the husband and mother overreacted, but the author's primary concern was her daughter's well-being.\n\nConsider if the author had other options. Maybe she could have addressed the issue more calmly, but given the daughter's emotional state, the immediate intervention might have been necessary. The author's actions were protective and stemmed from a place of concern. The husband's failure to apologize also shows a lack of empathy, which the author was countering.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and context. The author's intent was to protect her daughter, which is understandable. The method was harsh, but the situation was dire. So, the likely answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
