We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband. The situation involves her daughter, who's dealing with depression and has made significant progress. The daughter's messiness is being criticized by the husband and mother-in-law in front of her, which leads to the daughter feeling awful. The author steps in and tells them to respect her daughter or leave, which caused a fallout.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in a vulnerable state. She's working hard to recover, and public criticism from family members could set her back. The author's intervention was to protect her daughter's mental health. Even though the author used strong language (\"fuck off\"), the context is a heated moment where the daughter is emotionally hurting. The author's actions were a reaction to protect her child, which is a natural parental instinct.\n\nThe husband and mother might feel that pointing out the messiness is constructive, but doing it in front of the daughter without considering the emotional impact was unkind. The author's outburst, while not ideal, was driven by a desire to shield her daughter from further harm. The fact that the author hasn't reached out since might indicate she's still upset, but the core issue is the daughter's well-being. \n\nSo, considering the daughter's mental health and the immediate emotional distress caused by her family, the author's reaction, though harsh, was in defense of her child. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
