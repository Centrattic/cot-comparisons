We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and husband to fuck off after they criticized her daughter in front of her. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, and the parents (husband and mother) are pointing out her messiness and the cat's care in front of her, leading to the daughter feeling awful. The author stepped in and lost her temper.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The daughter is making progress in her recovery, which is commendable. The husband and mother criticized her publicly, which is unkind and could harm her mental health. The mother-in-law and husband were being judgmental, and the husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which is a protective act.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to react that way. From an emotional standpoint, protecting a vulnerable family member from public shaming is understandable. The daughter was already struggling, and the parents' comments could set her back. The author's outburst might be seen as a necessary boundary to stop further harm.\n\nHowever, the method of communication was harsh. Using \"fuck off\" is aggressive, which might be seen as inappropriate in some contexts. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the ongoing criticism from the husband and mother-in-law, the author's reaction could be justified as a last resort to stop the negative interaction.\n\nAlso, the author had never spoken to them like that before, indicating that this was a significant escalation due to the circumstances. The aftermath of no communication might be a point against the author, but the immediate harm of the parents' actions could weigh more heavily.\n\nIn terms of social norms, public criticism of someone's habits, especially when they're recovering from depression, is generally frowned upon. The author's defense of her daughter is in line with supporting her recovery, which is a positive action. The anger comes from a place of protecting her daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter from harmful criticism. While the language was strong, the intent was to stop emotional harm. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
