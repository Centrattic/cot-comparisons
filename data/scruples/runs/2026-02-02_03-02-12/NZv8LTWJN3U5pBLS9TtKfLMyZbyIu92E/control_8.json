We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter. The daughter is 26, recovering from depression, working, going to school, and has a cat. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which is a change since her depression. The mother and husband talked about this in front of the daughter, criticized her for not taking care of the cat, and didn't apologize when the daughter got upset. The author stood up for her daughter by yelling at them to stop or leave. Now the family is upset, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the daughter is in a sensitive position, recovering from mental health issues. Public criticism from family members, especially in front of others, can be really damaging. The author's reaction was to protect their daughter, which seems like a natural response to prevent further harm.\n\nThe husband and mother were venting in front of the daughter, which isn't appropriate. Even if the daughter is a bit messy, the way they addressed it\u2014publicly shaming her\u2014could exacerbate her mental health. The author intervened to stop the bullying, which is a parent's role. Yelling in the moment might be harsh, but the intent was to protect.\n\nThe author feels bad about losing their temper, but also justified in defending their daughter. The question is whether the author is wrong. Considering the context, the author's action was to protect a vulnerable family member. The husband and mother's behavior was the initial problem. So the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
