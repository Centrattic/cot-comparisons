We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her mother and husband for berating her daughter in front of her. The key points here are about the daughter's mental health, the parents' behavior, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a lot: a bad relationship, depression, but she's improving. The daughter is now working, in school, and in therapy. The mother and husband are criticizing her for being a slob and not taking care of the cat. The daughter is already vulnerable, and being criticized by her family might trigger a setback. \n\nThe parents, both the husband and mother, are talking about this in front of the daughter. The daughter is upset, and the husband doesn't apologize. The mother continues the criticism even after the daughter is emotional. The author steps in, yells at them, and tells them to fuck off or leave. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, using such strong language is unkind and might be seen as harsh. But on the other hand, the parents were being unkind to a family member with mental health issues. The author is defending their daughter's well-being. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. The parents were being hurtful, and the daughter was in emotional distress. The author intervened to stop the bullying, even if the method was aggressive. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The author's reaction might have been a last resort after the parents didn't stop. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents also share some fault for their behavior. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect the daughter. So, even though the language used was strong, the intent was to stop harm. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they were defending someone vulnerable. The answer would likely be No (B).\n"
