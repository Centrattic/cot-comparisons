We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression and has made significant progress since moving in with her parents. She's working, in school, and in therapy. The main issue is her messiness, which the husband is bothered by, but the mother-in-law and husband criticized her in front of her when the mother-in-law was visiting. The daughter was hurt and started crying, feeling like everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. The author (the mother) then told her mother-in-law and husband to either be respectful or \"fuck off\" and left with the daughter.\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter is vulnerable due to her mental health, and the parents are criticizing her in a public way during a visit. The daughter's self-esteem is already fragile, and being criticized by family in front of others could push her back into depression. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which seems like a natural response to prevent further harm. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother-in-law continued the criticism. The author's outburst was a direct reaction to protect her child's mental health.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The question is whether her response was justified. The parents were being disrespectful in public, and the author intervened to stop the emotional harm. While yelling and using strong language might not be the most diplomatic approach, the intent was to protect her daughter. The alternative would be letting the criticism continue, which could have been harmful. So, the author's actions, though harsh, were a response to a harmful situation. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), because the primary responsibility is to support a child's mental health, especially when they're vulnerable.\n"
