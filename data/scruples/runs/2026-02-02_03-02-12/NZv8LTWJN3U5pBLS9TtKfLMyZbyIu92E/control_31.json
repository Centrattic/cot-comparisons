We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, leading the author to yell at them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The daughter is 26, back in school, working full-time, and in therapy. She's been struggling with being a slob, which her husband and mother criticized in front of her. The daughter was already vulnerable, crying, and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The author intervened by telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off,\" which is pretty strong language.\n\nThe key points here are about the daughter's mental health. The author's main concern is protecting her daughter's emotional state. Public shaming, especially when someone is in recovery, can be detrimental. The husband and mother were being critical without considering the daughter's situation. The author stepped in to stop the negative comments, which might be seen as defending her daughter's well-being.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction was yelling and using harsh language. That could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was good. Family relationships can be sensitive, so using such strong words might cause lasting hurt. But the alternative is allowing the daughter to be emotionally harmed by her family, which could set back her recovery.\n\nI need to balance intent versus action. The author's intention was to protect her daughter, which is a valid and caring motive. But the method of intervention was aggressive. However, considering the context of the daughter's mental health, the author might feel that the immediate action was necessary to prevent further harm.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the husband and mother were the ones who started the criticism, the author's reaction could be a justified defense. But does that make the author right? It's a gray area. On one hand, defending a vulnerable family member. On the other, using harsh language that could damage relationships.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the intent to protect outweighs the method used. Since the daughter's mental health is a priority, and the parents-in-law were contributing to her distress, the author's reaction might be seen as a protective measure. But some might argue that there are better ways to handle the situation without escalating it.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to prevent emotional harm to their daughter. The harsh language is unfortunate, but the underlying motivation is protective. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
