We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter recovering from depression, a husband criticizing her messiness, the mother-in-law joining in, and the author losing their temper to defend their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been through a lot, overcoming depression, getting a job and going to school. Her parents-in-law publicly criticized her in front of her, which really hurt her. The author stepped in to defend her by yelling and telling them to \"fuck off.\" \n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health and the public shaming by the husband and mother-in-law. The author's reaction was a response to protect their child from emotional harm. While yelling might not be the best approach, the intention was to shield the daughter from further distress. The husband not apologizing adds to the tension. \n\nThe question is whether the author's action was wrong. On one hand, using harsh language isn't ideal. On the other hand, the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter from harmful criticism is crucial. The author might have felt that they had no other choice to prevent their daughter's mental health from deteriorating. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author's action was a reaction to protect their child, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. However, the harsh language could be seen as problematic, but given the situation, it's a justified reaction to a harmful scenario.\n"
