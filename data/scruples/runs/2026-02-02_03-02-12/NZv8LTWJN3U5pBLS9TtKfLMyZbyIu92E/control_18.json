We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for telling their mother and husband to fuck off. The situation involves their daughter's mental health, criticism from the husband and mother, and the mother-in-law's involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 26, has clinical depression, and has made significant progress by getting a job, going back to school, and seeing therapy. The husband and mother criticize her for being a slob and not taking care of the cat, which they do in front of her. The daughter is emotionally hurt, and the author steps in, yelling at them.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health and the public shaming by the husband and mother. The author's outburst was in defense of their daughter. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism even after the daughter is upset might have escalated the situation. The author's action, while harsh, was to protect their daughter from further emotional harm. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband and mother were disrespectful by criticizing in front of her, and the author reacted to defend their child. However, using such strong language (\"fuck off\") might be seen as crossing a line, but the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter could mitigate that. The author's primary responsibility is to their daughter's well-being, so their reaction might be understood as a protective measure. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they intervened to stop further harm to their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother's behavior was the initial issue. So the answer is B (No).\n"
