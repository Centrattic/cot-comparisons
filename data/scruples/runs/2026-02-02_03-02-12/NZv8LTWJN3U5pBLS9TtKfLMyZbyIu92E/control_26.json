We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the daughter, who's 26 and dealing with depression, moved in with her parents. She's been improving a lot, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. The husband and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being a slob and not taking care of her cat. They did this in front of her, which upset her, leading the author to lose her temper and tell them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is her daughter's mental health. The daughter was already in a vulnerable state with depression, and public criticism from family members could really set her back. The mother and husband didn't apologize, which probably made the situation worse. The author intervened when she saw her daughter breaking down, which shows she's trying to protect her.\n\nBut was the way she did it right? Yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as over the top. However, considering the context\u2014her daughter was being emotionally attacked and not offered support\u2014it could be seen as a justified reaction to defend her child's dignity. The mother and father's behavior was inconsiderate, especially since they were aware of the daughter's struggles. They brought up the cat and messiness in a way that was hurtful, not constructive.\n\nThe author did cut off communication afterward, which might not be the best approach for resolving the conflict, but her immediate reaction was in defense of her daughter. The key points here are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming by family, and the lack of support from the husband and mother. The author's anger stems from a place of wanting to protect her daughter from further harm. So, while the method might not be ideal, the intent was protective. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author was defending her daughter against harmful criticism.\n"
