We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband and mother after they criticized her daughter in front of her, which upset the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has a history of depression and is currently working on improving her life. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which led to emotional distress. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which is a protective instinct. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: Was there a breach of trust or respect in how the husband and mother approached the situation? The parents were discussing the daughter's messiness and her cat care in front of her, which is unkind and could be seen as a public humiliation, especially given the daughter's mental health history. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which adds to the problem. The mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was crying.\n\nThe author's reaction was to yell and tell them to be respectful or leave. While yelling might be seen as harsh, the intent was to defend her daughter from further harm. The daughter was in a vulnerable state, and the author had a responsibility to protect her mental health. \n\nHowever, the author hasn't reached out to reconcile with her husband and mother, which might be necessary for family harmony. But the initial question is about being in the wrong, not about the aftermath. The core issue is whether the author was justified in her reaction. Since the parents were contributing to the daughter's emotional pain, the author's intervention was likely a protective measure rather than an overreaction. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the parents were being unkind and the author acted to protect her child's well-being.\n"
