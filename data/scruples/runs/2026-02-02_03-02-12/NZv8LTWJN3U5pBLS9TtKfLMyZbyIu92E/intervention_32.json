We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a mother, wife, and has a 26-year-old daughter who moved back in with them after a tough breakup and depression. The daughter has been doing really well recently\u2014getting a job, going to school, therapy. So the daughter is making progress, which the mom is proud of. The husband, though, is bothered by the daughter's messiness, which the mom thinks is a habit from when she was depressed, and she gives her a pass because she has a lot on her plate.\n\nThen the mom's mother (the grandmother) visits. The husband and grandmother start talking about the daughter's messiness in front of her. They also bring up her cat's litter box, which the author has been cleaning. They both criticize the daughter. The daughter gets upset, tells her dad he hurt her feelings, but he doesn't apologize. The mom tries to console her daughter, but the mother and husband keep going. The daughter is crying and saying she's a piece of shit. The mom then yells at both of them to be respectful or else they can have dinner alone. The mom takes the daughter out to calm down, and now neither the mother nor husband have spoken to her since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, trying to recover from depression. Public criticism from her father and grandmother could be a setback. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which is a big no-no in many parenting or family advice contexts. The mom intervened to protect her daughter's feelings, which seems like a positive action.\n\nHowever, the mom's response was to yell at her mother and husband, telling them to fuck off. That's a strong reaction. While the intent was protective, the method might be seen as harsh. But given the context\u2014her daughter's mental health is at risk, and the criticism was happening in front of her\u2014it's understandable. The husband not apologizing after hurting the daughter's feelings is part of the problem too.\n\nSo, is the mom in the wrong? Well, she acted to protect her daughter, which is a parent's role. The criticism was happening in a public setting, which is more hurtful. The daughter was already emotionally fragile. The mom's outburst was a reaction to protect her child's mental health. While the language used was strong, the intent was to stop the abuse and support her daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it differently. But considering the urgency of the situation and the daughter's emotional state, her response was a defense mechanism. The husband and mother's behavior was inappropriate, so the mom's reaction, while harsh, was in response to their behavior.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
