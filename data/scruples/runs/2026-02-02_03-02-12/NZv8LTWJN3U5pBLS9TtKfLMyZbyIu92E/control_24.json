We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law criticizing her for being messy in front of her, leading to an emotional outburst from the author.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 26, has a job, is in school, and in therapy. She's making progress after a breakup and depression. The husband and mother are criticizing her messiness and her inability to take care of her cat. The author, the mother-in-law, lost her temper and told them to fuck off. Now, the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's mental health history, the public criticism by the husband and mother, the daughter's emotional response, and the author's reaction. \n\nI think the author's main concern is protecting their daughter's mental health. The daughter was already vulnerable, and the criticism from her father and mother might have triggered her. The author stepped in to defend her, which is a natural response when a loved one is being unfairly criticized. The husband didn't apologize, which probably made things worse. The mother-in-law and husband's continued criticism despite the daughter's visible distress is problematic. \n\nThe author's outburst was a result of frustration and wanting to protect their child. While the language was harsh (\"fuck off\"), the intent was protective. However, the author might need to consider whether there's a better way to handle such situations in the future, but in this specific case, the criticism from the husband and mother was out of line. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They were defending their daughter's emotional well-being against judgmental comments, especially considering her mental health struggles. The husband and mother were the ones being harsh without considering the daughter's situation.\n"
