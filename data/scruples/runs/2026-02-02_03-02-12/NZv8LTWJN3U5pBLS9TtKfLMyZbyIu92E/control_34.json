We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The scenario involves a conflict where the daughter is dealing with depression and has a slobbish habit, which the husband and mother criticized in front of her. The author lost their temper and told them to \"fuck off\" or leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is recovering from depression and has a lot going on\u2014new job, school, therapy. Her parents' criticism could be really hurtful. The daughter was already emotional and felt like a \"piece of shit.\" The author stepped in to protect her, which shows they care about her well-being.\n\nBut was the author wrong to lash out? They used strong language (\"fuck off\"), which is aggressive. However, the situation was emotionally charged. The mother and husband were berating the daughter, which isn't good. The author's outburst might be seen as a reaction to protect the daughter's mental health. \n\nOn one hand, using harsh language isn't ideal and could damage relationships. On the other hand, the author was defending their daughter from public humiliation during a vulnerable time. The key factors are the intent behind the action and the context. The author's primary concern was their daughter's well-being, which is valid. The mother and husband, however, shouldn't have criticized her in front of her either.\n\nSo, in this case, the author's action was a response to protect their daughter from harmful criticism. While the language was harsh, the underlying motivation was to prevent harm. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
