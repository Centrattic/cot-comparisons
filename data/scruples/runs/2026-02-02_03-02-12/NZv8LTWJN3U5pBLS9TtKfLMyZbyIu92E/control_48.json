We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict where the author confronts their mother and husband after they criticize their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter has a history of depression and is making progress in her recovery. The husband and mother criticize her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which is done in front of the daughter. The daughter is upset and starts crying, feeling like everyone thinks she's a \"piece of shit.\" The author steps in, tells the mother and husband to either be respectful or \"fuck off,\" and then takes the daughter to get food and calm down. Now the mother and husband aren't talking to the author, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main question is: Was the author wrong to confront the mother and husband in that way?\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author's daughter was being criticized in a public and hurtful manner, which could negatively impact her mental health. The author intervened to protect the daughter, which might be seen as a justified reaction given the daughter's vulnerability. The author mentions the daughter's progress in overcoming depression, so maintaining a supportive environment is crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, the author used harsh language (\"fuck off\") and cut off communication with the mother and husband. While the intent was to protect the daughter, the method involved a direct confrontation that might have been handled differently. The husband and mother were in the wrong for their criticism, but the author's response might have been more aggressive than necessary. However, emotions can run high in such situations, and the immediate concern was the daughter's well-being.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent behind the author's action and the context. The author's primary goal was to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. The method of confrontation, while harsh, was a direct response to an immediate threat to the daughter's emotional state. Considering the daughter's history with depression, the author might have felt that a firm stand was necessary to prevent further harm.\n\nHowever, the author could have handled the situation in a less confrontational way, such as addressing the issue privately with the husband or mother afterward. But given the emotional intensity and the daughter's visible distress, the author's reaction might be seen as a necessary defense of their child.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's language was strong, the action was motivated by a desire to protect their daughter. The mother and husband were at fault for the initial criticism, so the author's response, though harsh, was a reaction to a harmful situation. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
