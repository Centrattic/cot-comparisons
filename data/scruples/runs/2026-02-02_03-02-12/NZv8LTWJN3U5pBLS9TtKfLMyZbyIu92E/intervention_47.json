We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter. \n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression and has been making significant progress. The husband is annoyed by her messy habits, which the author thinks is understandable given the daughter's workload. However, the mother and husband publicly criticized the daughter in front of her, which led the daughter to feel awful. The author then lost their temper and told them to fuck off.\n\nI need to consider the key points. The daughter's mental health is a big factor here. Public criticism from family can be really damaging, especially for someone with a history of depression. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which seems like a good intention. But did they overreact? The husband and mother were both involved in the criticism, and the author's response was to cut them off completely, not even trying to reach out since.\n\nOn one hand, standing up for a vulnerable family member is understandable. The daughter was visibly upset, and the parents' comments might have triggered a setback. The author's anger comes from a place of wanting to protect their child. However, the way they expressed it was aggressive, using a strong insult. That could be seen as impulsive. But given the context of the daughter's mental state, maybe the author felt it was necessary.\n\nThe husband not apologizing when the daughter was hurt is another point. The mother joined in instead of stopping the conversation. The author's actions might be justified as a last resort to stop the harm. \n\nBut the author hasn't reached out to mend the relationship, which might show a lack of accountability. However, they do feel bad about losing their temper. The main issue is the public shaming of the daughter, which the author prevented further by removing her. \n\nSo weighing intentions and context, the author's actions were to protect their daughter from emotional harm. While the method was harsh, the underlying motivation is protective. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
