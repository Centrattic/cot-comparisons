We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about her daughter, who's been through a tough time with depression but is now doing better. The daughter moved in with her parents, and the husband is annoyed by her messiness. The mother-in-law comes to visit, and during the visit, the husband and mother start criticizing the daughter in front of her, even bringing up her cat and the fact that the author has been cleaning it. The daughter gets upset and starts crying, feeling like everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. The author then yells at them and tells them to be respectful or fuck off, which leads to a rift.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's mental health is fragile, she's improving, but her father and grandmother are criticizing her in front of her. The daughter's reaction is emotional, which the author tries to comfort. The author then stands up for her daughter by confronting the husband and mother, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom my perspective, the parents' actions seem to be part of the problem. Criticizing someone who's already struggling with mental health, especially in front of them, is not supportive. The daughter's emotional response is a result of that criticism. The author's reaction, while intense, is in defense of their daughter's emotional well-being. They took the daughter away to comfort her, which shows concern. The husband and mother's refusal to apologize or back down might have escalated the situation. \n\nHowever, the author did use harsh language (\"fuck off\"), which could be seen as crossing a line. But considering the context\u2014trying to protect their daughter from further harm\u2014it's a reaction driven by a desire to shield her from hurtful comments. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like calmly addressing the issue instead of yelling. But given the circumstances, the immediate need to protect the daughter from emotional damage might justify the outburst. The question is whether the means (yelling) were justified by the intent (protecting mental health). \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband and mother initiated the hurtful behavior, so they share some fault. The author's response, while strong, was in reaction to their actions. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They might have handled it better, but their intent was to protect their daughter. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
