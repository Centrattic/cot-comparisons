We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is dealing with a daughter who's recovering from depression and has a lot going on. The daughter moved in with them and has been making progress. The husband is annoyed with her messiness, which the author understands given her daughter's workload. The mother-in-law visits, and during the visit, the husband and mother talk about the daughter's messiness in front of her. They even mention the cat's litter box, which the author has been cleaning. The daughter gets upset, tells her dad he hurt her feelings, but he doesn't apologize. The author comforts her while the in-laws keep berating her. The author then loses their temper, tells them to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" and takes the daughter out. Now the in-laws aren't speaking to them, and the author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue here. The main problem is the public criticism of the daughter by her father and grandmother, which is affecting her mental health. The author's reaction was to defend their daughter. The question is whether the author overstepped by losing their temper.\n\nThe daughter is in a vulnerable state, coming out of depression, and the public shaming by her father and grandmother could set her back. The author's primary concern is her mental health. The husband and mother's behavior seems to be undermining the daughter, which is counterproductive to her recovery. The author's response, while harsh, was a direct reaction to protect the daughter from emotional harm. \n\nThe key factors here are: the daughter's mental health, the public nature of the criticism, and the lack of apology from the husband. The author's outburst was in defense of their daughter. While yelling and using strong language isn't ideal, the underlying motive was protective. The husband's failure to apologize is also a problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are driven by a desire to protect their child. The in-laws' behavior is the root issue here. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the method of confrontation could be debated. But given the circumstances, the intent and the daughter's well-being are on the author's side. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
