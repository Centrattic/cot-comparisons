We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter. \n\nFirst, the daughter moved back home after a tough breakup and has been struggling with depression. She's made a lot of progress: job, school, therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the author thinks is understandable given her workload. The mother visits, and both the husband and mother criticize the daughter in front of her, specifically about the cat's litter box. The daughter gets upset, and the husband doesn't apologize. The author loses their temper, tells them to fuck off, and takes the daughter out. Now, the author is in a state of not talking to the others and is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter is recovering from depression and has a lot going on. Public criticism from family members could be damaging. The author intervened to protect the daughter's feelings and mental health. The husband didn't apologize, which might reflect poorly on him. The mother and husband's actions seem to have been the initial problem. The author's reaction was a response to protect their daughter.\n\nBut is the author wrong for reacting that way? Well, the daughter's mental health is a priority. If the parents weren't supporting her recovery, that's a problem. The author's outburst was in defense of their daughter. However, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as extreme. But given the context of the daughter's emotional state and the public criticism, maybe it's justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the balance of responsibility. The husband and mother started the issue by criticizing the daughter in a hurtful way. The author's reaction was a response to protect their child. While the language was strong, the intent was protective. The author might have handled it differently, but the underlying issue is the others' behavior. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No), because they stood up for their daughter against the other two's harmful comments. But maybe some would argue that the author overreacted. However, given the daughter's mental health, the author's action could be seen as justified. So probably the answer is B.\n"
