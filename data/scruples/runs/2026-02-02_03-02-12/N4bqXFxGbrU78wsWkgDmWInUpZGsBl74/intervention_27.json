We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. The situation involves a girlfriend who, during her period, doesn't want to do anything and cancels plans, which the author finds frustrating. He planned a special date night, but she canceled, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author points out that he's aware periods can be uncomfortable and that he usually puts up with it. However, in this specific instance, he felt justified in his reaction because he had planned this in advance and she knew about it. He mentions that other women he's lived with don't act this way, which adds to his frustration. But when he expressed this, his girlfriend reacted extremely emotionally, leading to a major fallout.\n\nFrom the author's side, he might feel that communication was lacking. He had made the plans with notice, and she canceled last minute despite knowing. He might feel that she didn't consider his effort or the significance of the plans. However, the key issue here is his comparison to other women. Even if he's not being aggressive, bringing up past experiences with other women can be hurtful and dismissive of his current partner's feelings and experiences. It implies that his current partner isn't meeting expectations set by others, which is unfair and invalidating.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She locked herself in her room and had a significant emotional outburst. This suggests that the comment about other women hit a nerve. Period-related discomfort is real for many women, and even if the author knows this, his words might have made her feel criticized or not supported. Comparing her to other women could make her feel like her pain isn't valid or that she's failing as a partner. \n\nThe author's approach was passive-aggressive but crossed a line by referencing others. This could make the girlfriend feel attacked, especially since she's already in a vulnerable state during her period. The fact that she didn't communicate her period earlier might be a factor, but the author's response was to criticize her effort, which isn't constructive. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues without comparisons. The author could have expressed his disappointment about the canceled plans without bringing up other women. Additionally, there's a communication gap here. The author might not have considered how his words would land, especially during a time when his partner is already feeling unwell. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling criticized for something beyond her control. \n\nSo, while the author's frustration is understandable given the effort he put into planning, his method of expressing that frustration was inappropriate. He's in the wrong for using a comparison to other women, which invalidated his partner's feelings and experiences. The correct answer here is A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
