We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is upset with their girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. He plans a special date night, but she backs out at the last minute because she's on her period. He tells her that other women he's lived with don't act like this, implying she should try harder. She gets really upset and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he had plans that he worked hard to set up, and he was hurt that she canceled. He was trying to be understanding, but he felt she wasn't making an effort. On the other hand, the girlfriend is dealing with her period, which can be physically and emotionally taxing. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings\u2014these are real issues. His comment about other women might come off as dismissive of her experience.\n\nSo, is it fair to compare her to other women? Comparing someone's experience to others is usually a bad move. It can make the person feel invalidated. Even if his intention wasn't to be harsh, the statement likely made her feel like her pain wasn't acknowledged. The fact that she reacted so strongly suggests that he crossed a line, even if it was passive-aggressive and not angry. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that her period comes at a \"semi-random time every month,\" which he knows. He might have tried to plan around it, but maybe he's expecting her to adjust for him more than she's comfortable with. Relationships require compromise, but it's about mutual respect. If he's pressuring her to do something when she's in pain, that's not healthy. \n\nHe says he's just a \"weeny bit\" justified, but even a little bit of implying she's not trying hard enough can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized and dismissed. The key here is empathy. Instead of comparing her to others, he should have validated her feelings and maybe suggested an alternative plan that works for both of them. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment, while perhaps not screamed in anger, was a judgment of her experience. That's likely why she was so upset. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
