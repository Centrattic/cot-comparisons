We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with their girlfriend for not wanting to go out when she's on her period. The key points here are about communication, expectations, and sensitivity.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is on her period and experiences discomfort, which is a common experience for many women. The author mentions she's been living with her for three months and knows about her periods, but she still plans a date night without considering that her period might come on that day. Wait, actually, the problem here is the author made plans despite knowing her period is unpredictable. The girlfriend cancels, and the author expresses frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not trying hard enough. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe author's comment about other women not acting like this is problematic. It's a comparison that can invalidate her feelings and experience. Even if the author didn't say it angrily, the passive-aggressive tone might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might feel disrespected or not supported during a time when she's already dealing with physical discomfort.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author should have considered her feelings and perhaps adjusted the plans if they knew she was having a tough time. Instead of making a passive-aggressive remark, he could have expressed his feelings without invalidating hers. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows that the situation escalated, partly because of his comment.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of pointing out that other women don't act this way could be seen as minimizing her experience. Every woman's body is different, and pain levels vary. It's not about comparing but supporting each other's unique situations. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was inappropriate.\n\nIn summary, the author's comment was hurtful and dismissive of his girlfriend's needs. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity it required.\n"
