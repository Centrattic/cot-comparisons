We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out during her period.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The girlfriend experiences severe symptoms during her period for the first two days, which makes her cancel plans. The author plans a special date night, which she cancels because her period started that day. He then tells her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she's not making enough effort. This leads to her emotional outburst.\n\nThe core issue here is communication and expectations. The author expected her to make an effort despite her period, but she's experiencing discomfort. He mentioned that she knew about the plans in advance, but her period timing is irregular. The problem arises when he compares her to other women, which can come off as dismissive of her experience. \n\nCramps and period symptoms can be debilitating for some people. The author's comment about other women not acting this way might invalidate her feelings. Even if he didn't mean it angrily, the passive-aggressive remark could have hurt her. She reacted strongly because she felt criticized for her natural bodily experience.\n\nHe should have considered her needs and maybe found a compromise instead of expressing frustration. The fact that she rarely cries and was so upset shows how much this affected her. The author didn't acknowledge her pain and instead focused on his own plans, which might be why he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
