We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The key points here are communication and empathy.\n\nThe author planned a special date night, which the girlfriend had known about weeks in advance. However, when her period started that day, she wanted to cancel. The author then made a comment comparing her behavior to other women he's lived with, implying she should put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, which led to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Menstrual pain can be severe for some women, and it's a legitimate health issue. The author acknowledges that she experiences cramps but seems frustrated that it affects their plans. However, the author's comment about other women not acting that way, even during their periods, could be seen as dismissive of her experience. Comparing her to others might invalidate her feelings and suggest that her pain isn't valid if other women \"handle it\" better. That's a common trigger for defensiveness or anger.\n\nThen there's the timing. The author had planned this date for weeks, and the girlfriend knew about it. But her period started that day. Even if she had scheduled it, maybe she couldn't have predicted when her period would start. The author mentions that her periods come at semi-random times, which complicates things. However, the girlfriend did cancel, which the author found frustrating.\n\nThe author's comment was passive-aggressive, which might have escalated the situation. Instead of expressing his feelings in a constructive way, he made a comparison that could be seen as critical. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve, possibly because she felt unappreciated or judged. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he addressed it might have been hurtful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some role here. The girlfriend could have communicated her needs better or discussed the possibility of rescheduling if she knew she was about to get her period. On the other hand, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, acknowledging her discomfort without comparing her to others. The author's comment, even if not angry, still came across as dismissive, which is a key factor in whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because his comment was dismissive and contributed to the conflict. Even if he was upset, the way he expressed it was not supportive, which is crucial in a relationship.\n"
