We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months, and she often cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. He usually puts up with it, but one time he planned a special date night, and she canceled because she started her period that day. He mentioned to her that other women he's known don't act this way during their periods, suggesting she could put in more effort. She reacted extremely negatively, yelling and crying, and they haven't talked since. The author is confused and upset about her reaction and is seeking validation.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. The author's comment about other women might come off as dismissive. Even if he wasn't being angry, comparing her behavior to others could make her feel undervalued or criticized. Women's experiences with periods vary, and what's manageable for one might not be for another. By bringing up other women, he might have invalidated her feelings and experience, which can be a huge trigger for women who already feel dismissed about their pain.\n\nThe author might think he's being reasonable, but the way he expressed his frustration could have been hurtful. Expecting someone to push through physical discomfort, especially when it's as regular as a period, isn't always fair. Plus, the fact that her period timing was unpredictable adds to the difficulty. The author planned something weeks in advance, but life is unpredictable, and expecting her to always adapt might be unrealistic. \n\nAlso, his girlfriend's reaction suggests that this issue is a significant emotional trigger for her. The passive-aggressive comment about other women might have made her feel like her needs or pain aren't being respected. Even if he was trying to be gentle, the message could have been perceived as criticism. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should consider whether his approach was constructive. Instead of comparing her to others, maybe discussing how to find a compromise next time would be better. For example, planning activities that are less physically demanding or more flexible during her period. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's comment was probably hurtful and dismissive, even if his intention wasn't to be cruel. Comparing her to other women and suggesting she should put in more effort might not account for her specific experience and needs. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong, so option A.\n"
