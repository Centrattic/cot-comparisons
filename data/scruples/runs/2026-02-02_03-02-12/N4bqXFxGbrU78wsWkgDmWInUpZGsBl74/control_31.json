We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend is described as great, and they've been living together for three months. The main issue is her period. For the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything, cancels plans, and it's random when it comes. The author usually puts up with it, but this time he had a special date night planned weeks in advance. When she started her period on that day and canceled, he mentioned that other women don't act this way, implying she could make more effort. She got extremely angry, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. The author is upset and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reaction and communication. He says he wasn't angry but maybe passive-aggressive. He compared his current girlfriend to others, which can be a sensitive point. Comparisons like that often hurt, especially in relationships. It's important to consider that period cramps can be severe for some people, and it's a valid reason to cancel plans. The author had planned the date night weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. However, her period came at a random time, which she can't control. \n\nThe author's comment about other women not acting this way suggests he's holding her to a standard he's observed elsewhere. This might not be fair because every person's experience with menstruation is different. Some women can function normally, others can't. The girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but perhaps the author's words triggered her because he implied her behavior was unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of making a passive-aggressive comment, maybe he should have expressed his feelings without comparing her to others. His plan was thoughtful, but he might not have considered her pain and the unpredictability of her cycle. Even if he's trying to support her, the way he communicated his frustration might have been hurtful. \n\nSo, the answer likely is that the author is in the wrong (A) because his comment was dismissive of her needs and used comparisons that could be damaging. It's important to validate her experience rather than suggesting she should be different.\n"
