We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned a special date night, which he had arranged in advance. He mentions that this isn't the first time his girlfriend cancels plans during her period, and he's usually understanding. But this time, he felt a bit frustrated and made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, suggesting she could put in more effort. His girlfriend had a strong negative reaction, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she's on her period, which is a time when many women experience cramps, fatigue, and discomfort. The author notes that her period comes at a semi-random time each month, making it hard for him to plan around. However, the girlfriend might feel that her needs and health are being dismissed by his comment. Even if he's not being aggressive, bringing up other women could make her feel compared unfavorably, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. Comparing a partner to others, even if it's meant to highlight a difference in behavior, can be perceived as criticism. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve, possibly because she felt judged or that her valid health issues were being minimized.\n\nThe author claims he wasn't angry but passive-aggressive. Passive-aggressive communication can be damaging because it's indirect and often conveys criticism without clear expression. It's possible that the girlfriend felt criticized in a way she didn't expect, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nAdditionally, the author's frustration might stem from unmet expectations. He wanted a special night, which is understandable, but expecting someone to go out despite being in pain might be unrealistic. It's important for partners to have discussions about expectations and boundaries, especially when health issues are involved. The fact that they haven't talked about this openly might have contributed to the misunderstanding.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have roles here. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy and discussed how to handle such instances in the future rather than making a comparative remark. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have communicated her needs more clearly beforehand, especially if the date was known weeks in advance.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's comment, while not necessarily malicious, crossed a line by implying that his girlfriend's behavior was abnormal or lacking effort. This could have made her feel disrespected, leading to her strong reaction. The key issue is the manner in which he expressed his frustration, using a comparison that likely hurt her feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling his frustration constructively and respecting her health concerns.\n\nBut wait, the user initially thought the author is not in the wrong. Maybe there's another angle. The author's intention was to express frustration but not to criticize. However, the impact of his words matters more. Even if his intention was to find a solution, the method of bringing up other women might not be helpful. It's possible he didn't realize how his words could be taken. In relationships, it's crucial to consider how one's words affect the partner emotionally. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because his approach was hurtful despite his intentions.\n"
