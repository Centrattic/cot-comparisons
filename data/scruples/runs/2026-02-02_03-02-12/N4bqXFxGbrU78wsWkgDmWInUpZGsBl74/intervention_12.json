We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. From the description, the guy planned a special date night but his girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He expressed that he thought other women he's known don't act this way and that she could make more effort. The girlfriend had a huge emotional reaction, leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is on her period and experiences cramps. It's common for some women to feel unwell during those days. The guy says he usually puts up with it, but this time he got upset. The key issue here is his comment comparing his current girlfriend to others he's had, suggesting she's less capable of effort. \n\nComparing partners is generally a no-go. Even if he's not being confrontational, saying that other women don't act this way can come off as dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling invalidated. Her period is a personal and sometimes painful experience, and his comment could have hurt her, making her feel like her needs aren't respected.\n\nThe user says they're not sure if the author is wrong. The author's actions\u2014planning a special night and then getting upset when she couldn't go\u2014is understandable, but the way he communicated his frustration is problematic. Instead of acknowledging her pain, he brought up past experiences with others, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend's emotional response is a sign that she felt attacked or disrespected.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have approached the situation with empathy, understanding her condition, and perhaps adjusting plans without making comparisons. His comment was passive-aggressive, which can escalate conflicts. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. \n\nSo, while the author might have felt frustrated, his approach was flawed. The focus should be on supporting her rather than judging her behavior against others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his response was dismissive and hurtful, leading to a significant argument.\n"
