We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset because she canceled their planned date night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the girlfriend is great otherwise, but her period causes her to cancel plans. He had planned a special date and she canceled because her period started. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act like this, which made her really angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are about empathy and communication. The author is expressing frustration because his plans were canceled, but he might not be considering how his words could come off as dismissive of her pain. Saying that other women don't act this way could imply that her reaction is excessive, which is hurtful. \n\nPeriod symptoms can be severe for some people, including cramps, fatigue, and mood changes. Even if the author knows about periods, comparing her to other women might invalidate her experience. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or not understood. \n\nThe author's comment about others not acting the same way might have made her feel like her needs are less valid. It's important in relationships to support each other's needs, especially during times of discomfort. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words.\n\nAlso, the author planned the date knowing about her period's unpredictability but still expected her to go. Maybe he should have considered her possible need to rest beforehand. His frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was probably hurtful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment was passive-aggressive and compared her to others, which isn't helpful. He should have approached the situation with more empathy, maybe by asking how she was feeling instead of making a comparative statement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely did something wrong by not validating her feelings and instead making her feel like her pain isn't normal. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
