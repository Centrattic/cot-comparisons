We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The key points here are about communication, expectations in a relationship, and understanding each other's needs.\n\nFirst, the author plans a special date night, knowing her period is coming. The girlfriend cancels last minute, and the author expresses frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with. The girlfriend reacts strongly, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he feels his plans were disregarded, especially since he had scheduled it in advance. However, the girlfriend is dealing with period cramps, which can be debilitating for some people. The author's comment about other women not acting this way during their periods is problematic. It implies a judgment that her reaction is excessive, which could be seen as invalidating her feelings and physical state.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. The author might not have intended to be harsh, but bringing up past experiences with other women could make the girlfriend feel compared unfavorably. Even if the author wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment could have come across as dismissive of her pain. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that she felt her needs and the severity of her period were not respected.\n\nThe author should have considered a more empathetic approach. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed alternatives for the date night that accommodate her condition. The fact that he planned the night without considering her possible limitations might also be a factor. While it's reasonable to have expectations, the way he addressed the issue likely hurt her feelings and made her feel unappreciated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's approach was flawed. He should have communicated more supportively and considered her health and comfort. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
