We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who got upset because his girlfriend canceled their plans when she was on her period. He mentioned that he's been living with her and knows she's usually laid back, but her period makes her cancel everything for a couple of days. This time, he had a special date planned, and she canceled again. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she could make more effort, and she had a huge meltdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy planned something special and was probably looking forward to it. He might feel his efforts were disregarded. However, the girlfriend is dealing with period pain, which can be really severe for some people. Her reaction was extreme, but maybe she felt criticized or compared unfavorably to others.\n\nComparing her to other women he's lived with could be a big issue. Everyone's experience with period symptoms is different. What might be manageable for one person is unbearable for another. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel like her pain isn't valid or that she's being unreasonable. That could have triggered her anger and crying.\n\nEven if his tone wasn't angry, saying she could put in more effort might come across as dismissive. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests that his comment really hurt her. The key here is empathy. He might not realize how sensitive this topic is for her.\n\nSo, while he might have thought he was being reasonable, his words likely hurt her because they undermined her experience. Comparing her to others is a common mistake and can be very damaging. The author probably didn't intend to invalidate her pain, but that's how it came across. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because his comment was dismissive and hurtful, even if unintentionally.\n"
