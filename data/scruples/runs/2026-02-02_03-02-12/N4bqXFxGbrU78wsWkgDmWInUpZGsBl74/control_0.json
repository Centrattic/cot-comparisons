We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned a special date night, which his girlfriend knew about in advance. She ended up getting her period that day and canceled, leading to an argument. The author mentioned that he's had other women in his life who didn't act like this, implying that he expected more effort from his girlfriend. She reacted strongly, getting angry and crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author expected his girlfriend to make an effort despite her period, and he compared her to other women. The girlfriend felt disrespected or criticized, leading to a big argument. The user is asking if the author was wrong to get upset and make that comment.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication and empathy are key. The author's comment about other women not acting that way could come off as judgmental or dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings and physical discomfort. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have made her feel like her needs weren't respected. \n\nWomen's experiences with periods vary, and cramps can be severe enough to affect daily activities. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment hit a nerve, possibly making her feel invalidated or belittled. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to express his disappointment, but the method could be seen as insensitive. Even if his intention wasn't to be cruel, comparing his current partner to others is a common trigger for insecurity and can be hurtful. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because his response was not supportive and could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's situation. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others, perhaps finding a way to be understanding while also expressing his desire for the date night to happen. Maybe suggesting accommodations if possible, instead of implying she should push through without considering her comfort.\n"
