We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend regarding her period and how it affects their plans. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend is generally great, but when she's on her period, she cancels all plans and wants to stay home. He's been patient so far, understanding that women get cramps and such. However, one time he planned a special date night in advance, and she bailed on him because her period started that day. He told her, in a not too angry but maybe passive-aggressive way, that other women he's known don't act this way during their periods. That triggered a huge reaction from her, with her yelling and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA). The user thinks he's not, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are: \n\n1. The author planned a date knowing her period was coming. Wait, does he know when her period is? He says she can't schedule because it's semi-random. So maybe he didn't know it was starting that day. But he had planned weeks in advance. Did he know when her period would be when he planned the date? If he didn't, then maybe he didn't account for it. But if he did, and still went ahead, that might be different.\n\n2. The author's comment about other women he's known. Comparing his girlfriend to others is probably not helpful. Even if others have different experiences, it's not fair to compare. Each person's experience with their period can vary. Saying that other women don't act this way could come off as dismissive of her pain. Even if said calmly, it might invalidate her feelings.\n\n3. The girlfriend's reaction was intense. She was upset, which suggests that the comment hit a nerve. Maybe she feels he's not supportive, or that he's minimizing her discomfort. The author might have crossed a line by bringing up comparisons, which can be hurtful.\n\n4. The author's intention was to express frustration, but the method was flawed. He might have thought he was being reasonable, but the way he communicated it was hurtful. Even passive-aggressive comments can be damaging in relationships.\n\n5. The bigger issue is about communication. The author could have approached the situation differently instead of comparing her to others. Maybe discussing how to handle future period days, rather than making a judgment.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author felt justified, his comment was likely hurtful and dismissive of her feelings. Comparing her to others is a common mistake that can make someone feel criticized. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment was a significant trigger for her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his communication was inappropriate, even if his intention was to express frustration about the canceled plans.\n"
