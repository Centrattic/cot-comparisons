We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend are in a relationship, living together. The main issue is that when she's on her period, especially the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything and cancels plans. The author usually accepts this, but there was one instance where he had a planned date night, which she canceled because she got her period that day. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that he knows other women who don't act like that even during their periods, implying she could have made more effort. She reacted very strongly, got upset, and they haven't talked since. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he made an effort to plan a special date, which he had scheduled in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. He feels frustrated that she canceled at the last minute, even though he usually puts up with her period-related cancellations. He's made a comment about other women not acting this way, which led to a big conflict.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's dealing with her period, which is physically uncomfortable (cramps, etc.), and she needs to rest. She might feel that her needs aren't being respected, especially since the author is bringing up other women's behavior as a comparison. The fact that she locked herself in her room and cried shows she was deeply hurt by his comment. \n\nNow, considering the question of right or wrong. The author's comment about other women could be seen as invalidating her feelings. Even if he didn't mean to be aggressive, comparing her to other women implies that her reaction is excessive. This can come off as dismissive of her legitimate physical discomfort. The key here is communication. The author might have felt let down by the canceled plans, but instead of expressing his disappointment respectfully, he made a comparative statement that likely made her feel criticized. \n\nThe girlfriend might have felt that her needs for rest and comfort during her period are being ignored, especially when the author has plans. The problem is that the author's approach didn't take into account her specific situation but instead used a generalization. Even if his intention was to suggest she could make more effort, the way he phrased it was hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is that the author had the date planned, but the girlfriend's period was unpredictable. However, he had prior knowledge of her period patterns and could have considered that when planning. Maybe he should have discussed alternatives or been more flexible. But he did mention that he usually puts up with it, so this was a specific incident where he got frustrated.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's communication. Comparing her to other women, even passively, can be seen as disrespectful and unempathetic. It's important in relationships to validate each other's feelings. If the author wanted to express his disappointment, he should have done so without belittling her experience. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not in being upset about the canceled plans but in how he expressed his feelings. By bringing up other women, he undermined her situation, leading to a major conflict. Therefore, he is in the wrong because his communication was invalidating and hurtful.\n"
