We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled it because of her period. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act that way, which upset her a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's girlfriend has health issues that affect her willingness to go out. She's been consistent about this before, and he mentions he's usually okay with it. But this one time, he got frustrated and made a comment about other women being more effort. That's when she reacted strongly.\n\nThe key points here are communication and understanding. The author planned something special, which is understandable. However, he made a comparison to other women, which might have invalidated her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, bringing up past experiences with other women could come off as dismissive of her current situation. It's important to acknowledge her pain without comparing to others. Comparing can make someone feel unappreciated or misunderstood.\n\nAlso, his girlfriend reacted intensely, which suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might feel that he's not respecting her needs, especially since she's already mentioned her period as a time when she's unwell. The author might have thought he was being reasonable, but the way he communicated his frustration led to a bigger conflict. So, the issue here is about empathy and how to address differing expectations in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's feelings. Even if someone else might handle a situation differently, it's about what works for the couple. The author could have expressed his disappointment without belittling her experience. Therefore, the author's approach was flawed, making him at least partially responsible for the conflict. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
