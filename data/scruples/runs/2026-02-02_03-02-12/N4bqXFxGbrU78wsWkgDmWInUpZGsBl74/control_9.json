We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she called it off because she was on her period. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act like that, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has been going through this issue every month, and the author is now frustrated. But he acknowledges that periods can be painful. However, he still had expectations for her to go along with the plans despite her discomfort. The key point is that the author made a comparison to other women, implying that his girlfriend isn't making enough effort. That's probably where the problem lies. Comparing her to others can feel dismissive of her experience and invalidate her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, being passive-aggressive and bringing up past relationships might make her feel judged. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment hurt her deeply. The author should have considered her needs and maybe found a compromise instead of expressing frustration in a way that made her feel unappreciated. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. He should have communicated more empathetically and not compared his partner to others.\n"
