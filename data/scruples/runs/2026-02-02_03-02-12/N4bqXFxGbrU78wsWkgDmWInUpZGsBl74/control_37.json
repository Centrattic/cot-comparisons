We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months. She doesn't want to do anything during her period's first two days, which he finds frustrating. He mentions that she cancels plans even if they're set in advance, and her period timing is irregular. He usually puts up with it, but this particular time, they had a special date night planned weeks in advance. She started her period that day and canceled, leading to an argument where he compared her to other women he's known. She got extremely upset, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a comparison to other women (he's lived with others before), implying she's not handling her period as well. That's what set her off. The question is whether he was wrong for that.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, comparing a partner to others is often seen as a no-no. It can come off as disrespectful and invalidates their feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment still brings up past experiences in a way that might make her feel inadequate. He's suggesting she could put in more effort, which might dismiss her physical discomfort. Periods can be really painful for some people, and expecting them to go out despite that might be unreasonable. \n\nHer reaction was intense, which could indicate that his comment hit a nerve. Maybe she felt judged or that her needs weren't respected. Communication is key in relationships, and instead of comparing her to others, he might have expressed his feelings without judgment. He could have discussed his feelings about the canceled plans more constructively, perhaps finding a middle ground for future situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated because he had made plans in advance and she canceled. But he's aware of her periods beforehand, so maybe he should have considered that when scheduling. However, it's also about mutual respect. If she's in pain, he should prioritize her comfort, but he might feel his efforts are unappreciated.\n\nThe main issue here is the comparison to other women. That's likely where he went wrong. It's a common mistake in relationships where someone tries to justify their feelings by referencing others, which can be hurtful. Even if his intention was to express frustration, the method was flawed. He should have approached it without belittling her experience, instead focusing on how the cancellations affect him and seeking a solution together.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he made a comparison that invalidated his girlfriend's feelings and needs. The answer is A.\n"
