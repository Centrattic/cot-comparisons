We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which happens at irregular times. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled it. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, implying she's not making enough effort. She got extremely upset, called him names, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to express his frustration. Let's break it down. The girlfriend has a medical condition (period pain) that affects her ability to engage in social activities. The author planned something important, but she couldn't make it. Instead of trying to find a compromise or understanding her situation, he compared her to other women, suggesting she should push through. That could be seen as dismissive of her health and feelings.\n\nEven if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment about other women might have invalidated her experience. It's important to acknowledge that period pain can be severe and vary for each individual. The author's expectation that she should act like others might not be realistic. Also, his frustration led to a significant argument, which hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, he had planned something special, so his disappointment is understandable. However, the way he communicated his feelings was hurtful. Instead of expressing his disappointment, he criticized her, which escalated the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his feelings without invalidating her experience. He might need to apologize and work on understanding her needs better. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, but her pain and frustration are valid too. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did make a mistake by comparing her to others and not being supportive. He should have found a kinder way to express his feelings. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
