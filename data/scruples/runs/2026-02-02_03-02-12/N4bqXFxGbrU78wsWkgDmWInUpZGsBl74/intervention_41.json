We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night but she couldn't go because her period started. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act this way, which made her really upset.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective: he had put effort into planning, knew about her period, but still wanted her to make an effort. He wasn't angry but passive-aggressive. The girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's side. Menstrual cramps can be really painful for some people. It's possible she was in a lot of pain and couldn't handle going out. Comparing her to other women might have made her feel judged or not understood. Even if it's not intentional, bringing up other women in a comparison can be hurtful. \n\nThe author's comment about other women might have come off as dismissive of her feelings. He knows she's usually laid back, but maybe he didn't consider how sensitive she is about this issue. Even though he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive tone could have triggered her. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author planned ahead, so he knew about the period, yet still expected her to go through with the plans. Maybe he didn't fully grasp how much pain she was in. His comment about other women could have invalidated her experience. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other through different health issues. Even if her reaction was extreme, the author's approach might have been a catalyst. Instead of comparing, he could have asked how she was feeling or offered alternative plans. \n\nSo, was he in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. He had valid feelings about the effort he put in, but his delivery and the comparison were probably hurtful. He should have communicated more empathetically. So I think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his words and approach were dismissive and hurtful, even if his intentions were to encourage effort.\n"
