We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she ended up staying home. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could make more effort, which led to her having a strong negative reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend is experiencing cramps during her period and cancels plans. The author had planned this date in advance, but she knew about it. He mentions that other women he's known don't act this way. The girlfriend then reacts angrily and emotionally.\n\nSo, from a general perspective, it's important to recognize that period cramps can be debilitating for some people. The fact that she cancels plans because she's in pain is a valid reason. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014he invested time and effort into planning, and it's disappointing when plans get canceled. However, his response was to compare her to other women, which could come off as dismissive of her feelings and pain. Comparing her to others might make her feel like her experience isn't valid, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt disrespected or invalidated. The author's comment about other women not acting this way might have triggered her because it's a sensitive topic. It's also worth noting that everyone's experience with menstruation is different. What might be manageable for one person could be extremely painful for another. The author might not realize that his expectations are based on his own experiences or others', which isn't fair to impose on his girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did say he wasn't angry, just a bit passive-aggressive. But even passive-aggressive comments can be damaging, especially when they involve comparisons that imply judgment. The key here is empathy. The author could have expressed his disappointment in a way that acknowledges her pain while also sharing his feelings about the canceled plans. Instead, he undermined her experience by referencing other women, which could make her feel like her needs aren't being respected.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have discussed his feelings about the cancellations before the date night. He might have assumed she understood his perspective, but he didn't address it in a constructive way. The girlfriend's emotional response suggests that the comment really hurt her, which indicates that the author's approach was inappropriate, even if his intentions were to encourage effort.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance understanding each other's needs. The author's frustration is valid, but his method of addressing it was flawed. He should have found a way to communicate his feelings without invalidating her. The girlfriend's strong reaction points to the hurt caused by his words. Therefore, the author's comment was inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because his comment was dismissive of his girlfriend's pain and made her feel compared unfavorably to others. Even if he was trying to express his feelings about the canceled plans, the way he communicated it was harmful. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
