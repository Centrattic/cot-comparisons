We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset and made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author finds frustrating because he had planned a special date. He mentioned that he knew about her period in advance but still made plans. The key point here is that he went ahead with the plans despite knowing her cycle, which might be part of the issue. \n\nThen, during the date, when she cancels, he tells her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she could put in more effort. This comment led to a huge argument. The girlfriend was upset and felt criticized. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might feel his needs aren't being met, but how he expressed that was probably hurtful. Comparing her to other women is a classic no-no because it can make someone feel judged or inadequate. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment likely invalidated her feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but her pain and discomfort during her period are real. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy. Instead of criticizing her, maybe discussing how they can handle future situations better would be more constructive. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not considering her feelings and using a comparison that made her feel attacked. He should have addressed his feelings without dismissing hers. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
