We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out during her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has been living with period-related issues where she's unwell for the first two days. The author usually puts up with it, but this one time, he planned a special date night that got canceled. He made a comment comparing her behavior to other women he's lived with, implying she could do better. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling him names and crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's comment about other women, the comparison, and the context of the girlfriend's health. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment hurt her feelings, possibly making her feel criticized or not supported. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might think he's being reasonable, but bringing up other women's experiences can be perceived as a criticism, especially in a sensitive situation. It's important to validate the partner's feelings rather than minimizing them by comparing to others. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's pain during her period is a physical and emotional challenge. The author's frustration is understandable, but expressing it in a way that feels dismissive of her condition could be the issue. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, the comment came off as judgmental. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered how his words might affect her. Instead of making a passive-aggressive remark, he could have expressed his feelings in a more supportive way, perhaps discussing how to handle future plans together. \n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that the author's words were hurtful. Therefore, it's likely that he is in the wrong here for not being understanding and for making a comparison that invalidated her experience.\n"
