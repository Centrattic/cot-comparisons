We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with a girlfriend they've been living with for three months. The main issue is that when she's on her period, especially the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything. She cancels plans and just stays home. The author usually accepts this, but one time they had a special date night planned\u2014dinner and a movie\u2014that they'd set up weeks in advance. The girlfriend ended up getting her period that day and canceled, which made the author a bit passive-aggressive, comparing her to other women they've lived with who don't act like that even when on their period. The girlfriend then had a huge meltdown, calling the author names, crying, and they haven't talked since. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author planned something special and got upset when the girlfriend canceled because of her period. They made a comment implying that other women don't act this way, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions that the girlfriend is usually sweet and kind, and this is the main issue. The author is trying to put up with her period cramps but is getting frustrated because the plans are being canceled repeatedly. However, in this specific instance, there was a pre-planned date night that the author had worked hard on. The girlfriend knew about it weeks in advance but still canceled last minute when her period started.\n\nBut the author's comment about other women is problematic. Comparing one's partner to others, even if done passively, can be a big trigger. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that this comment hit a nerve. Maybe she felt criticized or like her pain wasn't being validated. Even if the author wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark could still be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel that her needs and pain aren't being respected, especially when she's already in a vulnerable state due to her period.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author might not have expressed their feelings in a constructive way. Instead of pointing out other women, maybe they could have expressed their own feelings about the canceled plans and asked for a compromise. For example, \"I feel disappointed when we have to cancel, but I understand you're not feeling well. Maybe we could find something we can do together that's less strenuous?\" That way, the focus is on their own feelings rather than comparing the girlfriend to others.\n\nAlso, the author's initial willingness to put up with the cancellations is a good sign, but in this case, they might have felt that the effort was more justified because it was a special occasion. However, the way they addressed the issue was not effective. The girlfriend's response indicates that the comment about other women was a major issue for her, possibly making her feel inadequate or invalidated in her experience.\n\nAnother angle is understanding that menstrual discomfort varies from person to person. What might be manageable for one person could be debilitating for another. The author might not realize the severity of their partner's symptoms. Assuming that other women don't act this way could be minimizing her experience. It's possible that the girlfriend's reaction was not just to the comment but also to the underlying message that her pain isn't as bad as others'.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely the catalyst for the argument. Even if the intention was to express frustration about the canceled plans, the method of bringing up other women as a benchmark was a poor choice. The girlfriend's intense reaction suggests that the comment was perceived as invalidating her experience and possibly a criticism of her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they communicated their feelings instead of addressing the issue directly and empathetically.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have chosen a different approach to express their disappointment without comparing the girlfriend to others. The girlfriend's right to cancel plans when she's unwell is valid, but the way the author handled the situation could have been more compassionate. The key takeaway is that the method of communication was inappropriate, which led to the conflict.\n"
