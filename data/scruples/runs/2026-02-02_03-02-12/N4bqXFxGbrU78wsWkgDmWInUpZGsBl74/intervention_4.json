We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation involves a planned date night that was canceled because the girlfriend was on her period. The author had planned it weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should put in more effort. The girlfriend then got extremely upset, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's complaint is about the girlfriend canceling plans during her period. He mentions that he's been patient up to this point, but this time he got impatient and made a passive-aggressive comment. He's now questioning if he was wrong to do so.\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, communication is crucial. Comparing one's partner to others is often a big no-no. Even if the author is frustrated, bringing up past experiences with other women can come off as dismissive or invalidating. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment hurt her deeply, leading to an emotional outburst. \n\nMenstrual cramps can be debilitating for some women, and while others might manage to go out despite the pain, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. The author's comment implies that his girlfriend's reaction is excessive compared to others, which might make her feel unsupported or criticized. \n\nThe girlfriend locking herself in her room and the couple not talking since indicates that the situation is serious. The author's approach might not have been empathetic enough. Instead of expressing his disappointment constructively, he made a passive-aggressive remark, which likely escalated the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014making a comparison and expressing frustration in a passive-aggressive manner\u2014were likely hurtful and contributed to the conflict. Even if he felt justified, the way he communicated his feelings was not healthy. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
