We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their plans when she was on her period. He had planned a special date night, but she didn't feel like going out. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act that way, and she had a strong negative reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that he had put a lot of effort into planning, and he feels his girlfriend isn't trying hard enough. He's frustrated because her periods are irregular and he can't plan around them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is in pain during her period and cancels plans. The author's comment about other women and implying she should put in more effort led to her emotional outburst.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships. Periods are a natural part of life and can cause physical and emotional discomfort. It's common for women to feel more tired or in pain during this time. The author's frustration might be understandable, but the way he expressed it could be problematic. Comparing his girlfriend to other women in a critical way, even passively, could be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling criticized and not being supported during a time when she needs understanding.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author's approach was passive-aggressive, which can be more damaging. Instead of expressing his feelings about the situation, he made a comparison that might make her feel inadequate. He should have discussed his feelings without belittling her experience. His actions might have dismissed her legitimate needs and pain, leading to her emotional response.\n\nFrom a relationship advice standpoint, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author's statement about other women could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive comment can still be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction shows she felt attacked, which makes sense given the context.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author initiated the conflict by making a critical comment. While his frustration is understandable, the way he handled it was unkind. The girlfriend's response, though intense, is a reaction to feeling criticized. So, the author's actions were the catalyst for the argument. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and communication, rather than making a comparison that could be seen as dismissive.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because his comment, though not shouted in anger, was hurtful and invalidated his girlfriend's experience. He should have addressed his feelings without comparing her to others and sought a mutual understanding instead.\n"
