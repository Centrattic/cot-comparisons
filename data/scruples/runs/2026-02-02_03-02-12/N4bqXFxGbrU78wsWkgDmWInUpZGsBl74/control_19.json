We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. So the situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author gets upset because he planned a special date. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should put in more effort. She reacted very angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as usually great and laid-back, but during her period, she's unresponsive and cancels plans. The author plans something months in advance, but she cancels last minute. He mentions that she knew about the plans weeks ahead, but her period started on that day. \n\nThe key point here is the author's comment about other women. Even if it's not said angrily, comparing his girlfriend to others could be hurtful. Periods can be physically and emotionally challenging, and expecting someone to push through it for a date might not be reasonable. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach was probably dismissive of her needs. \n\nHe says he's not angry but passive-aggressive. Passive-aggressive behavior is generally not constructive. Also, by bringing up other women, he might have invalidated her feelings. She might feel like her pain isn't acknowledged. The fact that she reacted so strongly with anger and crying suggests that his comment was deeply hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of making comparisons, the author could have expressed his disappointment and asked how they could find a solution together. His response was more about his expectations than her well-being. So, from a relationship advice perspective, his approach was flawed. He's in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective and made a hurtful comparison. The answer is A.\n"
