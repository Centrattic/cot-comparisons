We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she backed out, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has been on her period, which can cause cramps and discomfort. The author acknowledges that women get cramps, but he's frustrated because she cancels plans even when she knew about the date in advance. The key point is his comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not making enough effort. \n\nFrom a general perspective, it's important to recognize that PMS or menstrual cramps can vary in severity. Some women might handle it differently. The girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014shouting, crying, locking herself in. That suggests the comment hit a nerve. \n\nThe author's approach was passive-aggressive. Even if he wasn't angry, framing it as \"I know other women who don't act like this\" is dismissive of her feelings and implies she's exaggerating. This could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy, maybe asking how she's feeling instead of making a comparison. The fact that they haven't talked since indicates a breakdown in communication. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior\u2014canceling plans on her period\u2014might be her way of managing discomfort, but the author's reaction was to question her effort rather than offer support. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not considering her feelings and using a comparison that's hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction shows how deeply that comment affected her. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not showing empathy and for making a passive-aggressive remark.\n"
