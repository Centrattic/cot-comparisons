We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is described as great, funny, laid-back, and they've been living together for three months. The main issue is her period. She cancels plans for the first two days when she's on her period, staying home and being in pain. The author usually puts up with it, but one time he planned a special date night, which she had known about weeks in advance. When she got her period that day, she canceled, and he expressed frustration, comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act like that. This led to a big argument.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side, he planned a special evening weeks in advance. He made reservations, bought tickets, dressed up. He had every reason to believe she would come through. But she canceled at the last minute, which must have been frustrating. He's not angry, just a bit passive-aggressive. He mentions that other women he's known don't act this way, implying he feels she's overreacting or not making an effort.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she's dealing with period cramps, which can be debilitating. She's in physical pain, so staying home is a way to manage it. The author is asking her to go out despite her pain, which might not be realistic. Also, comparing her to other women is dismissive of her experience and could make her feel judged.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author might not have considered how his comment about other women hurt her feelings. Even if it's not meant to be harsh, pointing out that others don't react the same way can invalidate her experience. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014losing her cool, crying, and locking herself in\u2014suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might feel that her pain isn't being respected, and the author's comparison undermines her feelings.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially with the effort he put into the plans. However, the way he expressed his frustration might have been insensitive. Even if he's not wrong about the situation (some people might handle periods differently), the approach matters. It's important to acknowledge her pain and maybe find a compromise rather than comparing her to others.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was probably inconsiderate. He should have expressed his disappointment in a more supportive way, perhaps asking how he can help instead of making a comparison. Therefore, he's in the wrong for how he handled the situation, even if his intentions were to express frustration about the canceled plans.\n"
