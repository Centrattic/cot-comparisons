We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the guy gets upset because she cancels plans, even though he knew about her period in advance. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He's okay with it most of the time but got upset this time because he had a special date planned. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, implying she should try harder. She got really angry and started crying. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFrom what I know, period cramps can be really debilitating for some people. Even if someone knows when it's coming, the timing can be unpredictable. The author mentions her period comes \"semi-randomly,\" so maybe she can't always predict it accurately. But in this case, she did know about the plans in advance. However, even if you know, the symptoms might be severe enough that day, regardless of planning.\n\nThe author's main issue is comparing her to other women he's lived with, suggesting she's not putting in enough effort. That's probably not helpful. Everyone's experience with periods is different. What's normal for one person might not be for another. By bringing up other women, he's invalidating her feelings and experience, which can be really hurtful. It's not about effort; it's about physical and emotional pain. She might not be faking it to avoid plans but genuinely struggling.\n\nHe also planned a special date, which is great, but expecting someone who's in pain to go out despite knowing how they feel might be unrealistic. Maybe he should have checked in with her that day to see how she was feeling instead of assuming she could go. But he did mention she canceled once she got home, so maybe she realized she couldn't make it. Still, comparing her to others is a big no-no in relationships. It can make people feel unappreciated or judged.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but it shows how hurt she felt by his comments. The author's passive-aggressive remark about other women might have crossed a line, even if he wasn't angry. He needs to understand that her experience is valid, regardless of others. It's about empathy and communication. He should apologize for invalidating her pain and maybe find a way to support her better next time without expecting her to push through discomfort if it's too much.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he dismissed her feelings and compared her to others, which is hurtful and not supportive. Even if he had plans, her health and well-being should take priority, and communication should be more about understanding than comparisons.\n"
