We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels their plans because she's on her period. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend doesn't go out at all when she has her period, especially the first two days. He's tried to be understanding, knowing that periods can be painful. But there was a specific instance where they had a planned date night, which he had arranged weeks in advance, and she canceled it because her period started that day. He then told her that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, implying she could try harder. This led to her having a huge emotional outburst.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's frustration might be understandable because he invested time and effort into planning a special night. However, the way he expressed his frustration was by comparing his current girlfriend to others, which can be hurtful. It's important to note that every woman's experience with periods is different. Just because other women didn't act the same way doesn't mean his girlfriend is wrong or that her needs are invalid. \n\nThe key point here is the communication. Instead of making a comparison that could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, he might have expressed his disappointment more empathetically. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel judged or like her pain wasn't valid, which could explain her strong reaction. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's feelings. Even if one partner is frustrated, how they communicate that matters. The author's comment about other women could be perceived as implying that his girlfriend isn't trying hard enough, which isn't fair. Everyone has different physical needs and pain tolerance levels. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely wrong in feeling let down, his approach to addressing the issue was flawed. He should have considered her feelings more and perhaps found a solution that works for both of them, like rescheduling or finding a more flexible activity. The fact that his girlfriend reacted so strongly indicates that his words hurt her, and that suggests he was in the wrong for how he expressed his feelings rather than the feelings themselves.\n"
