We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months. The main issue is that when she's on her period, especially the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything. She usually cancels plans and stays on the couch. The author usually puts up with this, but there was a specific instance where he had planned a special date night with dinner and a movie, which she canceled because her period started that day. He made a comment that other women he's known don't act this way during their periods, implying she should make more effort. She got extremely upset, yelled at him, cried, and they haven't talked since. The author is now confused and asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's grievance is about his girlfriend's behavior during her period, specifically the impact on their plans. He planned something special, which she canceled. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, which upset her. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author's comment about other women likely came across as dismissive of her feelings and physical state. Menstrual cramps and related discomfort can be severe for some women, and it's not a matter of effort but of health and well-being. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after planning something special, but his approach was confrontational and generalized. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she was in pain and chose to prioritize her health, which is reasonable. The author's comparison to other women might imply that her reaction is excessive, which can be hurtful. Women's experiences with periods vary, and it's not fair to judge another person's experience based on others.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's a sign that the author's comment struck a nerve. She might feel disrespected or misunderstood. The author's passive-aggressive comment may have invalidated her feelings, leading to her emotional outburst. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author didn't directly address his feelings in a constructive way. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed his feelings about the plans being canceled and how to handle such situations in the future. \n\nThe author's actions, while stemming from frustration, were not supportive of his girlfriend's health needs. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and physical limitations. The girlfriend's right to prioritize her well-being during her period should be acknowledged. The author's expectation that she should make an effort despite her discomfort might not be realistic or considerate.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because his comment was dismissive and lacked empathy. He should have approached the situation with understanding and sought a solution rather than making a comparison that invalidated her experience.\n"
