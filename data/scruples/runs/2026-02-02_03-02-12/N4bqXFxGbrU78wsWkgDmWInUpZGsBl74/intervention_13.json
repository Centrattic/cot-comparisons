We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author got upset and made a comment comparing her behavior to other women he's lived with. The girlfriend reacted strongly, leading to a major conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is that he planned a special date night in advance, and the girlfriend canceled last minute. He expressed frustration, mentioning that other women he's known don't act this way. The girlfriend felt criticized and hurt, leading to an emotional outburst.\n\nFrom a relationship advice standpoint, communication is key. The author might have thought he was being reasonable, pointing out that it's possible to manage period symptoms to some extent. However, comparing her to other women is a classic no-no. People can take that as a personal attack, implying she's not trying hard enough or that she's not as capable of managing her health. That could be the trigger for her strong reaction.\n\nThe author mentions that the period starts at random times, making it hard to plan. But he had weeks to prepare, and she knew about the plans. Still, periods can be unpredictable, and even if she knew the date, it's possible the cramps started that day. However, the author's comment about other women might have been the real issue here. Making such a comparison can come off as invalidating her experience and not respecting her needs.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author's frustration is valid because he put effort into planning. But his approach might have been dismissive of her physical discomfort. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have expressed his disappointment and talked about finding a solution, like maybe adjusting the plans together or showing support.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling criticized and not supported. When someone is in pain, they might need empathy rather than criticism, even if the criticism is meant to be helpful. The author's passive-aggressive comment could have made her feel unappreciated and attacked.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment about other women is likely the main issue here. Even if his intention was to express his feelings about the situation, the way he did it was hurtful and invalidating. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for the way he communicated his frustration, even if his frustration itself is understandable. The answer is probably A because the author's approach was inappropriate, even if the situation is complicated.\n"
