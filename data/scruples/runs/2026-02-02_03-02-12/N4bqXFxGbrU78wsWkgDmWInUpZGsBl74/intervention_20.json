We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which he's usually okay with. But this time, he planned a special date night, and she canceled again. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could do better. She got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nThe author feels he's not in the wrong because he's had other experiences where women managed to go out even on their periods. But the key here is communication. Even if his intention wasn't to be mean, bringing up other women in a passive-aggressive way is a common relationship no-no. Comparing partners to others is usually a bad move because it can come off as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nHe mentioned that she's been clear about her needs before, so he should have known she might cancel this time too. Planning weeks in advance but not considering her cycle's unpredictability might have been a mistake. Also, his comment about other women might not take into account her personal experience or that she might feel different from others. \n\nEven if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive remark could be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment really struck a nerve. She might feel invalidated or criticized for her pain and needs. The author might not realize how his words affected her, which could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nSo, while the author's frustration is understandable, the way he expressed it was likely disrespectful. He should have communicated his feelings without making comparisons. Therefore, he's in the wrong for the way he handled the situation, even if his intentions were to express his disappointment.\n"
