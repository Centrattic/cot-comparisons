We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend experiences severe symptoms during her period for the first two days, to the point where she cancels plans and stays home. The author has been generally understanding about this, but one time he had a special date night planned weeks in advance. She had known about it, but when her period started that day, she canceled. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, who don't act this way even when on their period. This led to a big argument where the girlfriend was extremely upset and now they haven't talked directly since.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is frustrated because his plans were canceled, but he expressed his frustration in a way that might not be supportive. He compared her to other women, implying she's not trying hard enough. The girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names and crying. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom what I know about period-related issues, menstrual cramps can be very debilitating. Some women experience severe pain that affects their daily activities. The author seems to acknowledge that she has cramps (\"cramps and shit during shark week\"), but he's upset that she doesn't put in any effort even on those days. However, his comment about other women he's known suggests he's not being empathetic. Comparing her to other women in such a context is likely to be hurtful, because it dismisses her experience and implies she's being overly sensitive or lazy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while extreme, might be a result of feeling criticized for her pain. When someone is in pain and feels their needs are being dismissed or compared to others, that can lead to significant emotional distress. The author's passive-aggressive comment could have crossed a line by not respecting her boundaries and her physical state.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the girlfriend locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. It's possible that the author didn't consider how his words would affect her emotionally. Even if he's frustrated, the way he expressed his feelings was disrespectful and not supportive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of making a passive-aggressive comment about other women, a more constructive approach would be to discuss how to handle future plans or find alternatives that accommodate her needs. However, the author's response was dismissive of her experience, which is a significant issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely hurtful and inconsiderate. Even if he had plans, respecting her health and well-being is more important. The way he handled the situation was not supportive and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
