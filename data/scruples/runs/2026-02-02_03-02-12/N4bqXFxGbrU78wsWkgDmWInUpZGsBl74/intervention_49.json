We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she didn't want to go out when she was on her period. They had a planned date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He expressed that he thought other women could manage to go out even when they had their period, which upset her a lot. She reacted very strongly, calling him names and crying, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend usually doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period. He usually puts up with it, but this time he got impatient. The key point here is his comment about other women not acting like that. He's comparing his current girlfriend to others he's lived with, implying she's making more of an issue than necessary.\n\nFrom a general perspective, periods can be physically uncomfortable, and some women might feel too unwell to go out. It's a common experience, but everyone's different. However, the author's main issue is not just that she canceled the plans, but that he thinks she's not putting in enough effort compared to other women. That comparison might be problematic because it's not fair to judge one person's experience by another's. Also, even if some women can manage to go out, it doesn't mean that those who can't are being lazy or inconsiderate.\n\nCommunication is another factor. The author says he wasn't angry, but passive-aggressive. Passive-aggressive communication can be hurtful even if not shouted. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that his comment hit a sensitive spot. She might feel criticized for her natural response to her body's condition. Using past experiences with other women to make a point might come off as dismissive of her specific situation.\n\nThe author planned the date weeks in advance, which shows he wanted to make an effort. But he should also consider her well-being. If she's genuinely unwell, forcing her to go out might not be the best approach. However, the way he expressed his frustration was comparative and dismissive, which could be seen as invalidating her feelings and experiences.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of empathy. It's important to acknowledge that pain and discomfort can affect someone's ability to engage in activities. By suggesting others don't act this way, the author might be implying that her reaction is excessive, which could be hurtful. Even if his intention wasn't to be cruel, the message could be received as such.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but reactions can vary based on how the comment is perceived. If she felt criticized or judged, her emotional response is understandable. The author's comparison might have made her feel like her health issues aren't being respected.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment, while not necessarily malicious, was insensitive. It's possible he didn't consider how his words would affect her. The fact that they haven't talked since indicates that the communication breakdown is significant. He needs to take responsibility for his part in the argument by using a passive-aggressive approach and making a comparative statement that could be seen as belittling her experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's intention might have been to express frustration, the way he did it was inconsiderate. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding instead of comparing his girlfriend to others. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for his part in the conflict.\n"
