We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, especially for the first two days. He mentions she just stays home, watches TV, and that her period comes at random times. He usually puts up with it, but one time he planned a special date night weeks in advance, and she canceled because her period started that day. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she could put more effort in. She got really upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The girlfriend is clearly experiencing period-related discomfort, which is a real thing. The author planned something special, which is understandable. But when he compared her to other women and suggested she should put in more effort, that might have been a misstep. Comparing her to others can come off as dismissive of her feelings and physical state. Even if he wasn't angry, saying it passively-aggressively could still be hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but maybe it's because she felt criticized or judged. Menstrual pain is real and varies from person to person. What one woman can handle, another might not. By bringing up other women, the author might have invalidated her experience. It's possible she felt he didn't understand or respect her needs. The author's frustration is valid to some extent, but his approach might have been the problem. Instead of implying she should act differently, maybe he could have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. Like, \"I was really looking forward to our date, but I understand if you're not feeling well. Is there something else we can do together?\" That might have been more constructive.\n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, his words were hurtful and potentially disrespectful. The girlfriend's reaction, while extreme, might stem from feeling criticized about her body and how she manages her period. The author's comment about other women could imply that her response is excessive, which is not helpful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings in the way he communicated his disappointment.\n"
