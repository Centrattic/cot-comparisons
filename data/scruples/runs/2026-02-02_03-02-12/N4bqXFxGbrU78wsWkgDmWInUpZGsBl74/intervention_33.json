We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough. She had a big reaction to that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are communication, empathy, and expectations. The author planned something special weeks in advance, which is understandable. But his girlfriend has a known issue with her period causing her to cancel plans. The author's comment about other women not acting that way is problematic. Comparing your partner to others is usually a bad move in relationships. It can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have been the last straw for her, especially if she's already dealing with physical discomfort and the stress of her period. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she was already frustrated with the recurring issue. The author might not realize how his comment invalidated her situation. Period cramps can be really painful, and expecting someone to push through that might be unreasonable. His comment could have made her feel unappreciated or as if her needs aren't valid. \n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions with planning the date and trying to understand her cramps, his approach was flawed. The comparison to other women and implying she should try harder might have been the trigger. In relationships, communication is key, and it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author could have handled it better by expressing his disappointment without criticizing her. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his comment was hurtful and dismissive, even if unintentionally, and contributed to the conflict.\n"
