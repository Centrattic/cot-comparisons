We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author expressing frustration about it, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He mentions that he's usually okay with it, but this one time, he planned a special date that she canceled because of her period. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way and that she could try harder for him. That's when she got extremely upset.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel invalidated. Menstrual cramps can be really painful and debilitating for some people. The author's comment about other women could imply that her reaction is excessive or that she's not handling it the \"right\" way. That can be really hurtful because it's like saying her pain isn't valid compared to others. \n\nThe author's statement about knowing other women who don't act this way might come off as dismissive. Everyone's body is different. What's manageable for one person might be impossible for another. By bringing up past experiences with other women, he's not addressing her specific situation but rather comparing her to others, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and was very upset shows that his words really hurt her. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment still crossed a line. The key here is empathy. Instead of focusing on how other women handle it, he should have validated her feelings and maybe found another way to support her during that time without expecting her to meet his expectations.\n\nThe author might not have intended to be hurtful, but his approach wasn't considerate. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her, and bringing up comparisons to other women likely made her feel disrespected. So, even if the author's intention was to express his frustration, the way he communicated it was problematic. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong here.\n"
