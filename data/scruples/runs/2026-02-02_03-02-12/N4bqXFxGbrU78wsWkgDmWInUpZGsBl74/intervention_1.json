We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset because she canceled their planned date. He mentioned that he's been with other women who didn't act this way, so he thought she could put in a little more effort. Then she got really angry and cried, and they haven't talked directly since.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the context. First, the girlfriend's behavior is understandable. Periods can be really uncomfortable, and cramps can make people not feel up to social activities or physical exertion. The author acknowledges that generally, she's great and laid back, so maybe he's not entirely dismissive of her needs. However, the key issue is how he approached it. He told her that other women he's known didn't act this way and implied she should make more effort. Comparing her to other women can come off as dismissive of her experience, even if he didn't mean it to be harsh. \n\nBy saying \"I know other women\" and suggesting she should put in more effort, he might have invalidated her feelings. People in pain or discomfort, especially related to health, can be sensitive. Even if he said it passively, the comparison could be seen as critical. Her reaction was intense, which might indicate that she felt her needs weren't respected. The author could have handled it better by showing more empathy and understanding, maybe offering to adjust the plans or support her in a different way. \n\nSo, even if he had a valid point about her canceling plans, the way he communicated it was probably not the best approach. The question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the main problem here is the comparison to other women, which can be a major turn-off and make someone feel unappreciated. The author's intentions might have been to show that he's made sacrifices before, but the method used was hurtful. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not being more considerate and for invalidating her experience.\n"
