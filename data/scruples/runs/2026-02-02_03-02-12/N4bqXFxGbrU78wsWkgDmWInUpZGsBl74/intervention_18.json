We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend about her not wanting to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, context: They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend usually cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author is upset because he planned a special date night, but she called it off because of her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, suggesting she could put in more effort. She reacted strongly, yelling and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author planned something weeks in advance, and she knew about it. But when her period started that day, she wasn't up for it. He expressed his frustration, even if not angrily, by comparing her to other women. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which makes the author question his actions.\n\nNow, considering the broader picture. Periods can cause severe cramps, fatigue, and other symptoms that make it hard for some people to function. The author seems aware of this, as he mentions \"girls get cramps and shit during shark week,\" but it's clear he's struggling with the unpredictability and the impact on their plans.\n\nThe problem here is the comparison. Saying that other women he's known don't act like this implies that her behavior is abnormal or excessive. Even if his intention was to encourage her, the way he phrased it\u2014comparing her to others\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her real pain. It's possible that the girlfriend felt invalidated, leading to her strong reaction.\n\nCommunication is a big issue here. The author expected her to make an effort despite her period, but he didn't consider how she might feel about his comparison. The girlfriend's response suggests that she felt criticized and not supported. It's possible that the author didn't realize how hurtful his words were, even if he wasn't angry.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, empathy and understanding are crucial. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. His comment about other women could come across as a criticism implying that her pain isn't valid compared to others. This could have triggered her emotional response because she felt attacked.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but his approach to addressing it was problematic. The key issue is the lack of consideration for her feelings and the choice to compare her situation to others, which is a common trigger for hurt feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling unappreciated or criticized during a vulnerable time.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a reasonable expression of frustration or if they crossed a line by dismissing her experience. Given the girlfriend's strong reaction and the nature of the comment, it's likely the author's approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
