We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she started her period that day. He said that other women he's lived with don't act like this, implying she should put in more effort. She got really angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why he's upset. He put effort into planning this date, reserved a table, bought tickets, and dressed up. He had a right to be disappointed when the plans fell through. But the key here is how he expressed his feelings. He says he wasn't angry, just a little passive-aggressive. He brought up other women he's known, comparing his girlfriend to them. That might be where the problem is. \n\nComparing your partner to others is often a bad idea. It can come off as dismissive of her feelings and needs. Even if he meant it as a suggestion, the way he phrased it could make her feel like her pain isn't valid. Menstrual cramps can be really painful, and some people do need to rest. By saying other women don't act that way, he might have invalidated her experience, which could be why she got so upset.\n\nAlso, the fact that she canceled even though she knew about the plans weeks in advance might mean she's struggling with the pain. Maybe she tried her best but couldn't make it. The author's comment about her effort could be perceived as not understanding her physical limitations. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of making comparisons, he might have expressed his disappointment and discussed ways to find a compromise next time. For example, maybe a different activity if she's not feeling up to going out. But instead, he made a generalization that hurt her feelings. \n\nSo, even though he had a valid reason to be disappointed, the way he communicated his feelings was hurtful. Comparing her to other women and suggesting she could try harder might not be the right approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his words were likely dismissive and hurtful, even if his intention wasn't to be mean.\n"
