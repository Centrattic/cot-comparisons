We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They had a special date night planned, but she canceled because she was on her period. He mentioned that she's usually laid back and he's been with her for three months. He's comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act this way. After he made a passive-aggressive comment, she got extremely upset, called him names, and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether it's reasonable for him to get upset about her canceling plans during her period. On one hand, he planned things in advance, and she knew about it. But periods can be unpredictable, and she's clearly in pain. He's comparing her to other women, which might not be fair. Each person's experience with menstruation is different. Cramps can be debilitating for some, even if others don't have that reaction. \n\nHe says he's not angry but passive-aggressive. That might come off as dismissive of her pain. By saying other women don't act like this, he's implying she's overreacting or not trying hard enough. That's probably hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt her needs weren't being acknowledged. \n\nCommunication is key here. Maybe he should have expressed his feelings without comparing her to others. However, expecting her to push through pain to keep plans might not be realistic. But the way he approached it was likely the problem. He didn't validate her feelings, which led to conflict.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his comment was dismissive and invalidating. He should have acknowledged her pain and found a compromise instead of making a passive-aggressive remark based on comparisons to others.\n"
