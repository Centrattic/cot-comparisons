We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. They had a special date night planned, but she canceled because she was on her period. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, and that's what caused her to blow up.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is frustrated because the plans were made weeks in advance and his girlfriend knew about it. But she called him out for being an asshole. The key points are communication, empathy, and expectations.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing his feelings, which is okay. But the way he did it, comparing his current girlfriend to others, might be where he's wrong. Comparing partners to others is generally a bad idea because everyone has different needs and body responses. Also, the author assumes that she's not putting in enough effort, which might not be fair. Periods can be really painful and affect people differently. Even if others handle it differently, that doesn't mean his girlfriend is wrong to need rest.\n\nHe also mentions that she started crying and locked herself in her room. That's a strong reaction, which might indicate that his words were hurtful. The passive-aggressive comment about other women could have made her feel disrespected or invalidated. Even if he wasn't angry, bringing up past relationships in a comparison is a red flag.\n\nThe author might not realize that his girlfriend's needs are valid. She's experiencing pain, and maybe she's already struggling with feeling unappreciated or misunderstood. His reaction could have been seen as dismissive of her health. The fact that she didn't communicate better might be a separate issue, but the author's approach in this situation definitely contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's mistake was in how he communicated his frustration, especially by comparing her to other women. That's a common mistake in relationships where expectations aren't aligned. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong because of the comparison and lack of empathy in his response.\n"
