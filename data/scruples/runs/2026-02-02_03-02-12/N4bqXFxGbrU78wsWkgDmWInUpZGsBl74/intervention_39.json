We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels their date because she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which he's usually okay with. But this time, he had a special date planned weeks in advance. She knew about it, but still canceled because she started her period. He made a comment about other women he's known not acting this way, which led to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and understanding. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014he put effort into planning a special night and felt it was unfair. However, comparing his current girlfriend to others might come off as dismissive of her feelings and her specific situation. Even if he meant it to encourage her to make an effort, the way he phrased it could have hurt her feelings, especially if she was already in pain or feeling down due to her period.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but it shows that the comment hit a nerve. The author's passive-aggressive comment about other women might have made her feel judged or not supported. Even if she canceled the plans, the way he expressed his disappointment might have been hurtful. It's important to validate her feelings and offer support instead of making comparisons.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might not have been malicious, the approach was flawed. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
