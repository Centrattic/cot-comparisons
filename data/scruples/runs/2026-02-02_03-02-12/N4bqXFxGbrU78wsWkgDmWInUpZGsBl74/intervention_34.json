We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and he got upset and mentioned that other women he's known don't act that way. The girlfriend had a huge reaction, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author planned a special date night, which he mentions was scheduled weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. She decided to cancel because she started her period. The author expressed his frustration by saying other women he's lived with don't act this way, implying she's not making enough effort. \n\nNow, the key points: The author's comment compared his current girlfriend to other women he's known. Comparing one's partner to others is often a no-no in relationships. Even if the author wasn't angry, making such a comparison can come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings and needs. Period cramps can be severe for some people, and while others might manage, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the comment hurt her deeply.\n\nThe author might argue that he's being understanding most of the time, but this one time he couldn't handle the cancellation. However, the way he communicated his frustration was problematic. Using passive-aggressive comments and comparisons can be hurtful and disrespectful. Even if the author felt justified, the method of expressing that frustration was not appropriate. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend locking herself in her room and the prolonged silence indicate that the communication broke down. The author might not have considered how his words would affect her emotionally. It's possible that the girlfriend felt criticized and unappreciated, leading to her outburst.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences without comparisons. The author's statement undermines her experience and could make her feel like her needs aren't important. While the author might have had valid feelings of frustration, the way he expressed them was harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
