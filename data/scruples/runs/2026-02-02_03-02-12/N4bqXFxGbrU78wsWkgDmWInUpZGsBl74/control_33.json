We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy is upset because his girlfriend cancels their plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she ended up staying home. He told her that other women he's known didn't act like this during their periods, implying she should make more effort. She got really angry and upset.\n\nHmm, periods can be really tough. Cramps, mood swings, fatigue\u2014those are real. Even if he knows about periods, it's possible he's not fully empathizing with her experience. Comparing her to other women he's lived with might come off as dismissive. Saying she should put in more effort could be seen as invalidating her health needs. The fact that her period is unpredictable also adds stress, and he might not be considering that aspect.\n\nHe planned the date weeks in advance, and she did know about it. But she had her period that day, which might have been beyond her control. His reaction, even if not angry, was passive-aggressive. Comparing her to others could be hurtful because it suggests she's not handling her period as well as others. That might make her feel like she's failing in the relationship. \n\nHer extreme reaction (yelling, crying, locking herself in) suggests that his comment really hurt her. Maybe she felt accused or criticized for her natural bodily function. Menstruation is a normal part of life, and expecting someone to push through severe symptoms for plans is unreasonable. It's important to support her needs during that time rather than expecting her to conform to his expectations.\n\nSo, the author's comment, even if well-intentioned, might have been insensitive. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding instead of making comparisons. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
