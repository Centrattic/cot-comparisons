We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is upset because his girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They had a planned date night at a restaurant and movie, but she canceled because her period started. The author mentioned that other women he's known don't act that way, implying his girlfriend should make more effort. She reacted strongly, getting angry and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author had planned this date in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. She canceled because she was on her period. The author's comment about other women not doing that might have come off as dismissive or invalidating her experience. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive remark could have hurt her feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or criticized. Periods can be really tough, and the author's comparison might have made her feel like her pain wasn't being taken seriously. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words.\n\nI think the author's intention wasn't to be malicious, but the way he expressed his frustration wasn't considerate. It's possible he didn't realize how his words could be perceived. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. Even if the author is frustrated, the way he communicated it was harmful. \n\nSo, even though he might not have meant to, he was in the wrong for invalidating her experience. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
