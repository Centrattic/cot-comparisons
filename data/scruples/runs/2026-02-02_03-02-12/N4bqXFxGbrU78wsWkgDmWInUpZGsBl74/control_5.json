We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is on her period, which for the first two days makes her not want to do anything. She cancels plans, stays home, watches Netflix, etc. The author usually puts up with it, but in one instance, he got impatient. He had planned a special date night weeks in advance, and she started her period on that day. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act this way, implying she should make more of an effort. She got extremely upset, yelled at him, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period. He's upset because she didn't show up to the special date he planned. He made a comment comparing her to other women, suggesting she's not trying hard enough. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to respect each other's needs. Menstrual cramps can be severe and affect people differently. The author mentions that her periods come at a \"semi-random time,\" which makes it hard to plan around. But he had planned this specific date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. However, she still started her period that day. \n\nThe key point here is that the author criticized his partner for something that's a natural part of her body's cycle. Even if he's trying to be passive-aggressive and not angry, making a comparison to other women and suggesting she should put in more effort is likely to be hurtful. It's possible that he didn't realize the extent of her discomfort or that she felt she had no choice but to cancel. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but it shows that the author's words really hurt her. She might feel that he's dismissing her pain or not understanding her needs. In a healthy relationship, partners support each other, especially during times when one might be unwell. The fact that the author had to plan around her period but she couldn't adjust might not be in her control. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Instead of making a passive-aggressive comment, the author could have discussed his feelings more directly, maybe expressing his disappointment without blaming her. However, he chose to criticize her behavior, which led to a breakdown in communication and an emotional outburst from her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was likely hurtful and dismissive of her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the way he expressed his frustration was not constructive. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
