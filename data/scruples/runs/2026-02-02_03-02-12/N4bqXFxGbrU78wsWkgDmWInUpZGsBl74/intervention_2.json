We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where the author got upset with their girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. The author compared her to previous women they lived with, implying she's not making enough effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a planned date night, which was important to them. They expressed their feelings, maybe a bit passive-aggressively, by comparing their current girlfriend to past partners. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, involving anger and crying. \n\nThe key points are communication style and empathy. The author's comment about other women might come off as dismissive of their current partner's needs. Even if the author meant to express frustration, bringing up past relationships can be hurtful. It might imply the current partner isn't measuring up, which is a common trigger for defensiveness. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's needs are valid. Menstrual cramps can be severe and affect daily activities. The author acknowledged that in the beginning. However, the way they conveyed their frustration might have undermined the girlfriend's experience. Instead of expressing their own feelings of disappointment, the author made a comparison that could feel like a criticism of her behavior. \n\nEffective communication usually involves expressing one's own feelings without blaming the other person. The author might have been better off saying, \"I felt disappointed when the plans got canceled, but I understand if you're not up for it. Maybe we can find a way to make it work next time?\" Instead, they used a comparison that could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's emotional reaction and the potential insensitivity in the author's approach, it's likely the author is in the wrong. They didn't validate her situation and instead compared her to others, which can be hurtful. The author's comment, even if not angry, was a passive-aggressive way to express their feelings, which might not be the healthiest approach in a relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their communication was dismissive and potentially hurtful, even if their intention was to express disappointment.\n"
