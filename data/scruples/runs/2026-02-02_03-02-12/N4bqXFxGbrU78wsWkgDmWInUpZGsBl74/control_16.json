We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a boyfriend who got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their date night when she was on her period. He planned it weeks in advance, but she didn't show up because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she could put more effort in. She got really upset, yelled at him, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective is that he had a special plan, she canceled without considering his effort, and he felt justified in saying other women manage to go out. His girlfriend's reaction was intense, so he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFrom his point of view, he might feel like he's being reasonable. He planned in advance, she knew about it, but she still canceled. He might think she could have tried harder. But the key here is comparing his past experiences with other women. That's a problem. When he says \"I know other women who don't act like this,\" that's a comparison that's not fair. Every person's experience with menstruation is different. What's manageable for one person might not be for another. By bringing up other women, he's dismissing her individual experience and making her feel like her needs are invalid.\n\nAlso, the fact that she had a strong reaction\u2014yelling, crying, locking herself in a room\u2014suggests that his comment really hurt her. Even if he didn't mean to be angry, the passive-aggressive remark about other women probably made her feel criticized and unappreciated. She might feel that he's not supporting her during a time when she's already struggling.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might not have realized how his words would come across. He might have intended to express frustration but in a way that's hurtful. The comparison to other women is a classic red flag in relationships. It's not about who's right or wrong in terms of physical ability but about communication and empathy. The author should have tried to understand her situation rather than comparing her to others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's mistake was using a comparison to other women, which invalidated his girlfriend's feelings. Even if he was upset, the way he expressed it was hurtful. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
