We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling their date night because she's on her period. He had planned it weeks in advance, and she was aware of it. When she canceled, he made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not making enough effort. She then got extremely upset, leading to a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that his girlfriend usually cancels everything when she's on her period, and this time was no different. He's frustrated because he made plans and she didn't follow through. However, the way he handled it was to passively-aggressively compare her to other women, which he admits was passive-aggressive. Comparing someone to others, especially in a sensitive situation like this, is generally a bad move. It can come off as dismissive of her feelings and invalidating her experience.\n\nMenstruation can be painful and affect people differently. Even if some people manage to go out, others might genuinely struggle. The author's comment suggests that he doesn't understand her need to rest and instead is holding her to a standard based on his previous experiences with other women. That's a classic example of not empathizing with his partner's situation and instead criticizing her for not meeting his expectations.\n\nHe planned the date knowing her period can be unpredictable, which might have been a factor in the conflict. However, the key issue here is his reaction. Telling someone that others handle their periods better, even if in a casual tone, can be hurtful. It undermines her feelings and makes her feel like her needs are less valid. The girlfriend's strong reaction is a sign that his words deeply hurt her, which makes sense given the context.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's approach was flawed. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. Instead of expressing his frustration constructively, he used a comparison that likely made her feel judged and unappreciated. This is a common mistake in relationships where one partner's needs aren't being met, but the method of addressing it is crucial. The answer here is likely that the author is in the wrong because his approach was hurtful and invalidating.\n"
