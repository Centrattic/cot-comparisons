We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset because of it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author is trying to understand but also finds frustrating. The key point here is the author's comment that other women he's lived with don't act this way. He suggested she could put in more effort for him. The girlfriend reacted strongly, which led to a conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue is about boundaries and empathy. The author's comment about other women is problematic because it's a comparison that can be hurtful. It's like implying that his girlfriend is not handling her period properly compared to others. That's a classic move that can make someone feel judged. The author might not realize how dismissive that sounds towards her feelings and physical state.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction shows that this issue is significant to her. She locked herself in her room and was very emotional. That suggests she felt hurt or attacked. The author probably didn't mean to be cruel, but the way he framed his comment could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author tried to express his feelings, but maybe without enough sensitivity. It's important to validate someone's feelings before making comparisons. The fact that they had plans and she still canceled might have added to his frustration, but he could have handled it differently.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's mistake was making the comparison and implying that she should be able to push through her discomfort more than others. That's where the hurt comes in. The girlfriend's strong reaction is a sign that this crossed a line. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
