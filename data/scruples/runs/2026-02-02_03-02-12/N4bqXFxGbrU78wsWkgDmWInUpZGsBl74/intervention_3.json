We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned a special date night, which he put effort into weeks in advance. His girlfriend knew about it, but when she got her period, she canceled. He expressed frustration, comparing her to other women he's known who don't act this way, which led to her blowing up at him.\n\nSo, from his perspective, he feels his effort was wasted and maybe unappreciated. He might think she could manage a little more effort for him. But from her side, she's dealing with a period, which can be very painful. She might feel invalidated or criticized when he brings up other women. Comparing her to others can be hurtful, especially if she's already in pain and stressed.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author's comment about other women might come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, pointing out that others don't act like this can make her feel like her pain isn't legitimate. Also, the fact that she locked herself in her room and cried shows how much that comment affected her.\n\nI think the author's frustration is understandable, but his approach was flawed. Instead of making a comparison, he could have expressed his disappointment and asked how they could handle the situation better. His comment about other women probably made her feel judged, which escalated the conflict.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. He should have handled the situation with more empathy and understanding, avoiding comparisons that might make her feel invalidated.\n"
