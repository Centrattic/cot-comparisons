We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about their girlfriend canceling plans when she's on her period, and the author got upset and made a comment comparing her to other women they've known, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend cancels plans every month for a few days when she's on her period. The author understands that periods can be rough but feels it's affecting their plans. They had a special date night planned, which the girlfriend canceled, and the author made a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting that way. The girlfriend then had a strong emotional reaction.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's side, they planned something special and were expecting the girlfriend to make an effort. They might feel their efforts were disregarded. However, comparing the girlfriend to other women could be seen as dismissive of her experience with period symptoms. Even if well-intentioned, it's a comparison that might hurt and invalidate her feelings. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she's dealing with physical discomfort and emotional changes during her period. She might feel that her needs aren't being respected, especially when her partner is bringing up other women's experiences. The fact that she locked herself in her room and cried shows the impact of the comment. \n\nThe key here is communication and empathy. The author wanted to express frustration but did so in a way that might have been hurtful. Even if they weren't angry, the passive-aggressive comment could have been a trigger for the girlfriend, especially if she already feels vulnerable or stressed about her period. Comparing her to others might make her feel judged or inadequate.\n\nSo, while the author might feel justified in wanting to spend time together, the way they expressed their frustration (comparing her to others) might have been the issue. It's possible the author didn't realize how that comparison could hurt, showing a lack of consideration for her feelings. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences rather than compare. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that the comment was particularly harsh and hurtful, even if the author didn't mean it as a direct attack.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's comment likely crossed a line by invalidating the girlfriend's experience. Even if they had good intentions, the method of communication led to a major conflict. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility here.\n"
