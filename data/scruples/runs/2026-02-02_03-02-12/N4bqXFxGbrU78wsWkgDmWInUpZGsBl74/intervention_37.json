We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset when she cancels their special date night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a special date weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled because she started her period. The author expressed frustration, comparing her behavior to other women he's known who don't act that way. The girlfriend had a strong reaction, getting angry and crying.\n\nFrom a general perspective, it's well-known that women can experience painful symptoms during their periods, and it's common for some to feel unwell enough that they don't want to go out. However, the author had given the girlfriend prior notice of the plans, so she should have known. But maybe her period can be unpredictable, as she mentioned it comes semi-randomly.\n\nThe author's comment about other women might have been a mistake. Comparing his current girlfriend to others can be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, saying other women don't act like that implies he thinks she's overreacting or not making enough effort. That could be seen as invalidating her experience with her period. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had planned something special and was probably looking forward to it. Feeling let down is understandable, but how he expressed his frustration might have been inappropriate. The key issue is communication. Instead of comparing her to others, he might have handled it differently, maybe by being more understanding or asking how she's feeling instead of putting pressure on her to go out despite her discomfort.\n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that her period pain is significant, and the author's comment triggered her. It's possible she felt disrespected or unappreciated. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author's approach may have been dismissive, leading to her emotional response.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and didn't take into account her actual experience. Even if his intention was to express disappointment, the way he did it was harmful. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
