We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as great, and they've been living together for three months. The issue is that during the first two days of her period, she cancels everything and wants to stay home. The author usually puts up with this but got upset when she canceled a special date they had planned weeks in advance. He mentioned that other women he's known didn't act this way and suggested she could put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted very negatively, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, thinking about empathy and communication. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since he had planned something special. However, comparing his current partner to others is usually a bad move. Phrases like \"I know other women who don't act like this\" can come across as invalidating. It's important to acknowledge her feelings and needs without making her feel like she's being compared to others.\n\nHer period is a natural and common experience, and cramps can be quite painful. The fact that she's usually laid back and kind suggests that this incident might have been a culmination of previous frustrations. The author's comment about other women could have triggered her, making her feel unappreciated or not taken seriously. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but his approach in expressing that frustration was not constructive. He should have addressed his feelings without comparing her to others. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling criticized or not supported. \n\nSo, while the author has valid feelings, the way he communicated them was problematic. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for how he expressed his frustration rather than the frustration itself.\n"
