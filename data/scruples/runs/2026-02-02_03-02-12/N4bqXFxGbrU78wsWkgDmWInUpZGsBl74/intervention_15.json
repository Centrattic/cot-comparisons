We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation involves a planned date night that she couldn't attend due to her period, and he made a comment comparing her behavior to other women's.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as great otherwise, but she has this issue with her period. The author had planned a special date, which she had known about weeks in advance. On the day of the event, she started her period and decided to cancel. The author expressed his frustration by saying that other women he's known don't act this way, implying his girlfriend could put in more effort. This led to a major argument.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key here is the author's comment about other women. Even if his tone wasn't angry, making a comparison like that can come off as dismissive or invalidating. It suggests that her experience isn't as valid or that she should be able to push through, which isn't considerate of her actual physical and emotional state during her period. \n\nAdditionally, the author had scheduled the date knowing her cycle could be unpredictable. While he planned ahead, periods can be irregular, and expecting others to always accommodate might be unrealistic. The fact that she knew about the plan but still canceled might frustrate him, but the way he communicated his frustration was the problem. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was severe, but her emotional response could be due to feeling disrespected or invalidated. The author's comment, though not shouted, was passive-aggressive and compared her to others, which can be hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author might not have malicious intent, but his words disregarded her feelings and health. It's important to acknowledge her valid experience without comparing her to others. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did make a mistake in his approach. He's in the wrong for how he expressed his frustration, even if his intention was to express disappointment. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
