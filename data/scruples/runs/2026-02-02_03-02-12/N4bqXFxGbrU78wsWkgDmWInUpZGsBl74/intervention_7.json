We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset that his girlfriend cancels their plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she started her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, who don't act like that. His girlfriend was really upset, yelling and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both perspectives. The author's argument is that he's being reasonable and that other women he's known don't cancel plans when on their period. He's feeling let down because he made plans in advance and she knew about them. But his response was to make a passive-aggressive comment about other women, which probably hurt her feelings and made her feel criticized.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is dealing with menstrual cramps, which can be really painful. She's clearly in pain and maybe not in the mood for social activities. Her reaction, while intense, might be a sign of feeling attacked. Comparing her to other women in a negative way could make her feel like her pain isn't valid or that she's being judged.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author expected her to put in more effort, but maybe didn't consider how she's feeling physically. Menstrual cycles can be unpredictable, as he mentioned, so planning around them is hard. His comment about other women might have been a trigger, making her feel like she's not being supported during a tough time.\n\nI think the author's criticism is valid in that he wants her to make an effort, but the way he communicated it was hurtful. Comparing her to others in a negative light isn't constructive and can damage trust. The girlfriend's reaction, while strong, might be a result of feeling misunderstood or criticized when she's already in pain.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. If the author had expressed his disappointment without making a comparison, maybe she would have felt more supported. Instead, his approach made her feel attacked, leading to a bigger conflict. So, while he might have had a valid feeling of being let down, the way he handled it was flawed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way he addressed the situation.\n"
