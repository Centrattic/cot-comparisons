We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend is on her period and cancels plans, which the author finds frustrating. He planned a special date night, but she canceled last minute. He told her that other women he's lived with don't act like that, implying she's not making enough effort. Then she reacted strongly.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach might be problematic. Comparing his current girlfriend to past partners is a classic \"you're not like other people\" move, which can be really hurtful. He didn't express his feelings in a respectful way. Instead of communicating his needs or understanding her situation, he criticized her, which led to a big argument.\n\nPeriod-related discomfort is real and varies per person. Some might handle it better, but it's not fair to judge someone else's experience. The author planned the night knowing her cycle, but maybe didn't consider that even with planning, she might still feel unwell. However, his response was passive-aggressive and dismissive of her needs. \n\nHe should have perhaps asked how she's feeling instead of making comparisons. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a sign that his words hurt her deeply. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests the communication broke down because of his approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was the trigger. Even if he was frustrated, the way he expressed it was invalidating. He's in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with empathy and instead used a hurtful comparison. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
