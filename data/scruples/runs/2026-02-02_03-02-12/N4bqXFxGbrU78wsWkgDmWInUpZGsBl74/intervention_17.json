We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The key points here are communication issues and differing expectations.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which he's usually okay with. But this time, after planning a special date, he expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's known. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling him an asshole and crying. \n\nThe main issue seems to be how the author communicated his feelings. Instead of discussing his feelings of disappointment or maybe suggesting alternatives, he made a passive-aggressive comment about other women. Comparing her to others in a situation where she's already not feeling well can come off as dismissive and hurtful. \n\nEven if the author is feeling overlooked in his plans, the way he chose to address it was probably not the best approach. It's important to validate her feelings and needs during her period. Suggesting that others don't act this way might invalidate her experience and make her feel like she's being criticized for her body's natural response. \n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that the comment deeply hurt her. The fact that they haven't talked directly since suggests that the communication breakdown is significant. The author needs to consider how his words might have made her feel unappreciated or judged. \n\nAdditionally, the author could have approached the situation by asking if there was a way to modify the plans to accommodate her discomfort, rather than expressing frustration in a way that could be seen as passive-aggressive. \n\nIn relationships, empathy and understanding are crucial. The author's comment, while maybe not intended to be harsh, still came off as critical. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n"
