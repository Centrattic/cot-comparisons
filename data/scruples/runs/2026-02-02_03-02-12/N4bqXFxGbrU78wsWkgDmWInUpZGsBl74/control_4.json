We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live together, she's been great otherwise, but during her period, she's really inactive. The main issue is that she cancels plans, especially a special date night they had planned weeks in advance. The author planned a dinner and movie, but she called off because her period started that day. He mentioned other women he's known didn't act like this, implying she should make more effort. She got extremely upset and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm. The key points here are his reaction. He says he wasn't angry but maybe passive-aggressive. Comparing her to other women he's lived with is probably a big part of the problem. That's a common issue in relationships\u2014assuming someone else's experience is the standard. Women's experiences with periods vary a lot; some might feel awful, others not as much. But telling her that others don't act this way can come off as dismissive of her pain. \n\nHe might not realize that his comment minimized her discomfort. Even if he meant to encourage her, the way he brought up other women could be hurtful. She might feel like he's judging her, which is why she reacted so strongly. Also, planning a date night weeks in advance but not considering her cycle's unpredictability could be an issue. Maybe he should have checked in closer to the date or adjusted plans if her period was about to start.\n\nBut wait, the author did mention he knows periods are tough, so maybe he's genuinely confused why she can't push through. However, everyone's pain tolerance and symptoms differ. Some days are worse than others. The fact that she's been living together for three months and he's still trying to schedule around her unpredictable cycle shows maybe a lack of communication. They should talk about her cycle and plan accordingly, but the author's approach here was to compare her to others, which isn't helpful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's comment about other women is problematic. It's not fair to hold someone to a standard based on other people's experiences. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that his words were deeply hurtful. He might not have intended to, but his words implied that her pain isn't valid compared to other women. So, the answer here is likely that the author is in the wrong because his response was dismissive and judgmental, even if not shouted angrily. The passive-aggressive comment about other women is a classic relationship faux pas, leading to her emotional outburst.\n"
