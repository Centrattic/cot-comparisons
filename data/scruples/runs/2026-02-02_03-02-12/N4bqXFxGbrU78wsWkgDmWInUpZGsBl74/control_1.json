We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author planned a special date night with their girlfriend, who called it off because she was on her period. The author then made a comment comparing their ex-girlfriends and implying that his current girlfriend isn't making enough effort. The girlfriend got really upset, yelled, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are communication, empathy, and expectations. The author planned something special in advance, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend had clearly communicated her needs when she's on her period, which is a known issue. The author says he knows she gets cramps and usually puts up with it, but in this case, he got impatient.\n\nThe main issue is the author's comment about other women. Comparing one's partner to past relationships is often a no-go because it can be hurtful and dismissive of the current partner's feelings. Even if the author wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have crossed a line. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the comment hit a sensitive spot. She might have felt disrespected or that her pain wasn't being acknowledged.\n\nAlso, the author's expectation that she should make more effort despite her discomfort could be unrealistic. Periods can be physically and emotionally challenging for some women, and each person's experience varies. The author might not fully grasp the severity of her symptoms, leading to a lack of empathy. The fact that her period comes at a \"semi-random time\" adds to the unpredictability, which the author admits makes scheduling hard. Yet, he still expected her to stick to the plans, which might not be fair if she's genuinely unwell.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to balance his own desires (a special date) with her needs. The way he expressed his frustration was through comparison and implying she's worse than others, which can be really damaging. Healthy communication would involve expressing his feelings without belittling her. Maybe he should have asked how she was feeling instead of making a judgment.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction was also extreme. Yelling and crying might indicate deeper issues, like feeling undervalued or a history of such comments. But in this case, the author's approach was likely the catalyst. He should have considered her perspective and found a way to address his disappointment without being dismissive.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's comment was probably the wrong move. Even if he had valid feelings of being let down, the way he expressed them was hurtful and lacked empathy, making him at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n"
