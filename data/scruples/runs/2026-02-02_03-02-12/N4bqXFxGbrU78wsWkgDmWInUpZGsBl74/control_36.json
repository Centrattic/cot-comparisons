We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author is okay with most of the time. But one time, he had a special date night planned, and she canceled because her period started. He told her he's seen other women not act like that even when on their periods, implying she should make more of an effort. She got extremely upset, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo the key points here are: communication, empathy, and expectations. The author's comment about other women suggests he's comparing her to others, which can be hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, being passive-aggressive about it might have come off as dismissive of her feelings and physical discomfort. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014losing her cool and crying\u2014indicates that his words really hurt her. It's possible she felt he was invalidating her pain or implying she's being overly dramatic. Menstrual issues can be severe for some people, leading to cramps, fatigue, mood swings, etc. The author might not fully grasp the impact of his words.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the situation escalated. The author's approach might have been a breach of trust or empathy. Even if he thought he was being reasonable, the way he communicated his feelings could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably is in the wrong. He should have approached the situation with more understanding and discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. The girlfriend's needs and health should be respected, especially when they've been living together and he's aware of her usual behavior during her period. His frustration led to a hurtful comment, making him at fault here.\n"
