We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend when she cancels plans during her period. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend cancels all plans for the first two days of her period, even when they're planned in advance. He tried to plan a special date night, but she canceled last minute when her period started. He expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, which made her lose her temper.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's main issue is that he expected his girlfriend to make an effort despite her period. But periods can be really painful and cause significant discomfort for some women. It's not just about \"acting out\"\u2014it's a physical condition. The author's comment about other women not acting this way implies that his girlfriend is overreacting or not trying hard enough, which can be dismissive of her actual experience.\n\nAlso, the fact that her period timing is unpredictable adds to the difficulty in planning. The author had planned weeks in advance, and she knew about it, but when her period started that day, she felt unable to go. His frustration is understandable, but his approach was passive-aggressive and compared her to others, which might have hurt her feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt invalidated or criticized. The author's comment might have made her feel like she wasn't being supported during a time when she's already struggling. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark could have been a trigger.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her physical discomfort and instead made a comparison that could be seen as belittling her experience. Relationships require understanding and empathy, especially during times when one partner is unwell. The author's approach lacked empathy and might have been dismissive of her needs. \n\nSo, the answer here is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction wasn't supportive and he didn't validate her experience with her period, which is a legitimate health issue.\n"
