We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author got frustrated, made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known, and now she's really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is usually laid back and great, but during her period, she cancels everything. The author plans a special date night, but she calls it off. He expresses his frustration by saying other women don't act this way, which upsets her a lot. She reacts strongly, which he wasn't expecting.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is expecting his partner to push through her discomfort to keep plans they both agreed to weeks in advance. But periods can be really painful and debilitating for some people. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings\u2014those are real and vary from person to person. The author's comment about other women he's known implies that her reaction is excessive or that she's not making enough effort, which can come off as dismissive of her pain or needs.\n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be angry, using a passive-aggressive remark about other women's behavior is a bit of a comparison that can be hurtful. It's also not considering that everyone's experience with periods is different. His frustration about not being able to schedule around it might be valid, but the way he expressed it was probably not the best approach.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment hit a nerve. She's defensive and upset, which suggests that feeling compared unfavorably to others was a trigger. The author's statement could be seen as invalidating her experience, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. Respecting her needs and communication about how to handle such situations would be healthier than making comparative criticisms.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because his comment was dismissive and didn't validate her feelings. Even if he's had other experiences where women didn't cancel, everyone's different. The key issue is not the period itself but how he communicated his frustration, which was hurtful and unhelpful. He should have approached it with more empathy and understanding instead of making a judgmental remark.\n"
