We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend when she canceled their plans because of her period. He planned a special date night, but she was on her period and decided to stay home. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which led to her getting extremely upset and them not talking since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions that his girlfriend usually cancels plans when she's on her period, and he's been putting up with it. But this time, he felt like she wasn't making an effort, especially since she knew about the plans in advance. He comments that other women he's known don't act this way, implying that his girlfriend is being unreasonable.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's comment, even if not said angrily, was passive-aggressive. Comparing his girlfriend to other women is a classic no-no. It's hurtful because it suggests she isn't meeting his expectations and that others are better. This can make someone feel criticized and undervalued. \n\nPMS or her period can cause mood swings and physical discomfort. Even if she knew about the plans, the pain might be unexpected or more severe than usual. The author planning in advance is good, but expecting her to go out despite being unwell might not be realistic. It's important to empathize and be flexible. However, the author's approach was to criticize her instead of showing understanding.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, which might be because she felt her needs were dismissed or she felt attacked. Her locking herself in and crying shows the emotional impact of his words. The author might not realize that his comment was hurtful, but the fact that it caused such a strong reaction indicates that he was in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and support. The author should have tried to understand her situation rather than making her feel inadequate. Even if he's frustrated, expressing it in a way that compares her to others is disrespectful. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
