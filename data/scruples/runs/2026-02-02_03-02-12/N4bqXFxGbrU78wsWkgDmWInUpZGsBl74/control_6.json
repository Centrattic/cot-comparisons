We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend is usually laid back and nice, but during her period, she's uninterested in plans and stays home. The author mentions that her period comes at a semi-random time each month, making it hard to plan around. They had a special date night planned, but she canceled because her period started that day. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she should make more effort. This led to a big argument where she was very upset.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. He planned a date knowing her period could come at any time. Even though he knew in advance, he didn't adjust the plans when she had her period. His comment about other women probably came off as dismissive of her genuine pain, even if he wasn't angry. Comparing her to other people is a common issue in relationships and can be hurtful, even if not intended. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she was already in pain and stressed. The author's comment might have invalidated her feelings. Even if he had a valid point about planning ahead, the way he communicated it was probably not respectful. Relationships require empathy and understanding, especially when a partner is unwell. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not just in being upset but in how he expressed his frustration. The key issue is respecting her needs during her period, which is a valid health concern. He might not have intended to hurt her, but the comment was probably hurtful and dismissive. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
