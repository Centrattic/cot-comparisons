We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author gets upset because she didn't go along with their special date night. The author compared his current girlfriend to other women he's lived with, implying she should put in more effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is on her period, which is a natural part of life, and she's clearly experiencing discomfort. The author had planned the date in advance, and she knew about it. However, when her period started that day, she couldn't go. The author then made a comment about other women not acting this way, which upset her.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and communication. The author's comment about other women could come off as dismissive of her feelings and her body's needs. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have invalidated her experience. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might feel criticized for her natural response to pain or discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that her period comes at a \"semi-random time every month.\" So, there's a lack of predictability, which makes planning difficult. The author's frustration is understandable, but handling it by making a passive-aggressive comment instead of discussing it calmly might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author didn't consider how his words would affect her, especially given that she was already in pain and stressed about missing the plans.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other through health issues. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't respecting her needs, and the author might feel unappreciated for his efforts. The problem here is the communication style. The author's approach was to compare her to others, which isn't helpful. Instead, working together to find a solution, like rescheduling or adjusting plans, would be better.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
