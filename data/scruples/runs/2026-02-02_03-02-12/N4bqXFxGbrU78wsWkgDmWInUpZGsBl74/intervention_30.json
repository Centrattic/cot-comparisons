We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cancels their plans when she's on her period, and the author expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's known. The girlfriend then had a big emotional response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a special date night and had mentioned it in advance. He's upset because his girlfriend canceled last minute due to her period. He mentions that she's usually laid back but this was a specific instance where he felt let down. He compared her to other women, which might have been a mistake.\n\nBut on the other hand, periods can be really painful and debilitating for some women. The author acknowledges that she's \"getting her period\" and that it's a known issue. However, he might have dismissed her feelings by implying that other women don't act this way. Comparing her to others can come off as invalidating her experience, even if he didn't mean it angrily. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment hurt her feelings.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author overstep by making a comparison to other women, even if he was trying to express his feelings? The girlfriend's reaction indicates that the comment was hurtful. Even if the author was trying to communicate his disappointment, the way he did it might have been insensitive. The girlfriend might feel that her pain isn't being respected, especially if she's experiencing severe cramps.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of feeling disappointed, but the way he expressed it was probably inappropriate. He should have addressed his feelings without comparing her to others. So, the answer might be that he is in the wrong for how he communicated his feelings, even if his intention was to express his side.\n"
