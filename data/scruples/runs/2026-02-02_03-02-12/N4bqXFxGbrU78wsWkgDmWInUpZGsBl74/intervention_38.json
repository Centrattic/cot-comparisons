We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset because she canceled their planned date, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author made plans weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about them. But during her period, she canceled. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she should put in more effort. The girlfriend was very upset by this.\n\nFrom the author's side, he might feel that he put effort into planning a special night, and her canceling it without trying to compromise could be frustrating. However, periods can be really painful for some people, and expecting someone to go out despite that might be unreasonable. \n\nThe key point here is the author's comment about other women not acting that way. Comparing his girlfriend to others in a negative light, even passively, is likely hurtful. It suggests he's dismissing her feelings and implying that her reaction is excessive or not valid. That could be seen as invalidating her experience with her period, which is a sensitive issue. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be angry, the comparison is a classic example of gaslighting or minimizing someone's legitimate needs. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a response to feeling criticized and not supported. The author's approach might not be malicious, but it's definitely inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while the author's frustration is understandable, his method of addressing it was inappropriate. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding instead of making a passive-aggressive comment. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
