We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the boyfriend expressed frustration, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's dealing with physical discomfort and decides to stay home, which is a common experience for many women. The boyfriend planned a special date night weeks in advance, but the girlfriend canceled last minute. His frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might be the problem.\n\nThe key point here is his comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not making enough effort. That's where the issue lies. Even if he's not angry, making such a comparison can come off as dismissive of her feelings and physical state. It's important to validate a partner's experiences, especially during times of discomfort. By suggesting other women handle their periods better, he's invalidating her needs and possibly making her feel like she's not being supported.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but her emotional response is a sign of how hurtful his words were. The fact that they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. The boyfriend's intention might have been to express his disappointment, but the method was flawed. He should have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps discussing ways to support each other rather than making comparisons.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of focusing on what others do, he should focus on understanding her situation and finding solutions together. His comment, even if passive-aggressive, undermined her feelings and could be seen as blaming her for her body's natural cycle. That's generally not supportive behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the boyfriend is in the wrong here. He didn't handle his disappointment in a constructive way, and his words likely hurt her more than he intended. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
