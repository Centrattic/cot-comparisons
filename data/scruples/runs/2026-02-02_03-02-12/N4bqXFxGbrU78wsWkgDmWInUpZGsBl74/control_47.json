We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is upset with their girlfriend for not going out when she's on her period. They had a planned date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. The author mentioned that they told her that other women they've lived with don't act like this, implying she should put in more effort. Then the girlfriend got really angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main issue is that the girlfriend cancels plans during her period. They mention that it's semi-random and hard to schedule around, but they usually put up with it. However, this time was a special date night they planned weeks in advance. The key point is that the author expressed frustration by comparing her to other women they've known, suggesting she should try harder. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she called the author names, cried, and locked herself in her room. That's a big response. The question is whether the author's comment was valid or not. \n\nFrom a general perspective, menstrual cycles can cause cramps, pain, and fatigue. It's a natural biological process, and people do react differently. The author seems to expect that even with a period, she should be able to go out and participate in plans, especially if she was aware of the date in advance. However, the author's comment about other women not acting that way could be seen as invalidating her experience. Comparing her to other women might come off as dismissive of her feelings and physical discomfort. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author might think they're being reasonable, but bringing up past experiences with other women could make the girlfriend feel judged or compared. It's possible that the author's frustration led them to make a comment that hurt her feelings, even if it wasn't intended as an attack. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was a significant trigger for her.\n\nAlso, the author had planned this date night with effort, so they might feel their efforts were wasted. However, it's important to balance consideration for each other's needs. If the girlfriend is experiencing severe pain or discomfort, she might not be able to go, and the author might need to find a compromise or adjust their expectations. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's statement about other women might have been the catalyst for the argument. Even if the author was trying to express frustration constructively, the way it was phrased could be harmful. The girlfriend's emotional response indicates that the author crossed a line by undermining her feelings about her own body and needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the author's comment was inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. They might not have fully considered how their words would affect the girlfriend, especially when she's already in a vulnerable state due to her period. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making that comparison and not being more empathetic.\n"
