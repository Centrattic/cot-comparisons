We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend cancels their planned date night because she's on her period. The author got upset and made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is usually laid back and the author says she's great. The problem here is the period issue. The author had planned a special date weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. But she ended up canceling because her period started that day. The author expressed frustration, implying she's not making an effort, which upset her a lot.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, it's common for people to feel more tired or uncomfortable during their period. It's not uncommon for some women to prefer resting on the first day. However, the key points here are communication and respect. The author planned this knowing her cycle might be unpredictable, but he still went ahead. When she cancels, he responds by comparing her to other women, which can come off as dismissive of her experience. \n\nSaying that other women he's known don't act this way suggests he's invalidating her feelings. Even if he's not angry, passive-aggressive comments can still be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which might indicate that she felt criticized or not supported. \n\nThe author might not realize how his words could make her feel. Comparing her to others, even if not meant to be harsh, could make her feel like her pain isn't taken seriously. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that he made an effort to plan a nice date and was let down. But the way he expressed his frustration was probably not the healthiest approach. Communication is key in relationships, and instead of making a comparison, he might have expressed his disappointment and discussed how they can handle future plans.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because he invalidated her feelings and used a comparison that hurt her. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
