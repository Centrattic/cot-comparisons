We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that his girlfriend, who he generally likes a lot, becomes very unresponsive and cancels plans during her period. He had a special date night planned, but she had her period that day and canceled. He expressed his frustration by saying other women he's lived with don't act this way, which led to her getting extremely angry and crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had plans he worked hard to make, the girlfriend canceled because of her period, and he made a comparison to other women. The girlfriend reacted strongly emotionally. \n\nNow, considering the context of periods and cramps, it's a common experience for some women to feel unwell during their period. The author acknowledges that she has cramps, but he expected more effort on a special night. However, his comment about other women not acting this way could come off as dismissive of her needs. Comparing her to other women is a sensitive topic because everyone's experience with periods can vary. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014losing her temper and becoming emotional\u2014indicates that the comment hurt her deeply. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have made her feel unappreciated or criticized for her health. \n\nThe author's intention might have been to express his feelings about the planning and effort, but the way he communicated it was potentially hurtful. It's important to validate her experience and find a middle ground rather than making comparisons. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have approached the situation differently, perhaps by discussing his feelings without diminishing her experience. His response might have been inconsiderate, especially since he acknowledged knowing about her period in advance but still felt frustrated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment likely contributed to the conflict. He might be in the wrong for not being more supportive and for making a comparison that upset her. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
