We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. The key points here are the comparison he makes to other women he's lived with and his comment that she could put in more effort.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is clearly in pain and has a valid medical reason for not wanting to go out. Periods can cause cramps, fatigue, and other symptoms that make daily activities hard. The author acknowledges that women experience this, so he's not unaware. However, his response was to compare her to other women and imply she's not trying hard enough. That's where the issue lies.\n\nComparing partners to others is generally a bad idea because it can feel dismissive and invalidating. Even if he's not angry, saying others handle it better suggests she's failing in some way. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which indicates that his comment really hurt her feelings. She might feel that her pain isn't being respected, and instead of support, she gets criticism.\n\nThe author planned a special date night, which is good, but he didn't account for her needs during her period. Maybe he could have been more flexible or checked in with her before the plans. However, the main problem here is his response when things didn't go as planned. Instead of understanding her situation, he criticized her, which led to a major argument.\n\nSo, even though the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, the root cause is the author's comment. He should have communicated differently, perhaps expressing his disappointment without invalidating her experience. The fact that he's questioning his actions now shows he realizes something went wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his comment was hurtful and dismissive of her legitimate needs.\n"
