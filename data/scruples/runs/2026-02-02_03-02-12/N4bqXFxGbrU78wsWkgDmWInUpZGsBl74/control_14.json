We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, which is causing some tension. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled because she started her period that day. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act like that, implying she could have tried harder. She got really upset, yelled, cried, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Periods can cause physical discomfort, and it's common for people to feel down or fatigued. The author acknowledges that she's usually laid back and great, but this one time he got impatient. He made plans weeks in advance, which she knew about. She canceled because of her period. He told her that other women he's known didn't act this way, which sounds like a comparison. Comparing her to others is a classic mistake in relationships. It can come off as dismissive of her feelings and needs.\n\nEven though he said it wasn't angrily and maybe passive-aggressive, making such a comment could be hurtful. By pointing out that other women manage better, he might be invalidating her experience. Every woman's body is different; some might handle periods better than others, or maybe she's having a particularly bad time. Also, the fact that her period comes \"semi-randomly\" adds to the unpredictability, which the author seems to struggle with.\n\nCommunication is key here. Instead of comparing, maybe he should have expressed his feelings about the plans without dismissing her needs. However, he did plan it in advance, so expecting her to go out despite feeling unwell might not be unreasonable. But the way he communicated his disappointment was problematic. Comparisons like \"other women\" can make the other person feel inadequate or not supported.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, and locking herself in. That's a strong response, but it might be because the comment hit a nerve. She might feel that her pain isn't being acknowledged. The author's comment could have made her feel unappreciated or criticized for her body's natural cycles.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's mistake was in the way he communicated his feelings. Even if his intention was to express frustration about the plan, using a comparison to other women was a poor choice. He should have approached it with more empathy, perhaps discussing how he felt about the plans while also acknowledging her discomfort. The key issue here is the lack of supportive communication, which led to her feeling attacked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because his comment was dismissive and invalidating, contributing to the conflict.\n"
