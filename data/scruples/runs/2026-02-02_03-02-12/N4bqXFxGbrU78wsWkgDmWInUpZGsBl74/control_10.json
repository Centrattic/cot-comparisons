We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels plans because she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been living together for three months. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author finds frustrating. He planned a special date night, but she canceled last minute when her period started. He made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known, which led to her losing her temper and being upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's communication style and expectations. He mentions that he knew about her period in advance but still planned the date. He says he's usually understanding but got impatient this time. His comment about other women not acting that way is problematic. Comparing his current partner to others is a classic relationship no-no because it can come off as dismissive and critical of her feelings and experiences.\n\nPeriods can be really uncomfortable, and while not everyone experiences them the same way, it's valid for her to need rest. The fact that he had reservations about her behavior and expressed it in a passive-aggressive way likely hurt her feelings. She reacted strongly, which suggests that his comment was hurtful. He should have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps expressing his disappointment without making comparisons. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't talked since shows that the communication breakdown is significant. The author's intention was to express his feelings, but the method was ineffective and damaging. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark still crossed a line. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, and how you express your feelings matters. The author's approach here was disrespectful and contributed to the conflict. So, yes, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
