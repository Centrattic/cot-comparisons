We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels plans during her period. The key points here are the comparison to other women and the resulting argument.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date, which the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not making enough effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling him names and crying, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's frustration is understandable but his approach might be problematic. Comparing his partner to others can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. Even if it's not said angrily, suggesting she should handle her period better than others might invalidate her pain. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, could stem from feeling criticized or not supported during a time when she's already in discomfort.\n\nThe author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling upset, but the way he communicated his feelings\u2014by bringing up other women\u2014could be hurtful. It's important to acknowledge that everyone experiences their period differently, and expecting someone to push through physical discomfort isn't always fair. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that his words were deeply hurtful, which suggests that the author did overstep, even if his intention was to express his feelings.\n\nSo, while the author might not be in the worst possible position, his method of expressing his frustration contributed to the conflict. Therefore, he might share some responsibility in the situation, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
