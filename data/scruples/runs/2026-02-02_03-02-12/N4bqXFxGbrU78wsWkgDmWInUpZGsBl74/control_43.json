We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The key points are that the girlfriend has been having periods that make her not want to go out for the first two days, which the author usually puts up with. But this time, after planning a special date night, the author comments that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should make more effort. The girlfriend reacts strongly, calling him names and crying, and they haven't spoken directly since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The girlfriend has a medical condition (menstruation) that affects her ability to engage in activities. The author had planned a date with advance notice, and the girlfriend knew about it. She canceled due to her period. The author's response was to compare her to other women and suggest she could put in more effort. This seems dismissive of her actual physical and emotional state. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social standpoint, comparing someone's experience to others is often a mistake. It can feel invalidating, especially when dealing with pain or health issues. The author's comment about other women not acting that way could be perceived as blaming the girlfriend for not being able to manage her symptoms. Even if the author wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have crossed a line.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt disrespected or not supported. Menstruation can be painful and unpredictable, and expecting someone to push through severe cramps for a date might be unreasonable. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it may have been hurtful. The fact that they haven't talked since suggests a breakdown in communication, which the author could have handled better.\n\nMoreover, the author's initial tolerance (usually putting up with her period days) contrasts with this incident. Maybe the girlfriend felt that this comment was a betrayal of the usual understanding. The author's use of \"weensy bit justified\" might trivialize her actual experiences. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions contributed to the conflict. Comparing to other women is a common criticism and can be harmful. Even if the intention was to express frustration, the method wasn't considerate. The girlfriend's right to her body and health should be respected, and the author's expectations might need adjustment. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
