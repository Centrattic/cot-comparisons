We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and he gets upset, especially since they had a special date night. He mentions that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, so he feels she could put in more effort. She reacted very strongly, calling him names and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend is experiencing period cramps and doesn't want to go out, the author planned a special date, she canceled, he expressed his feelings (passively-aggressively), and she had an intense reaction.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. From what I know, period cramps can be really severe for some women, affecting their ability to function normally. It's natural for someone in pain to want to rest. The author planned a date she knew about weeks in advance but canceled it when she was unwell. \n\nThe author's comment about other women not acting like this could come off as insensitive. Comparing her to other women might make her feel unappreciated or like her pain isn't valid. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark could be hurtful. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or that her needs weren't considered.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. The author might not realize how his words affected her. He could have approached the situation differently, maybe by checking in with her about her comfort level instead of making a comment about other women. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have communicated her needs earlier or found a compromise. But given the context, the main issue here is the author's response. He had plans, but when she's in pain, it's important to prioritize her well-being. His frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was probably not constructive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his comment was dismissive of her experience and led to a major conflict. He could have shown more understanding instead of comparing her to others.\n"
