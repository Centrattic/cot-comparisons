We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset with their girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not making enough effort. She got extremely upset, yelled at him, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's complaint is about his girlfriend canceling plans during her period. He mentions that others he's known don't act this way. He says he's not angry but maybe passive-aggressive. The girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, and locking herself in her room. \n\nFrom a general perspective, everyone's body is different. Periods can be really painful for some people. Even if some women handle it differently, it's not fair to compare. The author planned something in advance, which is understandable, but he should have considered her needs. However, the way he expressed his frustration\u2014comparing her to others\u2014might have been hurtful. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author didn't confront the issue directly but made a passive-aggressive comment. That's a bad approach because it can come off as disrespectful. He should have discussed his feelings without putting her down. Also, he should have considered that her pain is real and valid, and maybe find a compromise next time instead of expecting her to push through discomfort. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was strong, but it's possible she felt disrespected. When someone compares their partner to others, especially in a way that implies the partner is inadequate, it can be deeply hurtful. The author's comment about other women might have made her feel like her experience isn't valid. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's communication style. Even if he was frustrated, the way he expressed it was inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized. The author should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding, rather than making comparisons. Therefore, he is in the wrong for the way he handled the situation, even if his underlying frustration is somewhat understandable.\n"
