He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about discovering their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to the end of a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author met someone at art school, became friends, then developed a romantic relationship. The trans individual didn't disclose their gender identity until a sexual encounter was about to happen. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't tell them earlier, and now they're not attracted anymore. The trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after finding out. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction waned once they realized the person isn't male. The trans person might have felt they couldn't disclose earlier, maybe due to fear of rejection or other reasons. However, withholding such important information could be a problem. \n\nBut the author's point is that the trans person didn't disclose, leading to a situation where the author felt misled. In many relationships, honesty about gender identity is considered important. If the trans person waited until a sexual encounter to reveal this, that could be seen as deceptive, especially if it's a deal-breaker for the other person. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not in the wrong for being straight and not being attracted to a trans woman. It's their right to be honest about their preferences. The trans person might have had valid reasons for not disclosing earlier, but the timing of the revelation is crucial. The author's reaction is about feeling lied to because the information was withheld during the relationship.\n\nThe author also wants to maintain a friendship but the trans person is angry. The author isn't being manipulative; they're reacting to discovering something that affects their attraction. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or hurt, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship they're not comfortable with. \n\nIn terms of societal norms and ethics, people can have different views on attraction and gender identity. The key here is whether the trans person was honest and the author's right to act on their feelings. Since the author didn't know until the last moment, ending the relationship isn't wrong. The fault might lie more with the trans person for not being upfront, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to end the relationship upon discovering something that affects their attraction. The trans person's disclosure method could be problematic, but the author isn't at fault for their reaction.\n"
