He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering their crush is transgender and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and the trans person were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and during a near-sex encounter, the author discovered the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so they ended the relationship. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. In many places, being transgender is protected under anti-discrimination laws. However, this is about a personal relationship, not discrimination. The main issue is whether the trans person was deceptive. If they presented as male and the author believed they were a cisgender man, then the author might not be at fault for not knowing. However, the trans person might have a right to privacy regarding their gender identity.\n\nThe author's reaction: They felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose early on. But the trans person might have been waiting for the right time or felt unsafe to share. The author ended the relationship, which is their right, but the trans person's anger could stem from feeling rejected or invalidated. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the trans person didn't misrepresent their gender intentionally, then the author isn't at fault for their feelings. However, if the trans person used a deadname or false pronouns, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention that. The author's attraction being based on a penis is a personal preference, not malicious. Ending the relationship isn't evil, but the way the author handled it (stopping immediately) might have been abrupt. \n\nThe trans person's anger might stem from feeling their identity is being rejected, which is a valid concern. But the author isn't obligated to be attracted to them. The key is whether the trans person misrepresented themselves. If they didn't, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author's actions aren't malicious; they're acting on their personal preferences. So the answer is B.\n"
