He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their crush is trans and then lost their attraction, leading to a breakup. The author is now facing backlash from the trans person, who is upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they're straight and aren't attracted to vaginas. They mention that the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, which made the author feel lied to. But was the trans person actually lying? If the person identifies as trans and presents as male, maybe they didn't see it as a lie. Also, the author approached the situation by not continuing the relationship, which the trans person is upset about.\n\nNow, ethical considerations. The author's attraction is a personal preference. They aren't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone. But the trans person's disclosure timing is a factor. Did they have a responsibility to mention it earlier? It's complicated because some trans people choose when and how to share their identity. The author might feel blindsided, but it's not the trans person's fault for waiting until a physical moment to reveal it.\n\nThe author's reaction: they stopped the encounter and expressed their feelings. They want to remain friends but aren't in love anymore. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or invalidated. However, the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they aren't attracted. The trans person might have a right to feel hurt, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings.\n\nAlso, the author isn't being offensive for stating their preferences. It's okay to be straight and not want to be in a relationship with someone who has a vagina. The trans person's reaction of calling the author evil and manipulative seems over the top and possibly hurtful, which doesn't excuse the author from any wrongdoing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to lack of attraction after learning about the trans identity. They tried to handle it respectfully. The trans person's anger is valid in feeling rejected, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
