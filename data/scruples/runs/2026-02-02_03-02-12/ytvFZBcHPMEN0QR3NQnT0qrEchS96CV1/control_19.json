He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author realizing their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to a breakup and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone, became close friends, started dating, and during a moment of intimacy found out the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. The trans person is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main ethical questions here are about honesty in relationships and the author's reaction. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until a very intimate moment. That could be seen as a lack of transparency, especially if the author considers gender a key factor in their attraction. However, gender identity is a personal matter, and when to disclose it can vary. Some might choose to come out early, others later, depending on their comfort.\n\nThe author's reaction is to lose attraction and decide not to continue the relationship. The question is if that makes them an asshole. Since the author is clear they're straight and the trans person's anatomy didn't match their attraction, the author isn't being dishonest. They're acting on their own preferences. The trans person might have felt they were being authentic when they chose to share their identity during intimacy, but if they had known the author's stance on gender, they might have discussed it earlier. However, the author didn't ask about it either.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations complicate things. They might feel betrayed, but the author isn't hiding their sexuality. The author is also trying to maintain friendship. The key here is mutual honesty. If the trans person waited until an intimate moment to disclose something the author considers essential, it's a communication breakdown. But the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship where they're not attracted.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their attraction. People have the right to know if something is a deal-breaker for them. The trans person's disclosure might have been late, but the author's reaction is justified if they're not attracted. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
