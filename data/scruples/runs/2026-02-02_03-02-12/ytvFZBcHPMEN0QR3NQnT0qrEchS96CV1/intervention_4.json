He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. They're the one who found out their crush is trans and stopped being attracted to them, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they only realized the person was trans during a sexual encounter. The trans person didn't disclose this earlier, which the author feels is a lie. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the relationship's physical aspect became an issue after the fact.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The trans person's right to privacy and when to disclose their identity is important. However, in a romantic relationship, certain personal details are usually expected to be shared. The author might feel misled if the trans individual waited until a sexual moment to reveal this. \n\nBut the author also acknowledges the trans person's struggle to be themselves. The anger from the trans person might stem from feeling rejected or invalidated, which complicates things. The author isn't being cruel; they're honest about their attraction. The problem is the trans person didn't disclose earlier, which could be a communication issue.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to disclose gender identity unless it's relevant. However, in relationships, transparency is a mutual expectation. The author's reaction is about personal preferences, which are valid. They're not attacking the trans person's identity but their own lack of attraction. The trans person's anger might be disproportionate, but the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their feelings.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship after discovering something they weren't attracted to, especially if it wasn't disclosed earlier. They're honest about their limitations and still want to remain friends.\n"
