He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. Hmm. The author met someone, they became close, and when they were about to have sex, the author discovered the person was trans. The author then stopped and later wanted to continue as friends but not more. The trans person got upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author mentions they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. They felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The trans person had the opportunity to share this info before things got intimate but didn't. The author's attraction faded after the discovery. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship.\n\nI think it's important to recognize that being trans is part of someone's identity. The trans person might have chosen when to disclose this, maybe due to fear, privacy, or personal timing. However, in a romantic context, honesty is crucial. The author could argue they were honest about their preferences, but the trans person didn't share their identity early enough. But wait, the author didn't know until that moment. The trans person might have felt ready to share later, but the author's reaction was that they felt lied to because it was withheld during the relationship's progression.\n\nThe author's response was to stop the interaction and clarify their boundaries. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not accepted. But the author is not at fault for their feelings; they can't change their attraction. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author tried to be respectful, acknowledging the trans person's struggles. The author's main issue is the lack of prior disclosure leading to a loss of attraction.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, people have the right to choose their partners based on their preferences. The author isn't wrong for being honest about their attraction. The trans person's disclosure timing might be a point of contention, but the author can't be blamed for not being attracted to a vagina if they identify as straight. The author's decision to continue friendship shows they respect the person but have different romantic feelings. The trans person's anger might be more about their own hurt feelings than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They expressed their feelings honestly and tried to maintain a friendship. The trans person's reaction is unfortunate, but the author acted within their rights to be truthful about their attraction.\n"
