He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a crush on someone they went to art school with, and they started dating. During a moment of intimacy, the author discovered that their crush is trans and doesn't have a penis. The author then lost interest, and the crush is upset, calling them names. The author is confused about whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier, which the author feels was a lie. The author stopped the intimate encounter and wanted to stay friends but not date anymore. The trans person is upset and angry, leading the author to question their own actions.\n\nThe main issue here is about honesty and when information is disclosed. The trans person didn't reveal their identity until the moment of intimacy. The author feels it was a lie because they had months of friendship and dating without knowing. The author then made a decision based on their attraction, which is valid for them. But does that make them the asshole?\n\nI should think about societal norms and the expectations around gender identity disclosure. In many cases, people don't disclose such personal information early on unless it's relevant. However, in the context of a romantic relationship, especially when physical intimacy is involved, some might argue that it's important to know certain things. But others might say that it's not the trans person's responsibility to disclose unless it's a deal-breaker for the other person.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel; they're stating that they're not attracted to vaginas and that this changes their perspective. It's their personal preference. However, the trans person might have felt that the author should have been more understanding or that the author is using the trans status as an excuse. The author is also trying to maintain the friendship, which is a positive step.\n\nThe trans person's reaction seems extreme, calling the author evil and manipulative. That might be an overreaction, but it's also possible they're feeling rejected and hurt. The author isn't in a position to be blamed if they're being honest about their feelings. They can't be expected to change their attractions, and it's not their responsibility to accept something they're not into.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have had the opportunity to disclose earlier, but maybe they felt it wasn't the right time or they were scared. The author's main mistake might be not addressing the issue with more empathy, but given that they're not in a committed relationship yet, it's still their choice.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their feelings and have a right to their attractions. The trans person's anger might stem from their own insecurities or pain, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
