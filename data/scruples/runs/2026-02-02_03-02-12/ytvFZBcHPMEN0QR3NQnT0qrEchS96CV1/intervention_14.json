He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a crush on someone, they became close friends, and started a romantic relationship. The key point is that the author found out midway that their crush is trans, and upon seeing that the person doesn't have a penis, the attraction faded. The author stops the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the trans person withheld information. The author is straight, so the trans identity is a deal-breaker for them. The trans person didn't disclose this fact, which the author considers important. But the trans person might have been waiting for the right time or felt uncomfortable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for ending the relationship after discovering this? The author isn't being malicious; they're just not attracted to someone with a vagina. However, the trans person might have felt they were in a relationship long enough to trust the author with their identity. The author might be seen as not being honest about their preferences from the start. But the trans person didn't disclose their status either. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If the trans person was expecting the author to be open to a trans partner, they might have felt the author should have known. But the author could argue that they didn't know the trans person's identity, so they couldn't have considered it. The trans person's reaction seems harsh, calling the author evil and manipulative, which is unfair. \n\nThe author's issue is about attraction based on gender identity. It's not about race or other factors that might be more obvious. The trans person might have transitioned, so the author didn't know. The author isn't being discriminatory if they're clear about their preferences. The trans person might have been hoping the author would accept their identity, but the author's attraction is based on biological factors. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they can't help their attraction. However, maybe the trans person had the right to be upset if they felt the author was using their identity as an excuse. But given the scenario, the author is honest about their feelings now. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision based on their attraction, which is personal. The trans person's reaction is more extreme, suggesting the issue might be on their side. The author isn't being malicious, just honest about their feelings after the fact.\n"
