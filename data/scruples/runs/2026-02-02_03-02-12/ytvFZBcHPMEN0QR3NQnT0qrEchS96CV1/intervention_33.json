He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was dating someone who is trans, but when they found out the person was trans, their attraction disappeared. The author now wants to stay friends but not pursue a relationship anymore. The person they were dating is upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the trans person was truthful about their identity. The author mentions that the person didn't disclose being trans earlier. Wait, the story says that during the make-out session, the author discovered he wasn't a penis. But the person is trans, so maybe they have a vagina. The key here is whether he was upfront about his trans status. If he didn't tell the author before they got into a serious relationship, that might be an issue. However, maybe there are reasons he didn't disclose it earlier\u2014maybe he was unsure, or feared rejection, or felt it wasn't relevant yet. But the author feels lied to because it's a dealbreaker for them.\n\nThe author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They mention that if the person had told them earlier, they might have been able to work through it because they liked him. But since it was revealed during a vulnerable moment, it's too late, and their attraction is gone. They want to stay friends but not date anymore. The trans person is upset and called the author names, which seems harsh.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't ask for the person to change who they are. They have a right to their own feelings and attractions. If the trans person didn't disclose his status, maybe he was being honest about who he is, but the author has the right to feel how they do. The author isn't being cruel; they're just acknowledging their feelings. The trans person might have a right to feel hurt, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have considered that the person might not be comfortable sharing that detail earlier. But the author also has the right to their own boundaries. If the person didn't disclose, maybe he should have been honest sooner. But the author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious. They're not being judgmental about being trans, just stating their attraction is gone. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
