He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author, who found out their crush is trans and lost attraction, is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship with someone they later found out is trans. They mention they were dating, and the physical aspects led to the discovery. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans status earlier. They feel the trans person kept it hidden until the moment they were about to have sex, which made the author lose attraction. The author is now friends with them but doesn't want a romantic relationship, and the trans person is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are attraction, disclosure, and honesty in relationships. The author is strict about being straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier, which led to a breakdown in the relationship. The author is asking if their reaction is justified.\n\nIn terms of social norms, gender identity is a personal matter that individuals may choose to disclose when comfortable. However, in a romantic relationship, honesty about such aspects is important. The author feels it was a lie because the trans person didn't share this information earlier. But is that a lie? A trans person might not feel ready to disclose their identity, especially if they're transitioning or for safety reasons. The author's reaction is based on their own sexual orientation, which is valid. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or that the author is treating their identity as a dealbreaker.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel; they're stating their preferences. However, the trans person might feel they were leading the author on. But the author didn't know at the time. The dynamic here is complex. The author isn't in the wrong for losing attraction, as that's a personal preference. They are also not obligated to continue the relationship if the trans status is a dealbreaker for them. The trans person's reaction might be more about hurt feelings than the author being wrong. So the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
