He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the author discovers their partner is transgender. The key points here are communication, timing of disclosure, and the author's feelings post-discovery.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the partner didn't disclose being trans until a point where they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to because they consider that information important. The partner had months of friendship and dating, during which they could have shared this aspect of their identity. However, the partner chose not to mention it until that specific moment.\n\nThe author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the discovery led to a loss of attraction. They want to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship. The partner is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, which adds conflict.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The partner's failure to disclose their transgender identity at an appropriate time is a significant issue. In any relationship, especially one moving towards intimacy, sharing personal information like gender identity is crucial. The partner's decision to wait until the moment of intimacy could be seen as a lack of transparency, which might justify the author's feelings of being misled.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their personal preferences. They are not in a position where they can be blamed for their attractions. The problem here is more on the partner's side for not being upfront. The author isn't rejecting the partner's identity itself but the physical aspect that aligns with their sexual orientation. It's important to differentiate between rejection of a person's identity and their physical characteristics. The author is rejecting the physical aspect due to their strict straight orientation, which is a personal preference, not a moral failing.\n\nThe partner's anger and labeling the author as manipulative seems disproportionate. The author is honest about their feelings post-discovery and wants to maintain a friendship. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling rejected, but it's not the author's fault for being honest about their attractions.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong. The partner's failure to communicate a significant aspect of their identity in a timely manner is the root issue here. The author's response is a legitimate reaction to being misled and discovering something that affects their attraction at a critical moment.\n"
