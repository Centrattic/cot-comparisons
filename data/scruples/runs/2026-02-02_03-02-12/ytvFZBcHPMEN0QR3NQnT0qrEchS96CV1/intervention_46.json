He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. The situation is that they were dating, and during a moment of intimacy, the author discovered he didn't have a penis. The author then lost interest because they're strictly straight, but they feel the person should have told them earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The trans person didn't disclose their identity upfront. In many relationships, honesty is key. If someone is trans, especially if their gender identity might affect the other person's attraction, it's generally considered important to communicate that. However, the timeline matters here. The author mentions that they were friends for months and it developed into a romantic relationship over time. The trans person might have felt they needed to build trust before sharing such a personal detail.\n\nBut the author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. The problem here is that the trans person didn't come out earlier, leading to the author feeling misled. The author isn't rejecting the person for who they are as a person but for a specific physical aspect that's important to their attraction. There's a difference between being trans and having a certain anatomy. The author's reaction is about physical attraction, not about the person's identity as a whole.\n\nThe trans person might have faced their own challenges in being open, perhaps due to fear of rejection or discrimination. But in a romantic context, it's reasonable to expect that both parties share necessary information about their bodies, especially when it comes to physical intimacy. The author wasn't being asked to accept a different gender identity but rather a specific anatomical reality that they found important.\n\nThe author's decision to stop the relationship isn't out of malice but because their attraction changed. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or that their truth was a deal-breaker. However, the author isn't in the wrong for having preferences they can't overcome. It's a matter of personal compatibility, not being offensive or malicious.\n\nBut is the author wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship? Probably not. They have the right to their feelings and preferences. The trans person might have made a mistake by not disclosing earlier, but that doesn't make the author in the wrong for reacting as they did. The key here is whether the author acted with intent to deceive, which they didn't. They were honest about their feelings once they knew, even though they chose to end the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to their feelings and the trans person should have been more transparent earlier if that information was critical. The author's reaction is a personal choice based on their preferences, not a malicious act.\n"
