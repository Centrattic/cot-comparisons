He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. The situation is that the author and their crush started dating, developed a close relationship, and during a moment of intimacy, the author discovered the crush is trans. The author then stopped the interaction and later expressed that they can't continue the relationship because they're straight. The crush is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They mention that they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The key point here is whether the author had the right to feel this way and not continue the relationship. It's important to note that being straight is a valid sexual orientation, and people have the right to their preferences.\n\nNext, the trans person's perspective. The author found out about the trans identity during a physical moment, which might be why they feel it was a lie. However, the question is whether the trans person was obligated to disclose this information earlier. The author states that the trans person had months to tell them, but they didn't. However, disclosure of such personal information is a complex issue. Some people might feel comfortable sharing their identity early, others might not, especially if they're not out themselves or fear rejection.\n\nThe author is now facing backlash from the trans person, being called evil and manipulative. This seems like emotional manipulation from the trans person's side, trying to deflect blame by accusing the author of faking the friendship. The author's intention was to be honest about their feelings and not force a relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong because they're being truthful about their attractions. The trans person might have been in the wrong for not disclosing their identity earlier if that was a crucial factor for the author. However, the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted to the person anymore, even if the person is trans. The key here is mutual honesty and respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author wants to maintain the friendship, which is a positive step. They're not seeking to harm but to clarify their feelings. The trans person's reaction seems more about their own hurt and perhaps a lack of acceptance of the author's orientation, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to express their feelings and not pursue a romantic relationship. The trans person's anger and accusations are not justified in this scenario. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
