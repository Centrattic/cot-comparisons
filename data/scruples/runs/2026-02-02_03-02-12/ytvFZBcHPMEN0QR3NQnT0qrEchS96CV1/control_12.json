He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a crush on someone they later found out is trans, and their attraction faded once they found out. Now the other person is upset and calling them names, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and their crush were in a romantic relationship, or at least a dating-like situation, with physical intimacy. The author didn't know the person was trans until during a moment when they were about to have sex. The person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so after the revelation, their attraction decreased. Now the other person is angry, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after finding out the person is trans. The author didn't know, and the other person didn't disclose it until the last moment. The author is not attracted to women, so the fact that their crush is trans (assuming he identifies as male) might be a deal-breaker. \n\nNow, considering that the other person didn't tell them earlier, which the author feels is important. The author might feel like there was a lack of transparency. But the author isn't the one who hid their identity. Also, the author is being honest about their feelings and preferences. \n\nTrans people often face discrimination and being treated as less than, so if the author is being honest about their attractions, that's a personal preference. However, the timing of the disclosure is important. The other person could have told them earlier, which might have allowed the author to process it before getting too close. But the author is also not to blame for not knowing. \n\nThe other person's reaction seems extreme. Calling the author an asshole for ending the relationship might be their way of dealing with the rejection, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their feelings and preferences. They can't be expected to be attracted to someone if their identity is a factor they weren't aware of. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They didn't know, the other person didn't disclose until a critical moment, and the author is honest about their orientation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
