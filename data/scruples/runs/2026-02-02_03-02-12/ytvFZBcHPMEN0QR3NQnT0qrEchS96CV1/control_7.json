He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the author discovered their crush is trans and then lost attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their partner became close friends over months, developed a romantic relationship, and were about to have sex when the author found out the partner is trans. The author feels lied to because the partner didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The partner is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question their own actions.\n\nNow, the main ethical consideration here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after discovering this information. The author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference. The partner didn't disclose their trans status, which the author now sees as a lie. However, the partner might have had reasons for not disclosing earlier, such as personal readiness or fear of rejection.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to recognize that people have the right to their own preferences in partners. The author isn't wrong for being straight. However, the partner might have had a responsibility to disclose their identity earlier if it's a significant factor in the relationship. But the timeline here is months of friendship and a budding romantic relationship without disclosure. That could be seen as the partner's issue, not the author's.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014feeling lied to and ending the relationship\u2014is a personal choice based on their values. They're not in the wrong for choosing to stop the relationship, especially if they feel the partner didn't be honest. The partner's anger and accusations seem hurtful, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending things. \n\nAlso, the author wants to remain friends, which shows they're trying to handle it respectfully. The partner's reaction (calling them evil) is more about their own hurt feelings. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their response is based on their personal preferences and the lack of disclosure from the partner. The key here is that the author isn't being malicious; they're acting on their genuine feelings and the information they received. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
