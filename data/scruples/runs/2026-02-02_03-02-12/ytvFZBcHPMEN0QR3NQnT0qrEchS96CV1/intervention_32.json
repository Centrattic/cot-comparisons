He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong after finding out their crush is transgender and losing attraction. The key points here involve the author's feelings of being lied to, the timing of the revelation, and the subsequent conflict.\n\nFirst, the author started a relationship with someone they found attractive, shared interests, and built a friendship. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until during a sexual encounter. The author feels that this was a lie, as the trans person didn't mention it earlier. They value honesty and consider gender identity important, so the delayed disclosure affected their attraction. Now, they want to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship, which has led to conflict and accusations from the other person.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're not in the wrong because they prefer straight relationships and couldn't overcome the lack of disclosure. They feel it's valid to have personal boundaries about attraction and are not to blame for not continuing the relationship. The other person is upset, but the author is clear about their stance.\n\nFrom a perspective of honesty and transparency in relationships, there's a case that the trans person should have shared their identity earlier. However, sometimes people might not disclose such information upfront for various reasons, like fear of rejection or not considering it relevant yet. But in a romantic context, especially when physical intimacy is involved, withholding information about gender identity could be seen as a significant omission.\n\nOn the author's side, they are honest about their preferences. They don't claim to be judgmental but are clear that their attraction is based on certain factors. It's their right to decide who they're attracted to. The fact that they tried to maintain a friendship shows they value the person as a friend, even if they can't be romantic partners. The other person's reaction seems extreme, calling the author names, which might reflect their own insecurities rather than the author's fault.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't being intentionally harmful. They're expressing their genuine feelings and preferences. The trans person's actions, while possibly not malicious, might have led to a situation where the author felt misled. But it's also important to recognize that gender identity disclosure can be a personal choice, and the author's reaction is about their own limitations in attraction, not a moral failing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They made clear their preferences, and the situation highlights the importance of communication in relationships. The answer should be B.\n"
