He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush who is trans, and the author lost attraction after finding out. The author is being accused of being evil and manipulative by the trans person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone, became friends, and developed a relationship. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until a sexual encounter. The author feels lied to because the person didn't share this information earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. The trans person is upset and calling the author names.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The trans person's disclosure timing is crucial here. If they didn't share this important information before the relationship became intimate, that's a problem. The author had a right to know about their partner's gender identity to make an informed decision about the relationship, especially regarding physical intimacy.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. They felt misled, which is a valid feeling in this context. The trans person might have had valid reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe due to fear of rejection or personal struggles. But the author isn't responsible for the trans person's feelings or choices. The author's decision to not continue the relationship isn't malicious; it's about personal preferences and boundaries.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations seem extreme. Calling the author an evil manipulator isn't justified if the author is being honest about their feelings. The author is also trying to maintain the friendship, which shows they're not trying to be hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the trans person didn't disclose important information that affects the relationship's nature. The author isn't at fault for having preferences about their partner's anatomy. It's a matter of honesty and communication in relationships. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their lack of attraction after the fact. So the answer should be B.\n"
