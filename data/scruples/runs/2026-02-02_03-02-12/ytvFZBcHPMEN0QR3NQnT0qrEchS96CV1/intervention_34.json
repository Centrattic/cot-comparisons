He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had a crush on someone they met at art school, and they started dating. The person is trans, and the author found out when they were about to have sex. Now they feel less attracted because they're strictly straight and not into vaginas. The trans person is upset and called them names. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author didn't know the person was trans until they were about to have sex. The trans person didn't disclose this earlier, even though they were in a dating relationship. The author's attraction is based on being straight, so this is a dealbreaker for them. The trans person is now angry, claiming the author is manipulative, which seems like a reaction to being rejected.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. It's generally important to be honest about one's identity in a romantic relationship, especially regarding gender and sexuality. The trans person did have a responsibility to disclose this earlier, especially since it's a significant aspect of their identity that could affect the relationship. The author is being honest about their own feelings and attractions, which is valid. People have preferences, and if something comes up that changes their attraction, that's not necessarily the person's fault if the information was withheld until a late stage.\n\nBut wait, the trans person might have been nervous or unsure about when to disclose, especially if they were still in the process of coming to terms with their identity themselves. However, in a romantic relationship where physical intimacy is happening, the expectation is that such details should be known and discussed. The author's reaction is about their own lack of attraction, which is a personal choice. The trans person's anger seems more about rejection than about the author being wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were honest about their feelings after discovering a fact that affects their attraction. The trans person made a choice to not disclose earlier, which could be seen as a mistake, but it doesn't make the author the asshole for ending the relationship. The author wants to remain friends, which is respectful. The trans person's accusations might stem from hurt feelings rather than the author having done something wrong.\n"
