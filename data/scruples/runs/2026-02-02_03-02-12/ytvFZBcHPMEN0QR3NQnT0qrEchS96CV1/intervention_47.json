He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they discovered their crush is trans and then their attraction faded, leading to a breakup and some conflict. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they found out the person was trans during a moment of intimacy. The trans person waited until that point to disclose their gender identity. The author feels lied to because they believe that information was important and should have been shared earlier.\n\nNow, in terms of ethics, gender identity is a personal aspect. Some people feel it's important to disclose that early in a relationship, especially if it's a factor in the other person's attraction. But others might feel it's their right to share their identity when they're ready. \n\nThe author isn't saying the trans person is lying about being trans, just that they felt the information was withheld until a key moment. The author's response is to end the romantic relationship, which they clarify is because they're strictly straight and don't find vaginas attractive. That seems like a personal preference they're honest about. \n\nThe trans person reacted angrily, calling the author evil and manipulative, which might indicate they felt betrayed. But the author is trying to maintain a friendship while ending the romance. \n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for not continuing the relationship. Since the author isn't transphobic but is straight, their lack of attraction isn't wrong. The trans person's timing of disclosure might be questionable, but the author's reaction of ending the relationship because of their own preferences isn't inherently wrong. The author is clear about their boundaries and is not being malicious. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice based on their own attractions, which is valid, even if the situation was handled awkwardly.\n"
