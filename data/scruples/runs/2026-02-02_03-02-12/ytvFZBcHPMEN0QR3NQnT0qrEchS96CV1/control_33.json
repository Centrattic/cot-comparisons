He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the person (the author) started dating someone they met at art school. They developed a relationship, became close, and were about to have sex when the author discovered the person is trans. The key point is that the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. The author now feels their attraction faded and doesn't want to continue the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm, so I need to evaluate the situation. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity, which the author considers important. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person might have a vagina but identifies as male. Wait, actually, the term \"trans\" can be a bit ambiguous here. If the person is trans and was assigned female at birth but transitioned, they might be a trans man. So, in that case, they would have a vagina but identify as male. But the author is straight and only attracted to penises. So the author's attraction is based on biological sex. However, the trans person's gender identity is male, which they might have mentioned earlier.\n\nThe author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this information sooner. The author is now not interested in continuing the relationship. The trans person is upset and called the author names, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to know certain information that affects their comfort in a relationship. However, when is the right time to disclose such information? If the trans person felt safe enough to transition during the relationship, maybe they had reasons for not sharing earlier. But if the author needed that information to decide on a romantic relationship, then the trans person could have shared it sooner to avoid the situation.\n\nBut the author is now saying they don't want to continue the relationship because they're not attracted to someone with a vagina. Is that offensive? The author is being honest about their preferences, even though it might not be politically correct. But they're not attacking the trans person's identity; they're stating their own feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or misunderstood, but that doesn't make the author wrong for their own feelings.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. Since they're not being abusive, just honest about their attraction, and the trans person didn't disclose early enough, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to their preferences, even if they can't change them. The trans person might need to work on accepting that the author isn't compatible, even if they liked them as a person.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're acting based on their own feelings and honesty, which is valid. The trans person's anger is misplaced if they didn't communicate their identity earlier.\n"
