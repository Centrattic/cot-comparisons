He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. The person feels lied to because the trans individual didn't disclose their identity earlier. The author then ends the relationship, which upsets the other person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't come out before the relationship became sexual. The author felt it was too late to adjust their feelings when they found out during intimacy.\n\nNow, legal and moral aspects. In many places, being transgender is protected under anti-discrimination laws. However, this is a personal relationship, not a legal issue. The key is consent and honesty. The trans person might have feared rejection, so they waited. But withholding such a significant detail that affects the relationship's foundation could be seen as not being fully honest.\n\nHowever, the author's attraction is a personal preference. They can't be blamed for not being attracted. The question is whether the trans person was deceptive. If the trans person identified as male and presented as such, the author might not consider it a lie. The trans person's identity is valid, but the author didn't know about their biological sex. If the trans person didn't disclose before intimacy, the author might feel misled.\n\nBut in relationships, people often reveal things gradually. The author might feel the trans person should have been upfront earlier. However, the trans person might have their reasons, like fear of rejection. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on their attraction, which is understandable. The trans person's anger might be due to feeling rejected or hurt, but it's not the author's fault for having different preferences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They ended the relationship because they aren't attracted, which is their right. The trans person's decision to not disclose earlier might be the issue, but the author isn't at fault for their feelings. Therefore, answer B.\n"
