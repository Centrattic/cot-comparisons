He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of their relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and the trans person became close friends, then started a romantic relationship. The author discovered the person is trans during an intimate moment. The author feels they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they ended the relationship. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to think about consent, honesty, and mutual respect. The trans person didn't disclose being trans until the intimate moment, which the author found out during a sexual act. The author is clear about being straight, so even if the trans person had told them earlier, the author might still not have been attracted. However, the trans person had the opportunity to share this information before the relationship became sexual. \n\nFrom what I know, being transgender is about one's gender identity, not necessarily about physical attributes. But in this case, the person is assigned male at birth and transitioned, so they have a penis. Wait, no, the author found out there was no penis. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the author was trying to go under his pants and found no bulge or a vagina. So the trans person is a trans woman who hasn't undergone full genital surgery. Therefore, she has female genitalia. The author is a man who is attracted to men, so he's straight. Wait, no, he's straight, meaning he's attracted to women. But if the trans woman is a woman in his eyes, but she's assigned male at birth. But he didn't know she was trans before the intimate moment. \n\nThe author's issue is that he didn't know she was trans until that moment, and since he's straight, he's not attracted to women. So he ended the relationship. The trans person feels hurt and accused the author of being manipulative. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is honest about his sexuality. He's not attracted to women, and he learned that the person he was with is a woman. The problem is that the trans person didn't disclose this information earlier. However, in many cases, people might not disclose their trans status unless asked, especially if they pass as their gender. But the author might have assumed the person was cisgender. \n\nThe author stopping the sexual act upon learning the truth is understandable. He's not in the wrong for being honest about his attraction. However, the way he reacted might have been abrupt. But the core issue is whether he's wrong for ending the relationship. \n\nThe trans person's anger might stem from feeling that the author judged her for her gender identity. However, the author is clear about his sexual orientation. The author isn't in the wrong here because he's being honest about his attraction. The trans person had the chance to share this information before the relationship became sexual. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
